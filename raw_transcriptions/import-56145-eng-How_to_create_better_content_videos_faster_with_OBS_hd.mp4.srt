1
0:00:00,000 --> 0:00:13,100
 That's become possible, at least for all my webcam and screen share videos.

2
0:00:13,100 --> 0:00:17,100
 So I'm going to share that with you today, how that is helping me, and hopefully you

3
0:00:17,100 --> 0:00:20,660
 can get some inspiration from that.

4
0:00:20,660 --> 0:00:26,920
 Either to improve your own setup or to see, hey, okay, that's maybe not so difficult.

5
0:00:26,920 --> 0:00:30,400
 Maybe I can start putting some videos out there as well.

6
0:00:30,400 --> 0:00:33,400
 So that's it.

7
0:00:33,400 --> 0:00:34,400
 Why am I doing this?

8
0:00:34,400 --> 0:00:41,160
 Well, that's because 11 years ago I quit my daytime job to become a writing instructor.

9
0:00:41,160 --> 0:00:49,240
 A year later I figured out that being a self-employed writing instructor with a small kid and a

10
0:00:49,240 --> 0:00:52,800
 family you want to see sometimes, that's not super easy.

11
0:00:52,840 --> 0:00:58,760
 So I decided I would try to take some of my teaching online.

12
0:00:58,760 --> 0:01:03,060
 Back then, ten years ago, we were like two people in Denmark who did online courses on

13
0:01:03,060 --> 0:01:04,180
 horse training.

14
0:01:04,180 --> 0:01:10,680
 So people were a bit like, oh, that's weird, but also pretty interested because it brought

15
0:01:10,680 --> 0:01:16,000
 some knowledge to them that they had a hard time obtaining in other ways without driving

16
0:01:16,000 --> 0:01:19,840
 a long while to get there or something like that.

17
0:01:19,840 --> 0:01:31,480
 So this is me ten years ago, almost to the date, end of August 2013, doing my first ever

18
0:01:31,480 --> 0:01:36,000
 webinar on horse training.

19
0:01:36,000 --> 0:01:45,320
 With a grainy webcam, probably the one that was actually built into my laptop and not

20
0:01:45,320 --> 0:01:47,560
 very good lightning, not very good sound.

21
0:01:47,720 --> 0:01:59,000
 Well, the sound was semi-decent, but everything was pretty blurry and not so super.

22
0:01:59,000 --> 0:02:03,480
 Also the internet connection back then was terrible.

23
0:02:03,480 --> 0:02:07,720
 But I managed.

24
0:02:07,720 --> 0:02:15,280
 It improved a wee bit pretty fast by switching webinar provider.

25
0:02:15,280 --> 0:02:26,480
 I've always been sort of both compassionate but also a bit picky about how my teaching

26
0:02:26,480 --> 0:02:31,680
 content shall be because I know it makes a difference for people.

27
0:02:31,680 --> 0:02:38,640
 I've used to be a teacher and I know it makes a difference to people if you're just providing

28
0:02:38,640 --> 0:02:42,560
 them talking slides or if you actually are there on webcam.

29
0:02:42,960 --> 0:02:50,560
 If it's a grainy old webcam with a fuzzy image, it makes a difference that people can actually

30
0:02:50,560 --> 0:02:56,120
 see you and can feel a connection to you when you're teaching online.

31
0:02:56,120 --> 0:03:06,600
 So I upgraded my system to something where I actually felt that they could see me better.

32
0:03:06,600 --> 0:03:10,760
 And that worked.

33
0:03:10,760 --> 0:03:18,000
 Then I started doing also not just live webinars but also recording videos.

34
0:03:18,000 --> 0:03:22,360
 And this here, this is some of the videos that took a long time to produce compared

35
0:03:22,360 --> 0:03:29,920
 to the video time because I had to record the slides presentation first or have the

36
0:03:29,920 --> 0:03:32,400
 images for that and put into my video editor.

37
0:03:32,400 --> 0:03:37,640
 Then I had to sit there and talk about the slides, record that, put them together, put

38
0:03:37,640 --> 0:03:47,760
 the logo on, put the text on, and that took usually longer than actually doing the video.

39
0:03:47,760 --> 0:03:51,120
 Then the video had to process afterwards before I could upload it.

40
0:03:51,120 --> 0:03:53,120
 It was boring.

41
0:03:53,120 --> 0:03:57,320
 That is like 2015.

42
0:03:57,320 --> 0:04:04,320
 Then in 2018, as I said, I met OBS at my first hack.

43
0:04:04,320 --> 0:04:11,800
 I had been looking at it previously because I heard someone talk about it at some marketing

44
0:04:11,800 --> 0:04:18,480
 webinar I had attended, but it was like, ah, it's difficult and I don't really know what

45
0:04:18,480 --> 0:04:20,800
 to do about it.

46
0:04:20,800 --> 0:04:26,040
 But then when I had my hands in it at BornHack, I was like, yeah, okay, oh, so there's something

47
0:04:26,040 --> 0:04:29,880
 about scenes and there's something about sources, ah, I get that now.

48
0:04:29,880 --> 0:04:32,400
 I can go back and use this.

49
0:04:32,400 --> 0:04:37,440
 Still took me six months because as far as I could tell when I was digging through my

50
0:04:37,440 --> 0:04:44,040
 archives yesterday, I only started using OBS in January 2019.

51
0:04:44,040 --> 0:04:47,600
 So that's like almost four and a half years ago now.

52
0:04:47,600 --> 0:04:51,200
 This is one of the first attempts.

53
0:04:51,200 --> 0:04:59,400
 Did a video series where I put myself in the corner and I had some background images that

54
0:04:59,400 --> 0:05:06,080
 I could switch like slides and that worked really well and it was still like a one-take

55
0:05:06,080 --> 0:05:07,320
 video.

56
0:05:07,320 --> 0:05:13,000
 Of course, doing one-take videos means that you need to actually know what you're going

57
0:05:13,000 --> 0:05:20,240
 to talk about and not make that many mistakes and stuff, but today, I much rather do if

58
0:05:20,240 --> 0:05:24,400
 I'm doing like a 10-minute video, I try not to make them longer, but if I'm doing like

59
0:05:24,400 --> 0:05:30,320
 a 10-minute video or a five-minute video, if something goes wrong, I just restart.

60
0:05:30,320 --> 0:05:38,260
 It's a lot faster than actually having to go back and edit out a cough attack or whatever.

61
0:05:38,260 --> 0:05:47,320
 So it really, really helps my flow in content creation.

62
0:05:47,320 --> 0:05:53,180
 This is then in May 2019 where I started doing screen share videos.

63
0:05:53,180 --> 0:05:59,300
 My business had then moved on from doing, as you can see, this has not much to do with

64
0:05:59,300 --> 0:06:01,940
 horses.

65
0:06:01,940 --> 0:06:08,960
 I'm now primarily teaching other people how to use the online course and email marketing

66
0:06:08,960 --> 0:06:10,820
 system called Simpliro.

67
0:06:10,820 --> 0:06:18,020
 I've been doing that since 2015, 2016, where it slowly took over.

68
0:06:18,020 --> 0:06:25,360
 So today, my main video production is videos where I'm on screen share and I show something

69
0:06:25,360 --> 0:06:33,480
 from inside Simpliro and tell people how to set up a course or create an email series

70
0:06:33,480 --> 0:06:39,620
 or do fancy automation stuff.

71
0:06:39,620 --> 0:06:48,060
 I started doing these courses also back in some time in 2019.

72
0:06:48,060 --> 0:06:51,380
 And this is what it looked like back then.

73
0:06:51,380 --> 0:06:54,620
 And this is then what it looks like today.

74
0:06:54,620 --> 0:07:00,860
 I've gone to green screen, so now I can just put myself in without sitting in a square

75
0:07:00,860 --> 0:07:04,220
 with some sort of background.

76
0:07:04,300 --> 0:07:10,060
 That's really nice and that's also built in in OBS.

77
0:07:10,060 --> 0:07:12,780
 Also I use this to stream.

78
0:07:12,780 --> 0:07:17,380
 This is actually from, I have like a membership club for people who are using Simpliro and

79
0:07:17,380 --> 0:07:25,780
 we do monthly themes and they are like live streamed to we have a Facebook group.

80
0:07:25,780 --> 0:07:29,360
 So I live stream it to the Facebook group using OBS.

81
0:07:29,360 --> 0:07:35,120
 So I get a high quality local recording of the stream because then it's not the stream,

82
0:07:35,120 --> 0:07:39,360
 then it's just what's happening on my desktop.

83
0:07:39,360 --> 0:07:44,620
 Then I also stream it to Facebook and then afterwards I take the recorded video from

84
0:07:44,620 --> 0:07:49,400
 my desktop computer and upload it to the course material in Simpliro.

85
0:07:49,400 --> 0:07:52,080
 So I have both this option.

86
0:07:52,080 --> 0:07:56,440
 I don't know, you're probably not that much of a Facebook crowd, but in Facebook, if you

87
0:07:56,520 --> 0:07:59,840
 do live, you can either do screen share or do webcam.

88
0:07:59,840 --> 0:08:01,400
 You can't combine them.

89
0:08:01,400 --> 0:08:05,700
 When I use OBS to stream, I can combine totally like I want.

90
0:08:05,700 --> 0:08:14,760
 So I have full control and I get the local recording in high quality and I could also

91
0:08:14,760 --> 0:08:22,880
 use this to stream to YouTube or any other service where you can stream with a stream

92
0:08:22,880 --> 0:08:23,880
 key.

93
0:08:24,840 --> 0:08:32,840
 So that's really, really nice and that makes my work so much easier also.

94
0:08:32,840 --> 0:08:41,920
 I've also been doing like if you want to teach something about like a creative process or

95
0:08:41,920 --> 0:08:45,600
 thought process, then it's not always the best.

96
0:08:45,600 --> 0:08:51,520
 People get so much, especially during Corona, people had so much of everything being online

97
0:08:51,640 --> 0:09:01,520
 and people just doing talking slide presentations and it kind of gets boring.

98
0:09:01,520 --> 0:09:05,120
 If you need to keep people's attention, then you should mix things up.

99
0:09:05,120 --> 0:09:11,280
 So what I have on my desk is I have a second webcam mounted on an arm so I can take that

100
0:09:11,280 --> 0:09:18,880
 and point it down on my desk and then I can have a writing pad and I can sketch up things

101
0:09:18,880 --> 0:09:27,680
 either if I want to design flows or I want to sketch out a thought process or whatever

102
0:09:27,680 --> 0:09:29,360
 it is I want to do.

103
0:09:29,360 --> 0:09:34,620
 I can actually do that and put that on webcam as well and then I still have myself down

104
0:09:34,620 --> 0:09:43,440
 in the corner so I can also look up, put down the pen and sit there and talk to people.

105
0:09:43,440 --> 0:09:48,440
 And this is I know from my students that they are like really happy about this way of doing

106
0:09:48,480 --> 0:09:49,480
 things.

107
0:09:49,480 --> 0:09:54,000
 I could also be standing by a white board or whatever I wanted to do that was like something

108
0:09:54,000 --> 0:09:55,000
 else.

109
0:09:55,000 --> 0:10:01,080
 I had been looking into, oh, maybe I should get one of those fancy drawing pads for my

110
0:10:01,080 --> 0:10:07,600
 computer and because I wanted to do some live drawing stuff and then I was like hmm, I have

111
0:10:07,600 --> 0:10:11,760
 an extra webcam, I have pen, I have paper, how does that work?

112
0:10:11,760 --> 0:10:16,120
 And that actually works excellent.

113
0:10:16,120 --> 0:10:23,440
 So that's a way of mixing things up and that's totally easy to set up several camera sources

114
0:10:23,440 --> 0:10:26,360
 in OBS.

115
0:10:26,360 --> 0:10:31,120
 And I can switch between the scenes so that I can do this and then I can switch to another

116
0:10:31,120 --> 0:10:36,600
 scene where I have screen share or I can switch to another scene where it's just me on webcam

117
0:10:36,600 --> 0:10:44,800
 and I can sort of spice my teaching up a bit without having to do all that editing that

118
0:10:44,920 --> 0:10:51,320
 For me, I know some people are probably editing faster than me but for me at least it takes

119
0:10:51,320 --> 0:10:54,560
 a lot of time and it isn't really worth it.

120
0:10:54,560 --> 0:11:00,560
 I could maybe get like two, three, four, five percent fancier videos if I decided to do

121
0:11:00,560 --> 0:11:05,320
 after editing but that's really, really not worth it.

122
0:11:05,320 --> 0:11:11,840
 So this is how things look today.

123
0:11:11,840 --> 0:11:17,480
 This is how it looks from inside OBS and in a second I'm going to switch over so you

124
0:11:17,480 --> 0:11:24,240
 can see I'm going to open OBS here on my machine and then we can take a look at how does this

125
0:11:24,240 --> 0:11:25,240
 actually work?

126
0:11:25,240 --> 0:11:28,280
 How do we set it up?

127
0:11:28,280 --> 0:11:30,760
 What do you need to be aware of?

128
0:11:30,760 --> 0:11:36,280
 And then there will be some room for questions.

129
0:11:36,280 --> 0:11:48,560
 So yeah, I wanted to show you my setup as well.

130
0:11:48,560 --> 0:11:52,960
 So this is my desktop at home being unusually tidy.

131
0:11:52,960 --> 0:11:58,840
 So I have like two screens because if you're working with OBS you can do that in a one

132
0:11:58,840 --> 0:12:06,040
 screen setup but it's really, really, really nice to have like two screens so you can have

133
0:12:06,360 --> 0:12:09,560
 whatever you are, if you're doing a screen share, then you have whatever you're working

134
0:12:09,560 --> 0:12:16,440
 with on the front screen and then you have OBS or if you have some chat you need to pay

135
0:12:16,440 --> 0:12:20,320
 attention to, you have that on the other screen.

136
0:12:20,320 --> 0:12:24,520
 That's a really, really big help and I also highly recommend that even if you don't use

137
0:12:24,520 --> 0:12:33,560
 OBS, if you're doing any other sort of webinars or anything where you need to be able to both

138
0:12:33,640 --> 0:12:39,880
 screen share something or have your slides and also keep an eye on a chat or some other

139
0:12:39,880 --> 0:12:46,600
 tech that is running, it's really, really, really a lot easier if you have at least two

140
0:12:46,600 --> 0:12:49,000
 screens.

141
0:12:49,000 --> 0:12:55,560
 I teach a lot of my clients are like not very techy and when I come and say yeah, you should

142
0:12:55,560 --> 0:13:01,280
 probably get an extra screen and they're like but I only have my MacBook and then we'll

143
0:13:01,440 --> 0:13:07,840
 have to figure out how to attach an extra screen because it's just so much easier.

144
0:13:07,840 --> 0:13:14,800
 I have a microphone and I have an external webcam and that's basically it.

145
0:13:14,800 --> 0:13:23,640
 What you maybe can see in the corners of the desk is I have a couple of that's like 20

146
0:13:24,520 --> 0:13:32,520
 halogen, not halogen, LED working lights that are pointing away from me because they create

147
0:13:32,520 --> 0:13:41,400
 a pretty good ambient light so that's a lot easier than buying some very fancy studio

148
0:13:41,400 --> 0:13:43,320
 lights.

149
0:13:43,320 --> 0:13:48,360
 If you have some white or whitish walls that you can throw the light up on and then it

150
0:13:48,360 --> 0:13:52,760
 comes back, that really makes a big difference.

151
0:13:52,840 --> 0:13:58,200
 I tried buying one of them famous ring lights because they're so fancy, right?

152
0:13:58,200 --> 0:14:03,640
 But I have glasses and if you have glasses and you're sitting in front of a ring light,

153
0:14:03,640 --> 0:14:07,720
 you have ring light in your glasses and that doesn't really look that good on videos.

154
0:14:07,720 --> 0:14:13,000
 Actually, you can see it in the, it's also reflected in the eyes of people that have

155
0:14:13,000 --> 0:14:17,480
 ring lights, you can see it inside the irises.

156
0:14:17,480 --> 0:14:23,400
 So I still have the ring light but now it's mounted under the ceiling and it's also pointing

157
0:14:23,400 --> 0:14:31,080
 away from me so it's creating ambient light instead of shining directly in my eyes.

158
0:14:31,080 --> 0:14:35,480
 So that's the setup.

159
0:14:35,480 --> 0:14:45,640
 I also bought a low noise mouse and keyboard because I found out at some point that when

160
0:14:45,640 --> 0:14:50,680
 I was sitting doing things and setting things up and I needed to type, all that typing,

161
0:14:50,680 --> 0:14:57,640
 especially with the microphone so close to the keyboard, that was sort of annoying.

162
0:14:57,640 --> 0:15:03,720
 But basically, I would say get a decent webcam, get a second monitor so you have at least

163
0:15:03,720 --> 0:15:06,080
 two.

164
0:15:06,080 --> 0:15:12,840
 And you can see here, this is my green screen setup so this image is looking the other way.

165
0:15:12,840 --> 0:15:24,680
 My office is not very big and I have my bag up to what you call a cabinet with glassware.

166
0:15:24,680 --> 0:15:30,280
 It's brown, it's not very pretty, it showed on some of my first webinar videos.

167
0:15:30,280 --> 0:15:36,720
 Then I got a white roller blind that I mounted in the ceiling so I could roll that down when

168
0:15:36,720 --> 0:15:41,560
 I was doing videos and I could pull it up again when I needed to go to the cupboard

169
0:15:41,560 --> 0:15:51,400
 behind me and now I've upgraded that so now I have mounted just basically a piece of vibrant

170
0:15:51,400 --> 0:15:59,000
 green sheet on the roller blind, fastened with magnets so it's easy to remove, and that's

171
0:15:59,000 --> 0:16:00,980
 my green screen.

172
0:16:00,980 --> 0:16:04,280
 And that's working really, really well.

173
0:16:04,320 --> 0:16:13,640
 So that's like a super cheap setup to get a green screen so you can remove your background,

174
0:16:13,640 --> 0:16:16,320
 put yourself in any background you want.

175
0:16:16,320 --> 0:16:22,920
 Even when I'm doing, I do a lot of Zoom meetings and Zoom also has all these virtual backgrounds

176
0:16:22,920 --> 0:16:29,080
 things, but you can really, really see if people, I'm sure you have had meetings with

177
0:16:29,160 --> 0:16:34,840
 people that are using virtual background and are not sitting on like a uniform background

178
0:16:34,840 --> 0:16:39,840
 then if they have a headset on, sometimes the headset disappears, sometimes their ears

179
0:16:39,840 --> 0:16:45,240
 disappear, sometimes their arms disappear, if you're using a green screen and you tell

180
0:16:45,240 --> 0:16:50,920
 Zoom that you actually have a green screen, it is working much, much better.

181
0:16:50,920 --> 0:16:57,140
 So you won't be as fussy as the usual virtual background function.

182
0:16:57,140 --> 0:16:58,680
 So I really like that.

183
0:16:58,680 --> 0:17:01,600
 It has upped my game a lot.

184
0:17:02,600 --> 0:17:03,600
 Cheers.

185
0:17:10,200 --> 0:17:11,200
 Yeah.

186
0:17:11,200 --> 0:17:13,200
 I think that was the last slide.

187
0:17:13,200 --> 0:17:14,680
 Yes, it was.

188
0:17:14,680 --> 0:17:15,680
 Good.

189
0:17:15,680 --> 0:17:20,600
 So, OBS, open broadcaster software.

190
0:17:20,600 --> 0:17:24,480
 It's open source, so it's free.

191
0:17:24,480 --> 0:17:26,800
 It's running on Windows, Mac, Linux.

192
0:17:26,800 --> 0:17:31,320
 I'm on a Linux machine.

193
0:17:31,320 --> 0:17:34,920
 And it runs really, really well.

194
0:17:34,920 --> 0:17:42,660
 It also has a built-in virtual webcam function.

195
0:17:42,660 --> 0:17:49,920
 So like if you're using some program where you need to put in your webcam that, for instance,

196
0:17:50,040 --> 0:17:56,240
 the software I use for, I use this really, it's a nice software to do webinars in called

197
0:17:56,240 --> 0:18:00,920
 Webinar Jam, but their customer support is like really, really crappy, so I can't really

198
0:18:00,920 --> 0:18:02,440
 recommend them.

199
0:18:02,440 --> 0:18:07,520
 But I signed up so long ago that I'm like grandfathered into the big plan forever.

200
0:18:07,520 --> 0:18:10,600
 So hey, it works.

201
0:18:10,600 --> 0:18:16,480
 And I like to use it, but I don't really recommend it.

202
0:18:16,480 --> 0:18:18,760
 But they don't have a streaming function.

203
0:18:18,760 --> 0:18:26,600
 I can't get a stream key for them and say I just want to stream my OBS feed into Webinar

204
0:18:26,600 --> 0:18:27,600
 Jam.

205
0:18:27,600 --> 0:18:29,240
 I have to use my webcam.

206
0:18:29,240 --> 0:18:34,960
 And can of course do slides and webcam stuff, but now they have sort of a virtual background

207
0:18:34,960 --> 0:18:37,800
 function for the webcam, but it's not very good.

208
0:18:37,800 --> 0:18:44,160
 So I'm like I would much rather just take my OBS feed, put that into Webinar Jam, or

209
0:18:44,160 --> 0:18:47,520
 whatever else service I'm using.

210
0:18:47,520 --> 0:18:55,480
 And now there's a virtual webcam function in OBS, so I can just tell Webinar Jam to

211
0:18:55,480 --> 0:18:57,840
 use my virtual webcam.

212
0:18:57,840 --> 0:19:02,280
 That's not super, there's sometimes a bit of a delay, so it's not necessarily super

213
0:19:02,280 --> 0:19:03,920
 good for Zoom meetings.

214
0:19:03,920 --> 0:19:06,480
 You can do it.

215
0:19:06,480 --> 0:19:14,780
 But those realtime meetings, maybe not always the good solution, but it can be done.

216
0:19:14,820 --> 0:19:20,500
 But it works super well for webinars, and that makes it a lot easier.

217
0:19:20,500 --> 0:19:25,380
 And I don't have to use all the controls in the webinar program to switch between slides

218
0:19:25,380 --> 0:19:32,500
 and webcam, and I just do everything in OBS as I used to do, and I can even make the local

219
0:19:32,500 --> 0:19:37,580
 recording in OBS as well to get the high quality recording that I want.

220
0:19:37,580 --> 0:19:40,060
 So I love OBS.

221
0:19:40,060 --> 0:19:46,060
 It's like one of my absolutely favorite tools.

222
0:19:46,060 --> 0:19:49,500
 So what does it look like?

223
0:19:49,500 --> 0:19:57,740
 I do run a slightly old version on my laptop for some reason.

224
0:19:57,740 --> 0:20:03,580
 So it might look slightly different if you go and install a new version now.

225
0:20:03,580 --> 0:20:09,100
 I just only realized a few days ago, and then I didn't want to rock the boat by running

226
0:20:09,100 --> 0:20:11,940
 a big upgrade.

227
0:20:11,940 --> 0:20:13,980
 But the principles are the same.

228
0:20:13,980 --> 0:20:19,620
 What we have here is you can put it in, down here I have studio mode.

229
0:20:19,620 --> 0:20:24,300
 This is what we have here where we have like a preview screen and a program screen.

230
0:20:24,300 --> 0:20:29,580
 Actually those of you that can see the setup up here where we're using the black magic

231
0:20:29,580 --> 0:20:32,120
 box, it has the same principle.

232
0:20:32,120 --> 0:20:38,740
 You have program, that is what we are streaming live or showing or recording.

233
0:20:39,380 --> 0:20:46,740
 Preview is what we will, if we click the transit button, get instead of what we are recording

234
0:20:46,740 --> 0:20:48,180
 or streaming now.

235
0:20:48,180 --> 0:20:55,420
 So that's like the main setup that we have these two scenes that we're looking at.

236
0:20:55,420 --> 0:20:59,940
 And a scene in OBS is like a combination of sources.

237
0:20:59,940 --> 0:21:03,920
 So you can have a number of scenes that you're switching between.

238
0:21:03,920 --> 0:21:06,660
 This scene I have right here.

239
0:21:06,660 --> 0:21:08,100
 And this is if it's in studio mode.

240
0:21:08,100 --> 0:21:11,780
 I can also just say I'm only doing like one scene.

241
0:21:11,780 --> 0:21:13,380
 I don't want the studio mode thing.

242
0:21:13,380 --> 0:21:21,340
 But I really like that I can have usually what I'm doing is I have one scene that is

243
0:21:21,340 --> 0:21:30,540
 just me on webcam, maybe with a background image of like I have a starting slide or something

244
0:21:30,540 --> 0:21:33,420
 like that or title slide.

245
0:21:33,420 --> 0:21:35,720
 So I have that as the background.

246
0:21:35,720 --> 0:21:43,080
 And then I switch to me with screen share and the webcam.

247
0:21:43,080 --> 0:21:46,120
 And of course at home I have the green screen.

248
0:21:46,120 --> 0:21:51,120
 So what we have here is we put in the scene.

249
0:21:51,120 --> 0:21:52,240
 So we have a scene.

250
0:21:52,240 --> 0:21:59,100
 And we can rename that to something that makes sense.

251
0:21:59,100 --> 0:22:02,640
 So we could call this one.

252
0:22:02,640 --> 0:22:04,040
 That didn't really work.

253
0:22:04,040 --> 0:22:05,040
 Yes.

254
0:22:05,240 --> 0:22:06,240
 Yes, it did work.

255
0:22:06,240 --> 0:22:07,240
 Okay.

256
0:22:07,240 --> 0:22:17,120
 So we call this webcam and screen.

257
0:22:17,120 --> 0:22:21,960
 So that's one scene.

258
0:22:21,960 --> 0:22:25,440
 And I can have here I have now I have adjusted some resolution.

259
0:22:25,440 --> 0:22:30,200
 So I have to like if I can do this.

260
0:22:30,200 --> 0:22:41,240
 I'm moving that one too.

261
0:22:41,240 --> 0:22:44,120
 This is a lot easier with a real mouse, you know.

262
0:22:56,440 --> 0:22:59,480
 There we go.

263
0:22:59,480 --> 0:23:04,640
 And now I move the video capture device somewhere else.

264
0:23:04,640 --> 0:23:07,200
 I need to grab that and drag it back in.

265
0:23:09,200 --> 0:23:11,200
 There it goes.

266
0:23:11,200 --> 0:23:12,200
 There.

267
0:23:12,200 --> 0:23:14,200
 So I can put myself in the corner here.

268
0:23:14,200 --> 0:23:16,200
 Here it goes.

269
0:23:16,200 --> 0:23:17,200
 Yes.

270
0:23:17,200 --> 0:23:23,120
 So that is like we have a screen with screen share and the webcam.

271
0:23:23,160 --> 0:23:26,880
 That would be a quite usual setup for me.

272
0:23:26,880 --> 0:23:34,200
 I could also put in my logo and some text at the bottom if I wanted to do that.

273
0:23:34,200 --> 0:23:42,800
 Then if I say, hey, I want to have another screen that is just me on the webcam, maybe,

274
0:23:42,800 --> 0:23:44,920
 then I go and say here I can add a scene.

275
0:23:44,920 --> 0:23:49,160
 There's a little plus down here.

276
0:23:49,200 --> 0:23:53,840
 So I add a scene and then we call that just webcam.

277
0:23:53,840 --> 0:23:56,480
 And it's a really good idea.

278
0:23:56,480 --> 0:23:59,640
 Tiny piece of advice.

279
0:23:59,640 --> 0:24:04,120
 Label your scenes in a sane way.

280
0:24:04,120 --> 0:24:09,360
 Because like three years later when you're running still on the same setup and you have

281
0:24:09,360 --> 0:24:16,040
 like 20 different scenes and they are all labeled something weird, it makes it a bit

282
0:24:16,120 --> 0:24:24,120
 hard to go in and see what is actually the two scenes I need to use today.

283
0:24:24,120 --> 0:24:27,840
 That will of course never happen to you, but that happened to me.

284
0:24:27,840 --> 0:24:29,680
 So label it.

285
0:24:29,680 --> 0:24:33,400
 Then we have to go here and see now it says here we don't have any sources.

286
0:24:33,400 --> 0:24:34,720
 Yes, I know.

287
0:24:34,720 --> 0:24:38,600
 So I go and add a source.

288
0:24:38,600 --> 0:24:47,160
 And I say I want, since this one was supposed to be webcam only, I go and add a video capture

289
0:24:47,160 --> 0:24:51,240
 device.

290
0:24:51,240 --> 0:25:00,360
 And since I already have an input device for my built-in webcam, I just go and say I want

291
0:25:00,360 --> 0:25:01,560
 to add this one.

292
0:25:01,560 --> 0:25:06,920
 So I click add existing and then I can take this one and I can say okay.

293
0:25:06,920 --> 0:25:10,160
 So now I have the webcam.

294
0:25:10,160 --> 0:25:19,380
 Then we can say and it's 4 by 3, it's not 16.9.

295
0:25:19,380 --> 0:25:24,280
 So I can go and right click this one.

296
0:25:24,280 --> 0:25:27,240
 And we can say settings, properties.

297
0:25:27,240 --> 0:25:32,000
 I'm going to show you how to do the green screen as well in a moment.

298
0:25:32,000 --> 0:25:43,500
 So I have here, I can see what's the device, it's input one, what's the video format, resolution.

299
0:25:43,500 --> 0:25:50,060
 Then I can say hey, can this actually do, it can do 1280 by 720.

300
0:25:50,060 --> 0:25:55,520
 So that's at least 16.9, that was what I wanted.

301
0:25:55,520 --> 0:26:00,160
 I can change the frame rate.

302
0:26:00,160 --> 0:26:09,600
 So it can only do a frame rate of 10 if I set the resolution to 720, so that's maybe

303
0:26:09,600 --> 0:26:13,500
 not so impressive.

304
0:26:13,500 --> 0:26:18,960
 And there's also something about color range.

305
0:26:18,960 --> 0:26:24,200
 This is also where you can experiment with if your color settings are not correct, if

306
0:26:24,200 --> 0:26:28,760
 you need it to zoom in or something like that.

307
0:26:28,760 --> 0:26:35,920
 You set that here under setting for the camera.

308
0:26:35,920 --> 0:26:40,200
 You have all these settings here and set the power line frequency to 50 and stuff like

309
0:26:40,200 --> 0:26:44,000
 that.

310
0:26:44,000 --> 0:26:53,400
 So you have all the controls for your webcam inside OBS as well.

311
0:26:54,240 --> 0:27:00,640
 Now we change the resolution, so now it got way too big.

312
0:27:00,640 --> 0:27:10,920
 That was not what I tried to do.

313
0:27:10,920 --> 0:27:25,880
 So we just need it to fit here, so that goes fits.

314
0:27:25,880 --> 0:27:37,480
 So if this was at home and I was using my green screen, then I would also add the filter,

315
0:27:37,480 --> 0:27:40,160
 because green screen, that lives in filters.

316
0:27:40,160 --> 0:27:44,440
 So I go down here to the bottom and I pick filters.

317
0:27:44,440 --> 0:27:58,680
 And then I can say I want to add an effect filter if I could get to the bottom of this.

318
0:27:58,680 --> 0:28:01,680
 My screen is too small.

319
0:28:02,680 --> 0:28:05,680
 How do I do that?

320
0:28:12,680 --> 0:28:15,680
 Now that's a good question.

321
0:28:25,680 --> 0:28:27,680
 There it goes.

322
0:28:27,680 --> 0:28:31,840
 So here I have the effect filters and I want to add that.

323
0:28:31,840 --> 0:28:35,240
 And I have what's called a chroma key.

324
0:28:35,240 --> 0:28:38,360
 And that is the chroma, that's something with color.

325
0:28:38,360 --> 0:28:45,200
 So we need to fill that out and call this one green screen.

326
0:28:45,200 --> 0:28:50,560
 So I can remember what it is.

327
0:28:50,560 --> 0:28:55,520
 And then I can choose what type of screen I'm sitting with.

328
0:28:55,520 --> 0:29:00,880
 Do I have a green, blue, magenta or custom color?

329
0:29:00,880 --> 0:29:09,000
 Sometimes you need to say custom and then give it a slightly, if your green screen is

330
0:29:09,000 --> 0:29:17,720
 a different shade of gray, or not gray green, you might have to tell it exactly what color

331
0:29:17,720 --> 0:29:21,080
 green your green screen is.

332
0:29:21,080 --> 0:29:26,200
 But otherwise just go with green and then you can experiment with these.

333
0:29:26,200 --> 0:29:30,880
 So now there's like nothing green behind me.

334
0:29:30,880 --> 0:29:31,880
 So it isn't working.

335
0:29:31,880 --> 0:29:40,720
 But what you need to do is you need to experiment a bit with similarities, smoothness and spill

336
0:29:40,720 --> 0:29:48,520
 reduction to make it fit your setup with your webcam, your lightning, the exact color of

337
0:29:48,520 --> 0:29:51,000
 your green screen.

338
0:29:51,000 --> 0:30:01,440
 So that it actually removes the background but it doesn't remove all of you or you don't

339
0:30:01,440 --> 0:30:03,920
 get green hair unless you have that already.

340
0:30:03,920 --> 0:30:08,240
 If you have green hair already, green screen is a really bad idea.

341
0:30:08,240 --> 0:30:14,320
 Also don't wear green clothes.

342
0:30:14,320 --> 0:30:19,600
 Don't wear a multicolored scarf with green stuff.

343
0:30:19,640 --> 0:30:26,640
 I've had issues when I've been wearing this old born hack or born hack t-shirts with the

344
0:30:26,640 --> 0:30:29,520
 green logo on them.

345
0:30:29,520 --> 0:30:36,840
 Then you can see it's a minor detail but then you'll suddenly see then you become transparent

346
0:30:36,840 --> 0:30:43,080
 where the logo is and you can see the back, what it was behind you in the layers here

347
0:30:43,160 --> 0:30:49,840
 on the screen that they will appear through whatever green clothing you have on.

348
0:30:49,840 --> 0:30:58,320
 I still haven't, I need to get like a long-sleeved green roller neck sweater to play around with.

349
0:30:58,320 --> 0:31:01,720
 I haven't gotten to that but I think that would be fun.

350
0:31:01,720 --> 0:31:04,560
 So you could be a talking head as well.

351
0:31:04,560 --> 0:31:11,080
 Exactly, then I can become totally a talking head in the middle of the screen and also

352
0:31:11,120 --> 0:31:14,440
 need some green gloves.

353
0:31:14,440 --> 0:31:22,440
 I had an issue once where I did a webinar where I needed to talk about, that was on

354
0:31:22,440 --> 0:31:27,040
 horse training, where I needed to talk about comfort zone or zone of development or zone

355
0:31:27,040 --> 0:31:28,360
 of danger.

356
0:31:28,360 --> 0:31:35,440
 So where you are, are you comfortable or are you, it's a bit exciting or a bit too interesting

357
0:31:35,440 --> 0:31:38,760
 but it's still okay or is it feeling really dangerous?

358
0:31:38,760 --> 0:31:43,560
 I had three pieces of paper, a green, a yellow and a red.

359
0:31:43,560 --> 0:31:47,800
 And whenever I hold up the green piece of paper it just disappeared and showed the background

360
0:31:47,800 --> 0:31:50,800
 and I was like, oh I need to do something else about this.

361
0:31:50,800 --> 0:31:57,680
 I had to figure out a way to actually, I think I found a very different shade of green paper

362
0:31:57,680 --> 0:32:04,720
 and then it kind of worked but you have to think about what you're doing when you're

363
0:32:05,040 --> 0:32:11,040
 using green screen like this because it actually filters out anything green.

364
0:32:11,040 --> 0:32:18,040
 So that will give some interesting effects sometimes.

365
0:32:18,040 --> 0:32:22,120
 But it is pretty easy to just put this in.

366
0:32:22,120 --> 0:32:32,120
 Also if I wanted to have maybe that, okay now I wanted to be used the 16.9 and not the

367
0:32:32,320 --> 0:32:37,000
 3 output of my webcam but I want to just cut a wee bit off in the sides.

368
0:32:37,000 --> 0:32:43,120
 I could put in another filter as well.

369
0:32:43,120 --> 0:32:49,520
 I think, yeah, that's like a crop.

370
0:32:49,520 --> 0:32:56,960
 So I could say like, we just call that crop, whatever.

371
0:32:56,960 --> 0:33:03,480
 And then I can say, okay, so on the left I want to crop 100 pixels.

372
0:33:03,480 --> 0:33:09,880
 And on the right I want to crop 100 pixels, there it goes.

373
0:33:09,880 --> 0:33:13,040
 If I for some reason wanted to do that.

374
0:33:13,040 --> 0:33:17,320
 So now my input is smaller and then maybe I want to turn it to the side, maybe I want

375
0:33:17,320 --> 0:33:19,120
 to put it in the middle, whatever.

376
0:33:19,120 --> 0:33:28,080
 But I have put like a bit of cropping on the sides without altering the input format.

377
0:33:28,080 --> 0:33:29,360
 So that can also be helpful.

378
0:33:29,360 --> 0:33:36,600
 That can also be helpful if you have your webcam put in a position where it, of course,

379
0:33:36,600 --> 0:33:41,960
 if you need the entire width of the webcam, that's not a good solution, but if you have

380
0:33:41,960 --> 0:33:48,200
 a corner that will always be shown on your webcam where your green screen isn't covering

381
0:33:48,240 --> 0:33:53,000
 or something like that, you can just crop that out without actually having to alter

382
0:33:53,000 --> 0:33:58,480
 the resolution.

383
0:33:58,480 --> 0:34:04,480
 So now if I say I have this, I want to now do my live presentation or something like

384
0:34:04,480 --> 0:34:09,840
 that, then I'll have to set up some streaming.

385
0:34:09,880 --> 0:34:16,880
 And I do that by going here to tools, I think.

386
0:34:16,880 --> 0:34:17,880
 Nope.

387
0:34:17,880 --> 0:34:18,880
 Settings.

388
0:34:18,880 --> 0:34:25,760
 Here, under file we have settings.

389
0:34:25,760 --> 0:34:35,320
 And then I have like, there's like a ton of settings and it's, you basically start with

390
0:34:35,320 --> 0:34:38,480
 the default settings and then see where that takes you.

391
0:34:38,480 --> 0:34:43,440
 One of the things I really, really also like about using OBS, that is, because it's open

392
0:34:43,440 --> 0:34:51,680
 source, it has so many users and there's like a ton of videos on YouTube about using OBS.

393
0:34:51,680 --> 0:34:58,000
 So if you find a function and you're a bit like, hmm, how should I do that, go Google,

394
0:34:58,000 --> 0:35:03,880
 find a video on YouTube, see what people say, check out a different couple of videos to

395
0:35:03,920 --> 0:35:08,960
 see who is saying something sensible.

396
0:35:08,960 --> 0:35:16,160
 Because it's usually very easy to find information on whatever it is you need.

397
0:35:16,160 --> 0:35:20,720
 That also means if you have some sort of issue, there's someone, probably someone who already

398
0:35:20,720 --> 0:35:25,400
 had that, if you have an issue with a specific webcam that isn't working or something like

399
0:35:25,400 --> 0:35:31,760
 that, there's a good chance that someone else has already had that problem and have solved

400
0:35:31,760 --> 0:35:32,760
 it.

401
0:35:33,520 --> 0:35:37,920
 I really like that.

402
0:35:37,920 --> 0:35:43,200
 And also because it is a program that is widely used, there's a lot of development going on,

403
0:35:43,200 --> 0:35:46,460
 so there's continuously coming new versions.

404
0:35:46,460 --> 0:35:51,120
 But what we wanted to look at is, we might look at the output first.

405
0:35:51,120 --> 0:35:55,360
 Because if I want to do a recording, I want to make sure that I'm actually recording in

406
0:35:55,360 --> 0:35:59,280
 the format that I would like.

407
0:35:59,320 --> 0:36:07,280
 So I say, yes, we want the encoder to be 264, that makes sense.

408
0:36:07,280 --> 0:36:11,140
 Something about the audio bit rate, that's probably okay.

409
0:36:11,140 --> 0:36:21,920
 We can turn on some advanced encoder settings, but usually that's not necessary.

410
0:36:21,920 --> 0:36:25,280
 And we can say, what is the recording quality?

411
0:36:25,280 --> 0:36:34,160
 Stream a stream, that's usually recommended, because if the computer needs to both create

412
0:36:34,160 --> 0:36:40,200
 a stream in one resolution and a video output in another resolution, it has to work harder.

413
0:36:40,200 --> 0:36:43,880
 If you have a big computer with a lot of resources, that's not a problem.

414
0:36:43,880 --> 0:36:56,080
 If you're working on a laptop, then maybe you need to do that.

415
0:36:56,080 --> 0:37:01,120
 Actually it says here, recordings cannot be paused if the recording quality is set to

416
0:37:01,120 --> 0:37:02,120
 same stream.

417
0:37:02,120 --> 0:37:03,520
 Yeah, that kind of makes sense.

418
0:37:03,520 --> 0:37:08,880
 There is now, there wasn't when I started, but now there is a pause function, so if you're

419
0:37:08,920 --> 0:37:16,680
 doing something and then you hit a snack and you need to investigate something, that happens

420
0:37:16,680 --> 0:37:20,120
 a lot when I do videos.

421
0:37:20,120 --> 0:37:25,400
 It's like when you sit with a live piece of software and you demo that, there might be

422
0:37:25,400 --> 0:37:27,840
 something weird going on sometimes.

423
0:37:27,840 --> 0:37:34,200
 So sometimes if I'm like five minutes into a video and I've been demoing some new feature

424
0:37:35,200 --> 0:37:40,440
 and then something unexpected happens, what I do instead of having to start over is I

425
0:37:40,440 --> 0:37:45,200
 say just a second, I'll investigate this and then I hit the pause button, that's if I'm

426
0:37:45,200 --> 0:37:52,120
 not live, then I hit the pause button and then I can go investigate and figure out have

427
0:37:52,120 --> 0:37:58,800
 I misunderstood this feature, do we have a bug, is this doing what it's actually supposed

428
0:37:58,800 --> 0:38:03,160
 to do, did I just click something wrong, what happened?

429
0:38:03,160 --> 0:38:07,600
 And then I can go back to OBS and my screen share and I can pick up where I left and

430
0:38:07,600 --> 0:38:15,120
 I can say okay, so what we need to do is this, this, this, instead of having to restart the

431
0:38:15,120 --> 0:38:21,400
 recording and start from the beginning.

432
0:38:21,400 --> 0:38:34,960
 So recording format, it defaults to Matroska which usually works really, really well.

433
0:38:34,960 --> 0:38:41,000
 There's also audio settings, video settings.

434
0:38:41,000 --> 0:38:46,360
 So we have like the canvas resolution and then we have the output resolution.

435
0:38:46,360 --> 0:38:52,760
 So the canvas resolution, that's what we are working on in the program or preview and

436
0:38:52,760 --> 0:38:59,680
 then we have the output scale resolution and we need to have the, you can see here like

437
0:38:59,680 --> 0:39:08,040
 the aspect ratio on the canvas is 1600 to 899, that's like as close to 16.9 as you'll

438
0:39:08,040 --> 0:39:11,960
 get, right?

439
0:39:12,000 --> 0:39:18,840
 I'm not really sure what happened to the last pixel here since it's not 1600 by 900 but

440
0:39:18,840 --> 0:39:30,360
 hey, yeah, we have a question there, can you hand him to me?

441
0:39:30,360 --> 0:39:36,240
 Then I'll just grab a bit of water and I need to hurry up.

442
0:39:36,240 --> 0:39:41,560
 What's the point of having a canvas bigger than what we are going to actually output

443
0:39:41,560 --> 0:39:45,640
 because scaling might get lost?

444
0:39:45,640 --> 0:39:48,120
 Yeah, you are absolutely right.

445
0:39:48,120 --> 0:39:52,520
 Usually I would also, I'm not quite sure why it has default to the 1600, I would usually

446
0:39:52,520 --> 0:40:03,800
 make those the same because it's annoying and I would usually set this to 1080 for output

447
0:40:03,880 --> 0:40:09,840
 because then I get like the maximum quality on my videos.

448
0:40:09,840 --> 0:40:17,240
 One of the things you need to be aware of if you are screen sharing is that if you are

449
0:40:17,240 --> 0:40:25,480
 using like 1080 and people are maybe watching it on their phones or on a smaller screen

450
0:40:25,480 --> 0:40:30,160
 size then things will become rather tiny where they are looking like nice and sharp on your

451
0:40:30,160 --> 0:40:32,120
 big screen.

452
0:40:32,120 --> 0:40:37,240
 Then you can in your browser when you are visiting any page, I have like a really crappy

453
0:40:37,240 --> 0:40:43,240
 resolution here, but if you are on a page that you want to screen share and you are

454
0:40:43,240 --> 0:40:47,960
 working in a high resolution and you want your audience to have a chance to actually

455
0:40:47,960 --> 0:40:54,680
 pick up on what you are doing you can use control and plus and I usually run on 125

456
0:40:54,680 --> 0:41:00,480
 percent zoom because that actually makes it a lot easier for my audience to see what's

457
0:41:00,480 --> 0:41:06,280
 going on if they are sitting on a smaller screen than me and I can keep the high resolution

458
0:41:06,280 --> 0:41:10,400
 quality on the videos, on the webcam, on everything.

459
0:41:10,400 --> 0:41:11,760
 I kind of like that.

460
0:41:11,760 --> 0:41:15,040
 Yeah, we have another question there.

461
0:41:15,040 --> 0:41:20,680
 So this is also regarding the base canvas resolution and the output scaled resolution.

462
0:41:20,680 --> 0:41:24,760
 So for example I am doing a broadcast or recording on my computer but my computer has

463
0:41:24,760 --> 0:41:32,200
 a 4K screen, here is where I can choose what people see is just 1080p and it does the downscaling.

464
0:41:32,200 --> 0:41:39,640
 And I saw there is also a recording option and the recording is also the downscaled version.

465
0:41:39,640 --> 0:41:42,640
 Thank you.

466
0:41:42,640 --> 0:41:49,340
 And that's a good point and also if you are using background images it's a really good

467
0:41:49,340 --> 0:41:55,660
 idea that whatever background image you are using is actually your canvas size.

468
0:41:55,660 --> 0:42:02,140
 So if I have a 1600 by 900 canvas size I should make my background images that size because

469
0:42:02,140 --> 0:42:07,660
 then I don't have to scale them then I will get a better quality.

470
0:42:07,660 --> 0:42:10,980
 So that's good to keep in mind.

471
0:42:10,980 --> 0:42:16,300
 The last thing I wanted to show you before we have time for a few questions more that's

472
0:42:16,300 --> 0:42:22,740
 like the stream, you just go to the stream here and then you choose whatever service

473
0:42:22,740 --> 0:42:23,740
 it is.

474
0:42:23,740 --> 0:42:27,460
 They have some predefined sources you can use.

475
0:42:27,460 --> 0:42:34,420
 I found out that choosing Facebook live actually doesn't work.

476
0:42:34,420 --> 0:42:42,100
 I usually need to say custom, not Twitch, custom, there it goes.

477
0:42:42,100 --> 0:42:48,340
 And then from my Facebook it tells me the server and it tells me the stream key.

478
0:42:48,340 --> 0:42:54,980
 And in Facebook I can set up so that I have for the same Facebook page I have a recurring

479
0:42:54,980 --> 0:43:00,340
 stream key so I don't have to go into OBS every time and change the stream key.

480
0:43:00,340 --> 0:43:03,060
 That is of course less secure.

481
0:43:03,060 --> 0:43:08,940
 If someone should obtain my stream key they can now stream to my Facebook groups but the

482
0:43:08,980 --> 0:43:14,940
 The risk of that happening is not enormous and if it happens I can go and reset my stream

483
0:43:14,940 --> 0:43:21,180
 key but you of course need to be aware that that's the risk of reusing stream keys but

484
0:43:21,180 --> 0:43:26,700
 it's a lot easier that you don't have to go into OBS every time and paste in the new stream

485
0:43:26,700 --> 0:43:30,820
 key when you're going live.

486
0:43:30,860 --> 0:43:39,620
 There's also you can program hot keys and there's other settings.

487
0:43:39,620 --> 0:43:50,340
 But basically this is OBS, this is my Swiss army knife for video production.

488
0:43:50,340 --> 0:43:51,580
 I love working in it.

489
0:43:51,580 --> 0:44:00,220
 It saves me, I have no idea over the last now four and a half years how many hours of

490
0:44:00,260 --> 0:44:03,020
 editing work this has saved me.

491
0:44:03,020 --> 0:44:09,100
 I just love that I can get an idea to a video, I can create the setup, usually it's only

492
0:44:09,100 --> 0:44:15,380
 like editing a small piece of text or something like that in the scenes I already have.

493
0:44:15,380 --> 0:44:20,100
 I sit down, I click record, I show whatever it is I want to show.

494
0:44:20,100 --> 0:44:24,940
 This could also be something to a client if I need to tell them how to set up something

495
0:44:24,940 --> 0:44:29,140
 specific in their Simplio account, I go into their Simplio account.

496
0:44:29,180 --> 0:44:33,820
 I do a short recording with OBS, I upload it to their account, I send them an email

497
0:44:33,820 --> 0:44:39,980
 and say hey here's the video and I don't need to do any after processing the Matroska video

498
0:44:39,980 --> 0:44:45,260
 is just ready to use as soon as I hit stop recording on OBS.

499
0:44:45,260 --> 0:44:47,300
 I love it, it's fantastic.

500
0:44:47,300 --> 0:44:49,900
 Yeah, any questions?

501
0:44:49,900 --> 0:45:07,500
 Hello again, so the question I have is I use, I personally use a fork of OBS but I'm considering

502
0:45:07,500 --> 0:45:12,460
 using OBS itself because it's well maintained.

503
0:45:12,460 --> 0:45:17,260
 The software I use is also an older version and I only have a single screen and you early

504
0:45:17,260 --> 0:45:21,420
 showed you have a studio mode and a single mode screen thingy.

505
0:45:21,420 --> 0:45:28,020
 Yeah, so studio mode is just switching between showing like two, both the preview and the

506
0:45:28,020 --> 0:45:31,780
 program or only having.

507
0:45:31,780 --> 0:45:37,580
 So mine looks like this and when you were doing your talk in studio mode I saw when

508
0:45:37,580 --> 0:45:44,180
 you were building scenes you can just play around in the scene adding sources and on

509
0:45:44,180 --> 0:45:51,740
 the right side for us that is what is live and then the left side is?

510
0:45:51,740 --> 0:45:55,420
 The left side is always preview and the right side is always live.

511
0:45:55,420 --> 0:45:58,220
 How do you push the preview to the live?

512
0:45:58,220 --> 0:46:02,700
 Then I just hit transition and then I switch to the new scene.

513
0:46:02,700 --> 0:46:07,500
 Because for example when I do a broadcast or at work I need to present something, sometimes

514
0:46:07,500 --> 0:46:12,860
 they ask something I need to pull in a terminal or maybe I need a scene with a terminal in

515
0:46:12,860 --> 0:46:13,860
 it.

516
0:46:13,860 --> 0:46:19,220
 But I was just wondering with this mode I can check for myself something first and then

517
0:46:19,220 --> 0:46:20,220
 push it to live?

518
0:46:20,220 --> 0:46:23,220
 And then press it to program.

519
0:46:23,220 --> 0:46:28,780
 Thank you.

520
0:46:28,780 --> 0:46:35,740
 And you said there were virtual webcams, is that you can designate pretty much the video

521
0:46:35,740 --> 0:46:41,660
 output of any app, of any window that is running on your machine.

522
0:46:41,660 --> 0:46:44,460
 You can designate that to be a virtual webcam?

523
0:46:44,460 --> 0:46:54,700
 Yes, because then whatever is running in program will then be shown on the virtual webcam.

524
0:46:54,700 --> 0:46:59,340
 It's a pretty cool feature, for a long while it was like a special plugin on Windows where

525
0:46:59,340 --> 0:47:05,140
 they had it on Linux where they had it on Windows and I also think Mac but now it's

526
0:47:05,140 --> 0:47:07,220
 built in from the beginning.

527
0:47:07,220 --> 0:47:18,220
 Hi, I've heard that the Linux version of OBS is more limited than the Windows version,

528
0:47:18,220 --> 0:47:20,260
 is that still the case?

529
0:47:20,260 --> 0:47:24,300
 I think so, yes.

530
0:47:24,300 --> 0:47:29,660
 One of the specific examples was the virtual webcam where you needed a special plugin that

531
0:47:29,660 --> 0:47:35,140
 someone else had created for the Linux version that is now built in.

532
0:47:35,140 --> 0:47:40,460
 And there are some other limitations but I've been running this on Linux for four and

533
0:47:40,460 --> 0:47:42,660
 a half years and I'm happy, happy.

534
0:47:42,660 --> 0:47:46,020
 You can't remember any other limitations?

535
0:47:46,020 --> 0:47:53,020
 No, no, I haven't met anything where I've been limited and then what usually happens

536
0:47:53,020 --> 0:47:57,300
 is if I find something and I start Googling and then they say hey there's this function

537
0:47:57,300 --> 0:48:02,100
 you blah blah and then I see oh okay so that's like a Windows function and then I Google

538
0:48:02,140 --> 0:48:07,180
 a bit more and then I find out okay so that's not available on Linux yet but it's so far

539
0:48:07,180 --> 0:48:12,180
 the only thing I've seen was the virtual webcam function.

540
0:48:12,180 --> 0:48:17,180
 Okay, thank you.

541
0:48:17,180 --> 0:48:21,300
 Hello again.

542
0:48:21,300 --> 0:48:25,580
 So as I said I do presentations at work, you know, Monday meetings but I'm considering

543
0:48:25,580 --> 0:48:26,580
 live streaming.

544
0:48:26,580 --> 0:48:27,580
 Yeah.

545
0:48:27,580 --> 0:48:30,740
 I'm not sure what I'm going to do yet.

546
0:48:30,940 --> 0:48:36,620
 In the settings you were scrolling through like the video and audio and I saw shortcuts.

547
0:48:36,620 --> 0:48:42,300
 When you're recording for yourself or doing a presentation, do you use any shortcuts for

548
0:48:42,300 --> 0:48:44,460
 like scene changing?

549
0:48:44,460 --> 0:48:45,460
 I do that.

550
0:48:45,460 --> 0:48:51,940
 If I use more than two or three scenes, I can put shortcuts on specific scenes so that

551
0:48:51,940 --> 0:48:57,380
 I know that if I hit F2 or something like that it will in the preview switch to a specific

552
0:48:57,460 --> 0:48:59,860
 scene so I don't have to scroll and look for it.

553
0:48:59,860 --> 0:49:06,460
 I can just hit a button that was also what we had on the video box set up here way back

554
0:49:06,460 --> 0:49:11,940
 when when we used OBS and that works really nicely because that's a big help if you have

555
0:49:11,940 --> 0:49:15,740
 many scenes you're switching between.

556
0:49:15,740 --> 0:49:22,420
 I'll assume that all the shortcuts are defaulted in the application and you don't need to add

557
0:49:22,420 --> 0:49:27,500
 yourself because when I was researching a week ago when I looked on YouTube to some

558
0:49:27,500 --> 0:49:34,300
 reviews about OBS, they all most of them suggested to get one of these devices with like multiple

559
0:49:34,300 --> 0:49:39,980
 buttons and so on but they're very pricey so I was wondering if everything is just doable

560
0:49:39,980 --> 0:49:43,660
 on just a regular keyboard with your computer or on the laptop.

561
0:49:43,660 --> 0:49:45,140
 I actually can't remember.

562
0:49:45,140 --> 0:49:48,820
 Yeah, see you have here like start streaming, stop streaming.

563
0:49:48,820 --> 0:49:52,620
 You have keys for that that you can put in.

564
0:49:52,620 --> 0:49:59,900
 I'm guessing then you just put in the key combination you want but there's also a way

565
0:49:59,900 --> 0:50:08,220
 to put key shortcuts on your specific scenes.

566
0:50:08,820 --> 0:50:26,340
 I just can't remember how.

567
0:50:26,340 --> 0:50:28,900
 I can't remember how you do that but there's a way to do it.

568
0:50:28,900 --> 0:50:32,020
 You can bind a shortcut to a specific scene.

569
0:50:32,020 --> 0:50:37,780
 Yeah, there's a way to do that but I just can't remember right now how you do that.

570
0:50:37,780 --> 0:50:41,940
 It's there.

571
0:50:41,940 --> 0:50:45,420
 Yeah.

572
0:50:45,420 --> 0:50:50,180
 The green screen function, does it have to be green or can you designate pretty much

573
0:50:50,180 --> 0:50:52,020
 any color to be black?

574
0:50:52,020 --> 0:50:57,300
 You can use other colors and you can tell OBS exactly what color you have.

575
0:50:57,300 --> 0:51:03,140
 Some colors work better than others and you also have to consider but like if your brand

576
0:51:03,180 --> 0:51:07,220
 colors are green and you're wearing a lot of green, you need to figure out another

577
0:51:07,220 --> 0:51:12,260
 color because otherwise everything will be very weird.

578
0:51:12,260 --> 0:51:13,780
 So you can do other colors.

579
0:51:13,780 --> 0:51:18,420
 Blue is another traditional color for, then it's blue screen instead of green screen.

580
0:51:18,420 --> 0:51:19,420
 That also works really well.

581
0:51:19,420 --> 0:51:23,500
 So it works better if it's a primary color.

582
0:51:23,500 --> 0:51:29,620
 Yeah, so you just need to and you can in the chroma key settings you can specify the color

583
0:51:29,700 --> 0:51:32,380
 of your green screen.

584
0:51:32,380 --> 0:51:33,780
 Yeah.

585
0:51:33,780 --> 0:51:36,780
 Any more questions?

586
0:51:36,780 --> 0:51:37,780
 No?

587
0:51:37,780 --> 0:51:44,340
 If you get any questions, then you're welcome to stop me on the street here and say hi or

588
0:51:44,340 --> 0:51:47,220
 send me an email or anything.

589
0:51:47,220 --> 0:51:51,140
 I'll be happy to answer your questions.

590
0:51:51,140 --> 0:51:54,140
 Please give a big round of applause to Mariette.

591
0:51:54,140 --> 0:51:55,140
 Thank you.

592
0:51:55,140 --> 0:51:56,420
 Thank you.
