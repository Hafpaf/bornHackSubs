0:00:00,000 --> 0:00:11,280
 Okay. We're about to begin the next presentation. We have Benjamin who is here to talk about

2
0:00:11,280 --> 0:00:15,920
 an introduction to digital consent, why a new definition with new tools and specifications

3
0:00:15,920 --> 0:00:24,080
 are needed. Let's give a round of applause for Benjamin.

4
0:00:24,080 --> 0:00:29,520
 Thank you so much. I have a quick sponsorship message before starting the talk, so I just

5
0:00:29,520 --> 0:00:36,840
 want to start with that so I don't forget it. A Danish organization called Django Denmark

6
0:00:36,840 --> 0:00:44,680
 is hosting Django Day, like an annual one-day event for Django people. It's in Copenhagen.

7
0:00:44,680 --> 0:00:52,760
 We found a really lovely venue on NÃ¸rrebro, and talks are coming in, and tickets are on

8
0:00:53,400 --> 0:01:00,560
 so on. That's on the 6th of October, and that's the website for that. So I hope that maybe

9
0:01:00,560 --> 0:01:12,160
 you're interested. There is also a little Django perspective in this talk. Yeah. So

10
0:01:12,160 --> 0:01:20,040
 I'm a software developer, and I want to talk about consent with the background that I have

11
0:01:20,520 --> 0:01:29,040
 as a software developer. Maybe I'm not so precise on the legal aspect, so this is not

12
0:01:29,040 --> 0:01:36,280
 like legal advice about how to do consent, but I hope it aligns with your understanding

13
0:01:36,280 --> 0:01:44,040
 of GDPR and those sorts of legal obligations that we have when we build systems with data,

14
0:01:44,800 --> 0:01:54,280
 basically. So it's also the first time in a long time that I'm doing a talk, and the

15
0:01:54,280 --> 0:02:02,280
 last time I was preparing a talk, I found out that I was very confused around what to

16
0:02:02,280 --> 0:02:14,560
 do, what focus to find. So now I ask why do I think this is a talk to present here for

17
0:02:14,560 --> 0:02:23,280
 you and for your sake, for my sake, and let's just make those terms clear. Let's make the

18
0:02:23,280 --> 0:02:30,960
 purpose of the talk clear. I really want more people to care about the question of

19
0:02:30,960 --> 0:02:39,480
 consent, digital consent, but in order so that we can build something and so that we

20
0:02:39,480 --> 0:02:43,840
 can build something together. So I'll try to, as a software developer, maintain the

21
0:02:43,840 --> 0:02:49,800
 aspect that we'll talk a lot about consent, but in the end, let's try to make it turn

22
0:02:49,840 --> 0:02:58,040
 it into a tool so that when we want to have consent for something in an application, we're

23
0:02:58,040 --> 0:03:12,040
 doing it the best possible way. So I hope you agree to that. Some of it is below the

24
0:03:12,280 --> 0:03:28,920
 falsehood. It's also Latin. So I'll try to cover these four aspects here. First, those

25
0:03:28,920 --> 0:03:37,960
 pesky cookie banners that we all know about. They're everywhere. And then I'll talk a bit

26
0:03:37,960 --> 0:03:46,720
 about consent, like what can we say, what sort of properties can we attach to consent

27
0:03:46,720 --> 0:03:55,480
 in order to have a definition of it. Then from that definition, can we specify something

28
0:03:55,480 --> 0:04:02,880
 that we can use to implement software? And then finally, I'll just share a little bit

29
0:04:02,920 --> 0:04:09,920
 about what I've been trying to do. I hope that people can hear, because it's very loud

30
0:04:09,920 --> 0:04:24,920
 for me up here with the rain. Okay, cool. So those pesky cookie banners, I'll just show

31
0:04:24,960 --> 0:04:33,960
 you a few examples to get the thought process started. What's happening right now with consent

32
0:04:33,960 --> 0:04:46,960
 is basically that people want to continue to use and share data. It's still okay. They

33
0:04:46,960 --> 0:04:53,960
 want to continue to use and share data the same way. Kind of business as usual, but we'll

34
0:04:54,000 --> 0:05:06,000
 just add even more layers of terms and conditions. And I've been annoyed at it and posted stuff

35
0:05:06,000 --> 0:05:12,000
 on social media when I saw a dialogue that I didn't like. And I was trying to figure

36
0:05:12,000 --> 0:05:19,000
 out some examples before the talk, and basically I just went to the first two kind of random

37
0:05:19,040 --> 0:05:25,040
 pages that I found. So these examples are not the cherry picks. I just went on the normal

38
0:05:25,040 --> 0:05:39,040
 internet and looked. I went to wordpress.com, and they say they're the world's most popular

39
0:05:39,080 --> 0:05:49,080
 website building tool. So let's hope they get consent right. I would say they don't.

40
0:05:49,080 --> 0:06:03,080
 You go to the front page, and there is no consent dialogue at all. But there is trackers.

41
0:06:03,120 --> 0:06:19,120
 There is trackers on the website. For the stream, people, I can say there is very heavy

42
0:06:19,120 --> 0:06:29,120
 rain coming down right now, so we have a lot of problems with the sound in here. I'll

43
0:06:29,160 --> 0:06:37,160
 let folks move a little bit. Yeah, okay. So people are just moving around in the room

44
0:06:37,160 --> 0:06:45,160
 here so that we can sit a little bit closer, and then we hope the rain will cool off.

45
0:06:59,160 --> 0:07:07,160
 That's a lot better. Okay.

46
0:07:21,160 --> 0:07:27,160
 So now the sound is better, and people are closer to the microphone. I guess we continue.

47
0:07:29,160 --> 0:07:35,160
 I went to the front page of wordpress.com, and there was no consent dialogue. I click

48
0:07:35,160 --> 0:07:41,160
 get started. I go to the second page, and then the consent dialogue pops up. I think

49
0:07:41,160 --> 0:07:47,160
 the designers of the website have decided that the consent dialogue is probably not

50
0:07:47,160 --> 0:07:53,160
 a good user experience, so they want to hide that on a secondary page. I looked at the

51
0:07:53,200 --> 0:08:03,200
 trackers, and they were the same on those two pages as far as I could tell. And then

52
0:08:03,200 --> 0:08:12,200
 of course they have this silly thing where you need to click customize, and then you

53
0:08:12,200 --> 0:08:19,200
 have to toggle something in order to actually reject it. That's a pattern of trying to make

54
0:08:19,240 --> 0:08:29,240
 people accept things. I have a different example here. That's when you go to Bloomberg.com.

55
0:08:33,240 --> 0:08:43,240
 It's a giant thing. You have to either accept all or reject all. What I thought was very

56
0:08:43,280 --> 0:08:53,280
 interesting about this one is a text that reads that you can actually manage those choices

57
0:08:55,280 --> 0:09:05,280
 any time, which I would understand that it's a good effect for this dialogue. You can

58
0:09:05,280 --> 0:09:11,280
 manage those choices any time you want, but that doesn't really make sense because if

59
0:09:11,320 --> 0:09:15,320
 I go to the website again with a different browser session, how am I going to manage

60
0:09:15,320 --> 0:09:22,320
 those choices from the previous visit? It's bizarre. The link just points to a generic

61
0:09:22,320 --> 0:09:32,320
 page that's dependent on the cookie. So that's one of those real absurdities of revoking

62
0:09:32,360 --> 0:09:42,360
 cookie consent. You may need to actually store those cookies yourself in order to revisit

63
0:09:42,360 --> 0:09:50,360
 the sites. You may also need to have a log of your own IP addresses you've been delegated

64
0:09:50,360 --> 0:09:58,360
 and whatever goes into your fingerprint that's used for this kind of ad profiling. Looking

65
0:09:58,400 --> 0:10:06,400
 at those terms and conditions, those consent dialogues, they all contain something about

66
0:10:07,400 --> 0:10:15,400
 profiling. So that's not profiling that is explicit, but it says that it may contain

67
0:10:15,400 --> 0:10:23,400
 this and this and this element. So in order to revoke it, I would pose that then the user

68
0:10:23,440 --> 0:10:29,440
 needs to be able to know that about their own web browsing in order to, for instance,

69
0:10:29,440 --> 0:10:39,440
 invoke the right to be forgotten or the right to see your own data. All those individual

70
0:10:39,440 --> 0:10:49,440
 GDPR rights. And that is absurd. I think no one's going to do that. Even on the highest

71
0:10:49,480 --> 0:11:01,480
 level. Knowing that and putting it into practice seems very far-fetched. So some other absurdities

72
0:11:03,480 --> 0:11:09,480
 that we notice is that there is actually a great HTTP header, the do not track header.

73
0:11:11,480 --> 0:11:17,480
 And it seems to me that it would be easier if the ones that own websites instead would

74
0:11:17,520 --> 0:11:23,520
 read that header instead of letting everyone have to read those awfully long terms and

75
0:11:23,520 --> 0:11:29,520
 conditions. That's just a very simple solution to not consent to tracking. And then if that

76
0:11:29,520 --> 0:11:34,520
 header is set, you don't even have to show those dialogues. You can give the user a better

77
0:11:34,520 --> 0:11:43,520
 experience. And then there's browser extensions kind of doing the same. Let's say you own

78
0:11:43,560 --> 0:11:49,560
 a website and you can see that people are using tracker bloggers or ad bloggers. That's

79
0:11:49,560 --> 0:11:52,560
 probably because they do not consent to the tracking, right? So you don't need to show

80
0:11:52,560 --> 0:11:59,560
 them the dialogue. And then there is the very strange behaviour of saying, like, if you

81
0:11:59,560 --> 0:12:05,560
 continue browsing this website, then you automatically agree. Like, how do you note that

82
0:12:05,560 --> 0:12:11,560
 someone actually saw that dialogue? And you might as well have missed it. That's the case

83
0:12:11,600 --> 0:12:17,600
 of the Bloomberg thing here. They have in the background there, you can see there is

84
0:12:17,600 --> 0:12:23,600
 a tiny, small, like, yellow thing that says that they have updated their terms and conditions.

85
0:12:23,600 --> 0:12:29,600
 And if you continue surfing the site, you just automatically agree to those changes.

86
0:12:29,600 --> 0:12:37,600
 Very strange, I would say. Okay. So let's be a little bit positive now.

87
0:12:37,640 --> 0:12:47,640
 I would say that there is maybe an okay thing to think about during the past, like, GDPR

88
0:12:47,640 --> 0:12:53,640
 times and maybe the past, I don't know, maybe it's a decade now that the cookie banners

89
0:12:53,640 --> 0:13:03,640
 have been out there. But they did spread an awareness of tracking and so on in the larger

90
0:13:03,680 --> 0:13:13,680
 population, right? And maybe that's an advantage. It could also be a disadvantage, though,

91
0:13:13,680 --> 0:13:20,680
 because we get this consent fatigue. We have to look at way too many things and consent

92
0:13:20,680 --> 0:13:28,680
 to them. So, of course, we just stop looking. We stop caring. And that's quite human.

93
0:13:33,680 --> 0:13:39,680
 Oh, this talk just keeps getting gloomier and gloomier.

94
0:13:39,680 --> 0:13:47,680
 So, the normalizing is part of the fatigue, you could say, but it's also part of maybe

95
0:13:47,680 --> 0:13:54,680
 saying, you know, oh, this tracking, it's innocent. Everyone does it. Like, it's completely

96
0:13:54,720 --> 0:14:02,720
 fine that we have a list of, I think, one of the consent, cookie consent frameworks.

97
0:14:02,720 --> 0:14:10,720
 They advertise that they automatically have an updated list of 2,000 third-party tracking

98
0:14:10,720 --> 0:14:18,720
 companies, data processors. It's quite a lot, but then that's kind of just normal.

99
0:14:18,760 --> 0:14:28,760
 And I think even worse is that we get a bit, like, nihilism is creeping in, like, big tech

100
0:14:28,760 --> 0:14:33,760
 is just doing whatever they want with our data, and we can't even read all these dialogues

101
0:14:33,760 --> 0:14:41,760
 that we keep getting thrown at us. But, yeah, good news. I think that cookie consent is

102
0:14:41,800 --> 0:14:51,800
 not really any consent thing. Maybe we should find a better word for it. It's very hard

103
0:14:51,800 --> 0:14:59,800
 to claim that this is informed consent. And we already can see how, like, very explicit

104
0:15:02,800 --> 0:15:09,800
 revocations of consent that are being indicated in HTTP headers are being ignored. And, yes,

105
0:15:09,840 --> 0:15:15,840
 I think I've argued the case that it's in practice, it's not possible to revoke this type of

106
0:15:15,840 --> 0:15:27,840
 consent. I asked a bit around, and I was happy to see that the general Born Hack audience

107
0:15:27,840 --> 0:15:35,840
 in the Fediverse also had a majority of saying, let's reject this as a solution to tracking.

108
0:15:35,880 --> 0:15:41,880
 Like, asking for consent in this way doesn't make tracking okay as how I would interpret

109
0:15:41,880 --> 0:15:52,880
 the response here. But also that some people have kind of given up hope. Some people also

110
0:15:52,880 --> 0:16:00,880
 believe that we can improve cookie banners so that the consent can work. I'd like to

111
0:16:00,920 --> 0:16:09,920
 really like to hear from them also. Let's say that we had a workshop and we could talk

112
0:16:09,920 --> 0:16:16,920
 a bit more about our experiences with both cookie consent but also other types of consent

113
0:16:16,920 --> 0:16:26,920
 where you agree to some terms and conditions in a shop or with a public sector. Then it

114
0:16:26,960 --> 0:16:32,960
 would be a great fit to ask these basic simple questions. Is the consent I'm dealing with

115
0:16:32,960 --> 0:16:40,960
 here, is it informed consent, meaning that the user knows what's going on, and how to

116
0:16:40,960 --> 0:16:47,960
 withdraw that. And also the curious case because often this legitimate interest is being mixed

117
0:16:47,960 --> 0:16:55,960
 up. Often there is a blurry line that it looks like you have to consent to something but

118
0:16:56,000 --> 0:17:04,000
 actually it's called legitimate interest. I'll try to come back to that. But that's

119
0:17:04,000 --> 0:17:14,000
 a great idea for a workshop, I think. I hope someone would be interested in that too.

120
0:17:14,040 --> 0:17:26,040
 So, moving on from the cookie banners, let's try to define something. Let's try to say

121
0:17:26,040 --> 0:17:36,040
 what properties should real consent contain. I don't know, strong consent, true consent.

122
0:17:36,080 --> 0:17:44,080
 Just trying to distance it from this mix up with the cookie banners. First of all,

123
0:17:44,080 --> 0:17:52,080
 real consent should be a voluntary thing. If there is only one button called accept

124
0:17:52,080 --> 0:18:00,080
 and you need to accept in order to access something, it's not consent. It's an agreement

125
0:18:00,120 --> 0:18:08,120
 or it's like the terms. But that's nothing to do with consent. We want the term to have

126
0:18:08,120 --> 0:18:16,120
 meaning. And that meaning comes when it's a voluntary declaration or agreement between

127
0:18:16,120 --> 0:18:23,120
 two parties. And secondly, it needs to be informed. So all this stuff about agreeing

128
0:18:23,360 --> 0:18:29,040
 without reading. We need to get into a situation where someone consenting to something actually

129
0:18:29,200 --> 0:18:36,200
 has an incentive to be informed about it. Then it should be revocable. That's also a

130
0:18:36,360 --> 0:18:44,360
 very hard technical task. So to implement that consent is suddenly being revoked, that

131
0:18:44,360 --> 0:18:48,640
 could happen any time to the system, needs to get a signal, needs to do something, needs

132
0:18:48,640 --> 0:18:55,120
 to scrub data, maybe tell other systems that they need to do the same. That can become

133
0:18:55,280 --> 0:19:01,800
 quite complicated. Then it needs to be manageable by the user. So what does that mean? That

134
0:19:01,800 --> 0:19:06,480
 could mean that the user needs a copy of what they're consenting to or they need some kind

135
0:19:06,480 --> 0:19:13,480
 of permanent access to the system. Maybe they need to store it in a wallet. There's many

136
0:19:14,360 --> 0:19:22,360
 ways probably of implementing this. And then it needs to be auditable. So we need to be

137
0:19:22,400 --> 0:19:29,400
 able to say when we did this and this action requires consent, then we need to track the

138
0:19:31,040 --> 0:19:38,040
 action in a way that we can prove that we had the consent when we did that. So it needs

139
0:19:39,280 --> 0:19:46,280
 to be auditable by someone and especially when it comes to GDPR, then users can at any

140
0:19:47,280 --> 0:19:53,280
 point in time require that you show proof that what you did was based on consent or

141
0:19:53,280 --> 0:20:03,280
 legitimate interest. But you need to be able to prove that. And other functions from GDPR

142
0:20:03,280 --> 0:20:11,280
 is this right to be forgotten and also the right to have your data corrected and so on.

143
0:20:11,280 --> 0:20:24,280
 Good to have all of that. And then it's a task now to implement. I just want to show

144
0:20:24,720 --> 0:20:31,720
 this table, though, because what we found when working with specification for consent

145
0:20:32,120 --> 0:20:38,580
 was that people working with other systems that needed consent, they were sometimes confusing

146
0:20:38,580 --> 0:20:42,660
 it with a normal agreement, but also they were asking the question, can't we also use

147
0:20:42,660 --> 0:20:49,180
 this consent system to store regular agreements, any kind of contract? And that's where the

148
0:20:49,180 --> 0:20:56,180
 consent specification gets too muddy. So we want to be strict on what is consent and what

149
0:20:58,860 --> 0:21:04,100
 is something else like a regular contract. The first thing was this point of it being

150
0:21:04,100 --> 0:21:10,980
 voluntary. If there is a reject and accept button, then we're good. Then it's voluntary.

151
0:21:10,980 --> 0:21:17,980
 People can reject it and the system understands the rejection. Then we need to have a purpose

152
0:21:18,580 --> 0:21:25,580
 declared and intention. That's kind of what consent does. You say yes to something that

153
0:21:25,980 --> 0:21:32,980
 then happens, probably also has expiry. But with contracts, it's not always the case

154
0:21:34,100 --> 0:21:39,580
 that you have contracts and agreements. Then you have more requirements or obligations

155
0:21:39,580 --> 0:21:46,580
 that have to happen. And they probably also will happen. Because contracts and agreements,

156
0:21:48,500 --> 0:21:55,500
 they have things about what happens if you don't do that. It's a promise of some kind,

157
0:21:56,140 --> 0:22:02,380
 whereas consent, the one that gives the consent can just revoke it. So I put those in contrast.

158
0:22:02,380 --> 0:22:09,220
 And then the auditable part is something where I would say that the contract and agreement

159
0:22:09,220 --> 0:22:16,220
 often is signed in a way that in itself it becomes the object that upholds its own consent,

160
0:22:16,380 --> 0:22:22,340
 where the consent relates to a lot of actions that need to prove that they are related to

161
0:22:22,340 --> 0:22:29,340
 that particular consent. So some examples that are not very clear,

162
0:22:33,380 --> 0:22:42,380
 cookie banners is that government, for instance, I'll just mention the two last ones, but very

163
0:22:44,140 --> 0:22:51,140
 typical government will want to, institution will want to get your personal data from registry

164
0:22:51,980 --> 0:22:58,660
 somewhere or exchange data in some kind of way to do an administrative task. That needs

165
0:22:58,820 --> 0:23:03,860
 consent often. But that's because you can reject it. So if you reject it, you replace

166
0:23:03,860 --> 0:23:08,980
 it with another process. Then you can just give them the information by showing your

167
0:23:08,980 --> 0:23:15,220
 ID or by fetching it from somewhere and manually handing it over and so on.

168
0:23:15,220 --> 0:23:20,260
 Another example is communication, where you accept that someone sends you a newsletter,

169
0:23:20,260 --> 0:23:26,180
 and when you withdraw that consent, they stop sending you the newsletter. And then the one

170
0:23:26,180 --> 0:23:31,220
 sending out the newsletter can of course store, like now I sent to these people, based

171
0:23:31,220 --> 0:23:36,580
 on this consent, you can anonymise or hash the email addresses. So you can build a nice

172
0:23:36,580 --> 0:23:43,580
 little system that's consent based. And actually it's the subscribe unsubscribe function of

173
0:23:43,900 --> 0:23:50,900
 the newsletter. So when we build this, we need to ask some

174
0:23:51,740 --> 0:23:58,740
 questions, like in order to establish informed consent, there are some risks. And the best

175
0:24:02,660 --> 0:24:09,660
 example of consent is when it comes to risks, is medical consent. There will be a lot of

176
0:24:10,180 --> 0:24:17,180
 risks implied with a medical procedure. And if the patient is conscious, you want informed

177
0:24:18,180 --> 0:24:25,180
 consent, and they are incentivised to read it because the risks are very high. Whereas

178
0:24:25,500 --> 0:24:32,500
 in the example of data exchange, the user can perceive no risk at all and not want to

179
0:24:32,820 --> 0:24:39,100
 read it. And that's where it gets a little bit more of a UX task, like how do we present

180
0:24:39,100 --> 0:24:46,100
 this thing so that the user actually perceives an incentive to go through it.

181
0:24:47,660 --> 0:24:54,660
 And that's a task not just for the legal department. I think if you just ask the legal department

182
0:24:56,500 --> 0:25:00,460
 to do the whole consent thing, you're going to get a legal text. And then you will have

183
0:25:00,460 --> 0:25:06,220
 the problem of turning the legal text into informed consent. You need something that

184
0:25:06,220 --> 0:25:12,740
 feeds people an understanding of the purpose and the risks and so on.

185
0:25:13,340 --> 0:25:19,060
 Then the last part is also to ask, like, is any of this in the user's interest? Maybe

186
0:25:19,060 --> 0:25:25,380
 ask that. And then if the answer is no, then ask if consent is really the solution then,

187
0:25:25,380 --> 0:25:30,780
 if you're doing something against the user's interest or not zero interest in it. It's

188
0:25:30,780 --> 0:25:37,220
 hard to push in consent because it will not be informed consent.

189
0:25:37,220 --> 0:25:44,220
 So try to put this proposal, kind of now it looks a little bit academic, that consent

190
0:25:45,620 --> 0:25:52,260
 is understood as a voluntary, well-informed and revocable declaration by an individual

191
0:25:52,260 --> 0:25:59,260
 for another party to use and process that data in a specific way. And we have established

192
0:26:00,260 --> 0:26:07,260
 a similar definition in a project that I'm part of that is government-oriented. It's

193
0:26:10,540 --> 0:26:16,020
 a little bit like a slightly simpler version of it. So before giving the talk, I decided

194
0:26:16,020 --> 0:26:23,020
 to add some more to the definition to make sure it's like a good and strong definition.

195
0:26:23,740 --> 0:26:30,740
 Then in this project called GovStack where we are working with a specification for consent,

196
0:26:35,780 --> 0:26:42,780
 we have also had to add something as an example of what consent is not. And that's like the

197
0:26:42,780 --> 0:26:49,780
 second clause to the definition is, let's say, the use of consent should be avoided

198
0:26:54,380 --> 0:27:01,380
 in these cases when a person is simply informed by an organization. It's like it's just an

199
0:27:02,980 --> 0:27:09,980
 information and you cannot project it or whatever. And when the consent is simply informed,

200
0:27:12,780 --> 0:27:17,340
 the system or platform that is dealing with consent has no way to identify the person

201
0:27:17,340 --> 0:27:24,340
 or has no way to establish the consent is actually real. Because then the owner of the

202
0:27:26,340 --> 0:27:33,340
 consent platform can also suddenly invent consent that's not so good. So we want a system

203
0:27:33,500 --> 0:27:39,140
 that's tied up to some other system that can ensure that there is a signature or some kind

204
0:27:39,140 --> 0:27:46,140
 of stamp on the consent. I'll get back to the data models for this because now is the

205
0:27:47,180 --> 0:27:54,180
 time for getting closer to, I've made a typo there, for the specification for digital consent.

206
0:27:56,340 --> 0:28:02,500
 And I have copy pasted the typo to each and every of the following slides. So the high

207
0:28:02,500 --> 0:28:08,220
 level requirement is to say we need privacy by design and privacy by default. I hope that

208
0:28:08,260 --> 0:28:15,260
 you've heard the terms before because I just really like those terms and they're a very

209
0:28:15,620 --> 0:28:22,620
 good starting point for specifying the system. And in privacy by design, we want to say we

210
0:28:26,740 --> 0:28:33,340
 start to design our whole system of data models, not just the consent models but also in the

211
0:28:33,340 --> 0:28:38,380
 rest of the system when something has to do with consent, we need to sort of plug it

212
0:28:38,380 --> 0:28:45,380
 into our consent system so that we know what to do when consent expires. So do things based

213
0:28:47,620 --> 0:28:54,620
 on the fact that consent should exist. If you are doing an operation in a system, maybe

214
0:28:54,620 --> 0:29:01,620
 you need to check for the consent before even proceeding. That could be a way. Then we also

215
0:29:01,620 --> 0:29:07,820
 want the privacy by default. So that's very simple with this. Like we just assume that

216
0:29:07,820 --> 0:29:12,940
 the user hasn't consented. That's how we design the whole system. There is no consent. And

217
0:29:12,940 --> 0:29:19,940
 then we have the entire track of how the system should work without the consent. So the advantage

218
0:29:21,900 --> 0:29:28,900
 is that actually consent can be a liability in itself. If you're storing a lot of consent,

219
0:29:32,180 --> 0:29:38,180
 with person identifiable information next to the consent, then the consent system in

220
0:29:38,180 --> 0:29:45,180
 itself contains things that are privacy related. And if people are rejecting something, and

221
0:29:48,740 --> 0:29:52,980
 you are then storing the rejection, then you're storing the fact that this person doesn't

222
0:29:52,980 --> 0:29:59,980
 want to do this. So we can get rid of that by defaulting to having rejections. So we

223
0:30:01,620 --> 0:30:08,620
 did some work in the GovStack project. And these are five pillars of the work. Firstly,

224
0:30:22,860 --> 0:30:29,860
 we have done this based on some use cases. And the first use case is related to a model

225
0:30:31,620 --> 0:30:38,620
 mother and child that goes to a health care centre and how this child is being registered

226
0:30:40,540 --> 0:30:47,540
 in the health care centre. And the second one is about payment in a public sector also.

227
0:30:53,420 --> 0:31:00,420
 So benefits, you can say. And how to do those payouts and sort of manage data around citizens

228
0:31:01,980 --> 0:31:08,980
 and we're not quite there yet. There's a lot of complexity in this. But we've started now

229
0:31:10,780 --> 0:31:17,780
 to have enough that we can say that we have a functional specification for the most simple

230
0:31:18,260 --> 0:31:24,420
 things. And there are some requirements, some UX requirements, some data models, and an

231
0:31:24,420 --> 0:31:30,020
 open API specification. In the functional requirements, you need the administration

232
0:31:30,140 --> 0:31:37,140
 part of the system. Someone needs to be able to configure and set up everything. So the

233
0:31:37,780 --> 0:31:44,900
 administrator or configuration owner, those are the ones that are responsible for adding

234
0:31:44,900 --> 0:31:51,900
 things that are like the texts that the user sees and should be able to update those texts

235
0:31:52,180 --> 0:31:59,180
 and see how things work out. Maybe mass reject everything when the consent is updated. And

236
0:32:00,780 --> 0:32:07,780
 the administrator also needs to be able to administer the general policy, privacy policy

237
0:32:10,740 --> 0:32:17,740
 that guides maybe all the handling of data inside the organisation. So we've got a bunch

238
0:32:18,020 --> 0:32:25,020
 of functionality there. Then we've got the individual user who is in need of seeing her

239
0:32:30,620 --> 0:32:37,620
 consent agreement, as we call it, so being presented by something to consent to, and

240
0:32:38,780 --> 0:32:45,780
 then actually accepting or rejecting that. What we're used to seeing is like mega collections

241
0:32:47,020 --> 0:32:54,020
 of a million things to toggle on and off. And we've just kind of envisioned that there

242
0:32:54,780 --> 0:33:01,780
 is one thing at a time, and then you click accept or reject. And of course they need

243
0:33:04,140 --> 0:33:10,300
 to be able to look at what they have consented to later, and they need to be able to send

244
0:33:10,300 --> 0:33:17,300
 revocations for things later in time. Yeah. So it's kind of obvious. The other part is

245
0:33:18,300 --> 0:33:25,300
 not so obvious. That's the auditing part, and we've kept that separate from system administration

246
0:33:28,580 --> 0:33:35,580
 and users' individual functions. So this is an area that I think we will have a lot of

247
0:33:35,580 --> 0:33:42,580
 future work with, and kind of understanding this whole aspect of what does auditing versus

248
0:33:51,500 --> 0:33:58,500
 privacy mean, like what are we actually now delegating the auditor to have access to.

249
0:33:58,540 --> 0:34:04,940
 Auditing can also happen through that someone looks into the consent system to see what

250
0:34:04,980 --> 0:34:09,300
 is stored in the system, but it can also happen that auditors should be able to access the

251
0:34:09,300 --> 0:34:15,180
 system that is doing stuff based on consent to see that things matches. Auditing can also

252
0:34:15,180 --> 0:34:22,180
 be that a third party is owning copies of what is happening in this consent platform

253
0:34:22,180 --> 0:34:28,460
 and then able to do their own auditing afterwards. We've tried not to specify exactly how that

254
0:34:28,540 --> 0:34:35,540
 happens but to have a larger palette for that. Then we have the UX requirements, which I

255
0:34:39,540 --> 0:34:44,980
 really wanted to have shown some of the mock-ups, but I didn't have the latest copy, but it's

256
0:34:44,980 --> 0:34:51,980
 fairly simple requirements. I think that's the common sense that you would have if you

257
0:34:52,420 --> 0:34:59,420
 thought about consent from your own perspective, like how would I like to be asked. So the

258
0:34:59,420 --> 0:35:06,180
 first requirement that I really liked in this UX specification was that we want to just

259
0:35:06,180 --> 0:35:12,620
 be clear about what data do we need, what are we doing here, why are we doing it and

260
0:35:12,620 --> 0:35:19,620
 what does the user benefit from this or risk from it. And then the duration is also really

261
0:35:20,220 --> 0:35:24,900
 important, like is this indefinite or is it just some data that we have for a week and

262
0:35:24,900 --> 0:35:31,900
 then we nuke it again. Super nice things to be reminded of, and I think that reading the

263
0:35:32,740 --> 0:35:39,740
 UX specification can even end up being the entry point for understanding this platform,

264
0:35:41,060 --> 0:35:48,060
 however it's made up. They also had a really nice note in the UX specification that says

265
0:35:49,700 --> 0:35:54,740
 UX requirements, which is kind of a different take on what I said earlier, that the system,

266
0:35:54,740 --> 0:36:00,300
 if the users reject the consent request, then the ones that are designing UX for a whole

267
0:36:00,300 --> 0:36:05,100
 application, they need to actually have a user journey where the consent is rejected,

268
0:36:05,100 --> 0:36:10,520
 and many people always think how people would like to use their system in the accept kind

269
0:36:10,520 --> 0:36:16,420
 of scenario, and then they forget that there is also a user journey where consent has been

270
0:36:16,420 --> 0:36:23,420
 rejected. And very important also, when you're having the first exchange with the user and

271
0:36:30,380 --> 0:36:35,940
 showing we need your consent here, of course it should be visible, what do you do then

272
0:36:35,940 --> 0:36:42,940
 if you change your mind. I've also seen UX mock-ups that actually lodge a consent dialogue

273
0:36:43,740 --> 0:36:50,260
 in a survey all the way through the survey, so you start by saying yes, I can accept this,

274
0:36:50,260 --> 0:36:54,660
 but then as you're asked more and more questions in the survey, you're reminded that now I'm

275
0:36:54,660 --> 0:37:01,660
 sharing this data, now I'm sharing this data, so then you can actually reject having your

276
0:37:02,580 --> 0:37:08,860
 personal details attached to the answer, or something like that, but have this information

277
0:37:08,860 --> 0:37:15,860
 about changing your mind visible, and have first class user interface for it.

278
0:37:18,580 --> 0:37:25,580
 So then we had some data models, and now is the time that I can again say that I'm a software

279
0:37:28,460 --> 0:37:35,460
 developer, so I kind of want to get to this step, because then I know what to do, and

280
0:37:36,460 --> 0:37:43,300
 this was the most simple version we could come up with, to just show what are the general

281
0:37:43,300 --> 0:37:50,300
 entities in the system. We have this configuration area, that's where we manage the components

282
0:37:54,100 --> 0:38:01,100
 of consent. So then we have the individual models that store the consent of the individuals

283
0:38:01,100 --> 0:38:08,100
 to something, and our terminology is that, and this is the core of building this system,

284
0:38:11,700 --> 0:38:18,700
 is to understand these data models, because then I think we'll go to a nice place where

285
0:38:21,220 --> 0:38:28,220
 consent makes sense, or at least makes more sense, is to model with a data model that

286
0:38:31,140 --> 0:38:38,140
 has a data policy, so that's your general policy for data, keep that separate. And then

287
0:38:39,660 --> 0:38:46,660
 the consent agreement itself, which is the purpose, what data, and why and for how long,

288
0:38:46,980 --> 0:38:52,060
 and so on, there's some properties, we call that a consent agreement. And then we have

289
0:38:52,060 --> 0:38:59,060
 a consent record, so a consent record, as you can see with the arrow, that's the link

290
0:38:59,060 --> 0:39:06,060
 between an individual and a consent agreement, stating that the individual has consented

291
0:39:06,900 --> 0:39:13,900
 to it. And now, of course, I should say that we have a model that's called individual,

292
0:39:14,060 --> 0:39:18,180
 but whether or not it's a natural person, that doesn't matter to the system, it can

293
0:39:18,180 --> 0:39:25,180
 be any kind of unique, if it's just an email address, maybe it just contains a hash of

294
0:39:25,980 --> 0:39:32,980
 the email address, and then that's all the system knows. So we also have the data, we

295
0:39:41,900 --> 0:39:48,900
 have a data provider or consumer or processor, they also need to be able to look at consent

296
0:39:49,100 --> 0:39:56,100
 in order to determine if the operation that they are doing has consent stored. Then there

297
0:39:56,660 --> 0:40:03,660
 is also a procedure, of course, that makes sure that the system can return yes or no,

298
0:40:04,700 --> 0:40:11,700
 but not necessarily state whether the user exists or not. It's an API, basically.

299
0:40:11,700 --> 0:40:18,700
 Yeah. So I really like this slide. I'm sorry it took so long to get here, but if you have

300
0:40:28,420 --> 0:40:35,420
 any questions around it, then be sure to ask them if we have time. Now I'll just make it

301
0:40:35,420 --> 0:40:42,420
 a little bit worse, because I thought this was okay simple, and add a little bit. What

302
0:40:49,340 --> 0:40:56,340
 I'm adding here is the auditing part, because what we are especially interested in is that

303
0:40:56,580 --> 0:41:03,580
 if the user changes their mind, or the consent agreement changes, or the data policy changes,

304
0:41:06,740 --> 0:41:13,740
 then we need to track that, otherwise we don't know anything about the past. So in the specification

305
0:41:13,740 --> 0:41:20,740
 we have proposed that there is a revisioning system that can track things if it's okay

306
0:41:21,460 --> 0:41:28,460
 to track them. And we have signatures, and if there is a way for the individual to actually

307
0:41:33,620 --> 0:41:37,740
 sign their consent, of course they should be able to do that, especially if it's the

308
0:41:37,740 --> 0:41:44,740
 public sector. They have all sorts of platforms for that. And we've also added the lifecycle,

309
0:41:44,740 --> 0:41:51,740
 and preparing the system, the specification, was a way of understanding that consent has

310
0:42:02,260 --> 0:42:08,580
 a lifecycle from where it hatches in a legal department, maybe that says we need this,

311
0:42:08,580 --> 0:42:15,580
 and then in a place where the whole aspect, legal aspect of it maybe is being prepared,

312
0:42:17,460 --> 0:42:24,460
 and then people interact with the system, but it may get used, it may change, that's

313
0:42:24,700 --> 0:42:31,700
 why we have the revisioning. And finally we need to be able to establish proofs both,

314
0:42:31,980 --> 0:42:36,900
 so that systems that are using it can see that there is consent, and so that auditing

315
0:42:36,900 --> 0:42:43,900
 can see that. So this high level view is also turned into an open API, specification

316
0:42:46,940 --> 0:42:52,500
 where it's like specific schemas with specific fields, so that's very nice. All of this is

317
0:42:52,500 --> 0:42:59,500
 just a specification though, so it's not an actual tool. So I want to go further now,

318
0:43:00,500 --> 0:43:07,500
 because what I think we are ready to do is to take this specification, build an open

319
0:43:08,660 --> 0:43:15,660
 source tool that is not necessarily for governments, that's probably very heavy, but at least can

320
0:43:18,780 --> 0:43:24,580
 work for organisations that we are dealing with in our everyday life that wants to ask

321
0:43:24,740 --> 0:43:30,980
 our users simple things like send a newsletter or store some information, because we want

322
0:43:30,980 --> 0:43:37,980
 to do a statistic in our organisation about something. Let's have a tool that can do that

323
0:43:37,980 --> 0:43:44,980
 the right way. And I thought that since I'm from the Django world, I thought that we can

324
0:43:48,700 --> 0:43:53,400
 build it with Django, because it's so nice to write data models in Django, and it's kind

325
0:43:53,400 --> 0:44:00,400
 of like a rapid thing, so we can get quickly from prototype to something that we can implement

326
0:44:02,840 --> 0:44:09,580
 in a real project. And I hope that this platform will turn into something that can both be

327
0:44:09,580 --> 0:44:14,400
 a standalone platform that has an API, so that you don't need to use Django in order

328
0:44:14,400 --> 0:44:21,400
 to use the application here, but if you use Django, then you can also do some added things,

329
0:44:21,480 --> 0:44:28,400
 so especially I'm thinking about adding a specific Django consent field that data models

330
0:44:28,400 --> 0:44:35,400
 can say, I'm a row in a database that's based on consent, and if the consent changes, then

331
0:44:35,960 --> 0:44:42,960
 I want to be deleted, or I want to have this particular field anonymised, or whatever.

332
0:44:44,140 --> 0:44:50,120
 And people have been playing around with this before, but I found that the older tools were

333
0:44:50,160 --> 0:44:57,160
 based on GDPR understandings, and they were kind of abandoned now, so the idea was to

334
0:44:59,640 --> 0:45:05,000
 start the project and have these thoughts around the consent definition and specification

335
0:45:05,000 --> 0:45:12,000
 from GovStack used as a way to bootstrap the project. So it has a repository. I just added

336
0:45:12,840 --> 0:45:19,840
 a matrix channel today, so if you're interested in joining that channel, you can use it to

337
0:45:23,480 --> 0:45:28,480
 get updated on how it's going with the project, and you're also very welcome to participate

338
0:45:28,480 --> 0:45:35,480
 in it. And then I wanted to add that I'm here, but only today at the event, so I hope you

339
0:45:42,000 --> 0:45:48,400
 grab me to talk some more about consent, maybe here, maybe in the back. I will use

340
0:45:48,400 --> 0:45:52,960
 your input, I hope that's okay, so if you tell me something about how you think about

341
0:45:52,960 --> 0:45:59,960
 consent, I will definitely get inspired and try and use that. And if you want to get involved

342
0:46:00,320 --> 0:46:06,360
 in the project, that would be super awesome. And my last recommendation here is that there

343
0:46:06,360 --> 0:46:13,360
 is a super nice little episode of All Hail the Algorithm, which is an Al Jazeera series

344
0:46:14,720 --> 0:46:21,720
 that some years ago actually took up the concept and really communicates it super well, makes

345
0:46:22,400 --> 0:46:29,400
 it exciting and makes it essential for everyday folks. I take questions, if there are any,

346
0:46:29,400 --> 0:46:36,400
 and thank you. Do we have any questions for Benjamin?

347
0:46:42,280 --> 0:46:49,280
 So we talked about this a bit earlier, but it seems to me the biggest players in the

348
0:46:50,080 --> 0:46:57,080
 game of tracking people's PII have a vested interest in not really getting consent from

349
0:46:57,560 --> 0:47:02,920
 people and patterns of behavior that indicate that they're not really interested in informed

350
0:47:02,920 --> 0:47:09,480
 user consent, they're interested in maintaining their status quo and finding loopholes that

351
0:47:09,480 --> 0:47:15,160
 allow them to continue doing that. And I think it's great that we think about how we can

352
0:47:15,160 --> 0:47:20,400
 serve our users and how we can respect their data and their privacy, but it feels to me

353
0:47:20,400 --> 0:47:27,000
 like the biggest problem is these bigger organizations that aren't going to play ball, no matter

354
0:47:27,440 --> 0:47:33,040
 what solutions exist. And I was wondering what you think about that and ways that you

355
0:47:33,040 --> 0:47:40,040
 see of affecting a more positive change given those actors like Google, Facebook, other

356
0:47:42,040 --> 0:47:46,360
 tech. Yeah, that's a really great question. I think

357
0:47:46,360 --> 0:47:51,800
 there is some kind of tactical political game buried here that maybe we should stop even

358
0:47:51,880 --> 0:47:57,440
 allowing them the right to use the word consent for these cookie banners. Maybe it's better

359
0:47:57,440 --> 0:48:04,440
 to just say cookie banners. And then if we can get as far as building a tool that deals

360
0:48:05,520 --> 0:48:09,840
 with real consent, I think we'll discover that the tool is absolutely useless for the

361
0:48:09,840 --> 0:48:14,080
 type of data sharing that cookie banners are used for. So we'll just have a great tool

362
0:48:14,080 --> 0:48:21,080
 that is great for actual consent and then it's easier to see the differences. If that

363
0:48:21,960 --> 0:48:28,960
 can work as a strategy, I would pick that because it's always nice to be able to show

364
0:48:31,080 --> 0:48:38,080
 the real consent. And yes, they will not... I mean, I'm pretty sure that at some point

365
0:48:42,600 --> 0:48:47,480
 someone is going to make a proposal in the European Parliament because now it's not the

366
0:48:47,480 --> 0:48:51,680
 same Parliament that gave us GDPR. It's a different Parliament. And someone is going

367
0:48:51,680 --> 0:48:56,200
 to say, look at this. This is absurd. Let's get rid of it and go back to the good old

368
0:48:56,200 --> 0:49:02,160
 days where we just shared data without even having the cookie banners. I mean, maybe that

369
0:49:02,160 --> 0:49:06,480
 could even be better for actually having consent now that everyone understands what shady stuff

370
0:49:06,480 --> 0:49:12,960
 is going on anyways. Kind of weird to have a cookie banner that you just kind of know

371
0:49:13,200 --> 0:49:20,200
 that it's being mismanaged and it's not really authentic. So, yeah.

372
0:49:20,200 --> 0:49:24,560
 Do you have one more question?

373
0:49:24,560 --> 0:49:29,560
 Thank you. I had a similar thought, but I think during the presentation you, without

374
0:49:29,560 --> 0:49:34,960
 intending, proposed an approach to dealing with the disservices that don't respect end

375
0:49:34,960 --> 0:49:41,960
 user freedoms. You said it's impractical to record every IP address I've used and every

376
0:49:42,120 --> 0:49:46,240
 website I've accessed, but actually I don't think so. We could make a browser extension

377
0:49:46,240 --> 0:49:52,440
 that does that and automatically request to be forgotten. Would that be a reasonable approach

378
0:49:52,440 --> 0:49:56,640
 for dealing with the sort of company that we were just discussing?

379
0:49:56,640 --> 0:50:03,640
 Yeah, I didn't think anyone would say that, but I'm glad you say it. Because if someone

380
0:50:04,640 --> 0:50:11,640
 can establish what they are doing as a person and giving and not giving consent to and then

381
0:50:13,640 --> 0:50:19,680
 use that to inquire into their data in a very precise manner and finding out that things

382
0:50:19,680 --> 0:50:26,680
 are happening or not happening as they should be, then we have a case that can be a legal

383
0:50:26,680 --> 0:50:33,680
 case, right? Then we can escalate from there. But, I mean, with all those pages in a typical

384
0:50:35,240 --> 0:50:42,240
 consent cookie banner, I should say, sorry, it seems like it's a very lot of legal details

385
0:50:44,200 --> 0:50:51,000
 going on. So it will be a big thing if we get that. But if we make the first step and

386
0:50:51,000 --> 0:50:56,240
 we can see that there is something more buried, then I think it's worth doing, especially

387
0:50:56,240 --> 0:51:02,200
 with the do not track header. Maybe that's also a simple way to establish, like, I'm

388
0:51:02,200 --> 0:51:06,400
 using a do not track header. Why are you not respecting it? Should you legally respect

389
0:51:06,400 --> 0:51:13,400
 that? I'm interested in why you connect government

390
0:51:15,760 --> 0:51:22,760
 building blocks to consent. Because from my understanding, most of what we do in government

391
0:51:23,240 --> 0:51:30,240
 don't really need any consent. So is government here actually the holder of the consent? Or

392
0:51:30,800 --> 0:51:37,800
 why is government involved? So I didn't include anything on the GovStack

393
0:51:39,280 --> 0:51:46,280
 project because I was afraid that would take up a lot of time to explain. But GovStack

394
0:51:47,280 --> 0:51:54,280
 is essentially not a government owned project, but it does have governments in it that the

395
0:51:57,920 --> 0:52:04,920
 German foreign aid ministry is in it, Estonian government is in it, the ITU, the international

396
0:52:05,720 --> 0:52:12,720
 telecoms union is in it, and the digital impact alliance is in it. So these organisations,

397
0:52:12,720 --> 0:52:19,720
 these organisations, they wanted from the beginning to be able to supply that functionality

398
0:52:22,800 --> 0:52:29,800
 from an understanding that it is the right thing to do. But there's many places where

399
0:52:30,560 --> 0:52:36,160
 you don't need it. You could just, like, not have this so-called building block in your

400
0:52:36,160 --> 0:52:42,080
 set of building blocks because the legal situation would say you can do whatever you want because

401
0:52:42,080 --> 0:52:46,640
 you're a government. But I think when the tool is available, at least even though the

402
0:52:46,640 --> 0:52:53,640
 government doesn't have to, then they could. And what we found also when we were building

403
0:52:55,280 --> 0:53:02,520
 this specification was that there aren't any tools that satisfy our specification. So I

404
0:53:02,520 --> 0:53:08,480
 think that was an important discovery in itself, was to work with this, set up the specification

405
0:53:08,480 --> 0:53:15,480
 and then discover, hey, we actually need open source tools and Govstack is based on open

406
0:53:16,280 --> 0:53:22,880
 source. That makes it also interesting. Digital common goods in this context. And we need

407
0:53:22,880 --> 0:53:29,880
 a digital common good that can satisfy this consent specification. Yeah.

408
0:53:30,480 --> 0:53:37,480
 Thank you. Sorry, I wasn't for the whole talk, so I apologise in advance if I'm asking something

409
0:53:39,320 --> 0:53:45,640
 that you already brought to the topic. But I have two parts, well, two questions. Actually,

410
0:53:45,640 --> 0:53:52,640
 the first one, so talking about legal, have you made some approach to some kind of organisation

411
0:53:53,520 --> 0:54:00,520
 like, I mean, we have an organisation called Legal Tech Lab, so legal tech is kind of a

412
0:54:00,840 --> 0:54:07,840
 buzzword for now. But is there something happening in that and that you can make a case regarding

413
0:54:08,360 --> 0:54:15,360
 like, hey, I'm not giving consent or this consent was not acquired in a legal attaining

414
0:54:16,360 --> 0:54:23,360
 context, so this is not valid, therefore you are not permitted to keep my data. So that's

415
0:54:24,240 --> 0:54:31,240
 the first question that I have. It's unfortunate that I don't personally

416
0:54:33,120 --> 0:54:40,000
 go out and do the work of seeing what's going on in that department, but it seems like in

417
0:54:40,000 --> 0:54:47,000
 the room there is actually a little spark of energy to also go that direction, so we

418
0:54:48,400 --> 0:54:55,400
 could say like, we are building a tool that can actually do the things we want in relation

419
0:54:55,400 --> 0:55:02,400
 to consent, but then we also want to expose these practices of fake consent or not respecting

420
0:55:02,400 --> 0:55:09,400
 the consent, so I would encourage myself and everyone to look for that, because it could

421
0:55:14,920 --> 0:55:16,440
 be something, yeah.

422
0:55:16,440 --> 0:55:22,400
 And yeah, the second question that I had is like also considering reaching to the parliament

423
0:55:22,400 --> 0:55:29,400
 for having something to pass by, that will require, for instance, taking a look at vulnerable

424
0:55:29,400 --> 0:55:36,400
 groups, like let's say Germany is not my first language, so I will just be giving consent

425
0:55:37,840 --> 0:55:44,840
 in order to get into a website to search for an apartment, so things of that nature, saying

426
0:55:45,800 --> 0:55:51,640
 like, okay, if you are requesting consent from this person, at least have the decency

427
0:55:51,640 --> 0:55:57,640
 to put the information on the language that they can understand, or for sites that are

428
0:55:57,880 --> 0:56:04,880
 just providing that in a certain language, or also looking at elderly people that for

429
0:56:04,880 --> 0:56:09,920
 them would be like, yeah, I mean, I don't know, I just want to see pictures of my nieces,

430
0:56:09,920 --> 0:56:16,680
 just get me in there, I will consent to anything, so it feels like kind of taking advantage,

431
0:56:16,680 --> 0:56:22,680
 so I was just asking if this is also something that can be considered.

432
0:56:22,760 --> 0:56:29,760
 Yeah, it definitely makes me want to say again, like the informed part of consent, it should

433
0:56:31,120 --> 0:56:35,840
 be part of the definition. If there is no informed consent, then it's not really consent,

434
0:56:35,840 --> 0:56:37,920
 what is it, then I don't know.

435
0:56:37,920 --> 0:56:43,920
 The second part was that I forgot to mention accessibility and UX requirements, so of course

436
0:56:43,920 --> 0:56:50,920
 UX has to be catering for the user's needs, yeah, super basic stuff, so I think that's

437
0:56:52,760 --> 0:56:57,760
 what I should have added to that, thank you.

438
0:56:57,760 --> 0:57:04,760
 In my experience, users, so every user, they find it very hard to make that risk assessment

439
0:57:07,040 --> 0:57:14,040
 of what is the consequence of me giving, except that you can use my data, so how will this

440
0:57:15,840 --> 0:57:22,080
 tool help people do that risk assessment? I know for the site, okay, I can see if I

441
0:57:22,080 --> 0:57:25,680
 make a consent, I can do this, I cannot do that, I understand that, but in the broader

442
0:57:25,680 --> 0:57:33,000
 picture, how will it help that assessment?

443
0:57:33,000 --> 0:57:40,000
 I think that knowing that you can always go back and revoke your consent and from the

444
0:57:40,000 --> 0:57:47,000
 beginning knowing how to do that is super critical, because yes, we cannot guarantee

445
0:57:47,960 --> 0:57:54,960
 that the user actually reads what they accept, there's no guarantee of that, like they scroll

446
0:57:55,080 --> 0:57:59,320
 through the window in two seconds or five seconds or 20 seconds, when have they read

447
0:57:59,320 --> 0:58:06,320
 it? These types of functionality doesn't work, but maybe establishing a convention about

448
0:58:09,000 --> 0:58:16,000
 consent so that if you have a user interface, then kind of the same way that we are switching

449
0:58:16,000 --> 0:58:22,800
 between light, dark mode themes or switching languages, we also know that this icon means

450
0:58:22,800 --> 0:58:29,080
 consent, I don't even know if maybe someone uses the check box to say it's about consent,

451
0:58:29,080 --> 0:58:35,440
 but yeah, like a well-established convention for consent will mean that people can change

452
0:58:35,440 --> 0:58:42,440
 it and then have a system that understands that consent can always change at any time.

453
0:58:42,440 --> 0:58:50,080
 Awesome, we are at the hour, let's give a round of applause for Benjamin.
