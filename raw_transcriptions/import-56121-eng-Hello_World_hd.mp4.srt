0:00:00,000 --> 0:00:21,680
 Hello, everybody, and welcome to Bornhack 2023.

2
0:00:21,680 --> 0:00:27,240
 The first organizers arrived here about a week ago, and it is insane to look around

3
0:00:27,240 --> 0:00:32,560
 and see how much has changed, and all the volunteers who have helped have done so much

4
0:00:32,560 --> 0:00:34,800
 work and deserve all our gratitude.

5
0:00:34,800 --> 0:00:40,960
 We'll get back to that later, but it is fantastic to see everybody putting up camps and moving

6
0:00:40,960 --> 0:00:46,520
 into the field and unpacking and starting to build our temporary home for the next week.

7
0:00:46,520 --> 0:00:50,000
 Well, I mean, technically, Bornhack is a two-week event, right?

8
0:00:50,000 --> 0:00:55,400
 It's only the volunteers know that secret, so you get to be here much longer if you help

9
0:00:55,400 --> 0:01:00,880
 out with build up and chat out.

10
0:01:00,880 --> 0:01:03,160
 We are very excited.

11
0:01:03,160 --> 0:01:08,580
 This has been a year of many challenges, and well, it always is, but maybe some particularly

12
0:01:08,580 --> 0:01:10,520
 big ones this year.

13
0:01:10,520 --> 0:01:13,280
 In particular, some sad news.

14
0:01:13,280 --> 0:01:19,320
 We lost one of our organizers, Jesper, this year, or last year, in October, very suddenly

15
0:01:19,760 --> 0:01:26,760
 and way too soon, and it hit all of us hard.

16
0:01:26,760 --> 0:01:32,560
 We dedicated the tagline for this year to Jesper, Make Legacy, because we feel that

17
0:01:32,560 --> 0:01:39,560
 everybody wants to leave a legacy, and Jesper absolutely did leave a legacy.

18
0:01:40,980 --> 0:01:47,980
 He had a tremendous impact on Bornhack as an organization and on all of us personally.

19
0:01:50,320 --> 0:01:57,320
 He left a giant void.

20
0:01:58,040 --> 0:02:03,960
 Thank you to the people in info and the people in wellness who have stepped up to fill the

21
0:02:03,960 --> 0:02:05,500
 void after him.

22
0:02:05,500 --> 0:02:12,500
 Thank you in particular to the new radio team and to Maunus who have sponsored the new radios

23
0:02:13,500 --> 0:02:20,500
 and the new repeater and everything so we can continue the work that Jesper did in every

24
0:02:20,620 --> 0:02:23,020
 sense of the word.

25
0:02:23,020 --> 0:02:30,020
 There's nothing really we can do to properly mark this, but I wanted to do a minute of

26
0:02:30,980 --> 0:02:35,140
 silence, but instead I think that doesn't feel right because Jesper wasn't the silent

27
0:02:35,140 --> 0:02:36,140
 type.

28
0:02:36,260 --> 0:02:43,260
 Instead, we'll do 30 seconds of silence and then 30 seconds of applause to celebrate his

29
0:02:43,700 --> 0:02:44,700
 life.

30
0:02:44,700 --> 0:02:47,700
 Starting now.

31
0:03:06,140 --> 0:03:13,140
 Thank you.

32
0:03:36,140 --> 0:03:43,140
 Thank you all. It means a lot. Give me 30 seconds. Cheers. Cheers. Cheers. Cheers.

33
0:04:06,140 --> 0:04:13,140
 It's not a fun first slide, but let's pick it up from here. The Code of Conduct is pretty

34
0:04:25,180 --> 0:04:29,540
 basic to Bornhack and it's actually one of the things that Jesper also helped out a lot

35
0:04:29,540 --> 0:04:34,060
 with. I forgot to mention that Morten from the NOC team stepped up and took Jesper's

36
0:04:34,060 --> 0:04:39,580
 place in the Code of Conduct team, so thank you also, Morten, for that. The Code of Conduct,

37
0:04:39,580 --> 0:04:43,900
 you probably have all seen it by now because it's taped to the inside of the toilet doors,

38
0:04:43,900 --> 0:04:49,620
 so it's pretty hard to miss. We take this seriously and we expect you to do the same.

39
0:04:49,620 --> 0:04:56,340
 It is about being nice to each other and respecting each other's personal space. It's a photo

40
0:04:56,340 --> 0:05:02,080
 policy and much more. Make sure you read it. Make sure you follow it. If you have questions,

41
0:05:02,080 --> 0:05:08,480
 we are available. There's a contact team that you can speak to and we usually don't have

42
0:05:08,480 --> 0:05:15,480
 to resort to any major Code of Conduct things. People are generally very, very nice to each

43
0:05:16,280 --> 0:05:22,000
 other here and we really appreciate that and we think and hope that that will continue,

44
0:05:22,000 --> 0:05:27,920
 of course, but the Code of Conduct is there to be a guideline in case some people have

45
0:05:27,960 --> 0:05:34,960
 questions about that. Reach out to the Conduct team, please.

46
0:05:37,120 --> 0:05:44,120
 Like I said, everybody who some people even showed up on the first day or second day,

47
0:05:44,840 --> 0:05:49,980
 so have been here almost a week along with the first organizers who arrived, it is such

48
0:05:49,980 --> 0:05:56,200
 a big job putting up all this stuff and the rain has not, the weather has not helped one

49
0:05:56,200 --> 0:06:01,720
 bit. It has been not only raining but very unstable, so occasionally raining and occasionally

50
0:06:01,720 --> 0:06:07,920
 very hot, so you have to change in and out of outfits every 10 seconds. It's been a lot

51
0:06:07,920 --> 0:06:12,560
 of work and to the people who take extra days off of work and stuff to come and help make

52
0:06:12,560 --> 0:06:17,880
 this happen and also in the other end who stay for the tear down and an extra special

53
0:06:17,880 --> 0:06:22,880
 big thank you. Can you please all stand up, people who helped with the build up so we

54
0:06:22,880 --> 0:06:29,880
 can see how many people there actually is.

55
0:06:45,200 --> 0:06:51,080
 Born Hackers like the bar always a work in progress and even though we have had a bit

56
0:06:51,080 --> 0:06:57,880
 more of a less stressful build up because we had a few more days and some stuff got

57
0:06:57,880 --> 0:07:03,560
 delivered and put up earlier than usual, so it's been a nice example of a build up the

58
0:07:03,560 --> 0:07:07,680
 way it should be and not too stressful and not too many long nights and stuff, but it

59
0:07:07,680 --> 0:07:12,280
 would be crazy to think that we have remembered everything and gotten everything done, so

60
0:07:12,280 --> 0:07:16,040
 there are still small things to do and there will be stuff that keeps popping up over the

61
0:07:16,040 --> 0:07:20,840
 week and stuff that we just plain forgot about. We'll put the jobs on the whiteboard

62
0:07:20,840 --> 0:07:25,720
 by the info desk, so if you come by and see something and think I can do that and I have

63
0:07:25,720 --> 0:07:31,280
 some time and I want to help out, then by all means please talk to the info desk or

64
0:07:31,280 --> 0:07:38,280
 somebody and if you need to or just do the job if it's easy to do.

65
0:07:39,020 --> 0:07:42,240
 If you see something wrong and you can't fix it, then please let us know. We will find

66
0:07:42,240 --> 0:07:49,240
 somebody who can fix it. I have a venue map at some point and the venue continually evolving

67
0:07:52,280 --> 0:07:56,800
 over the week is exemplified by, I made these slides two hours ago and the map is already

68
0:07:56,800 --> 0:08:02,720
 outdated, so bear with me on that. I'll try to explain what happened when we get to it,

69
0:08:02,720 --> 0:08:07,720
 but we are rolling with the punches and we'll make everything work, of course.

70
0:08:08,720 --> 0:08:11,720
 Oh, here it is. It's not terribly big, but...

71
0:08:23,720 --> 0:08:30,720
 I'll just use the colors. We are in the white square in the middle of the light blue triangle,

72
0:08:30,720 --> 0:08:36,720
 the general camping and this is the speaker stand. Across the road straight ahead is the

73
0:08:36,720 --> 0:08:43,720
 bar, it is hard to miss, it is a big colorful loud place with all the beers. We have north

74
0:08:45,080 --> 0:08:49,120
 east of this general camping and the pointy end, we have the caravans this year, they

75
0:08:49,120 --> 0:08:55,200
 moved to the other side of the road and across the road from them we have some more general

76
0:08:55,200 --> 0:09:02,200
 camping for attempts. On the other, between the bar and general camping is the auger area

77
0:09:03,120 --> 0:09:08,520
 with the info desk and all that. It is also the organizers personal village and where

78
0:09:08,520 --> 0:09:15,520
 we go to chill out and get away from people and like everybody needs to occasionally,

79
0:09:15,900 --> 0:09:22,160
 so please, unless you have something urgent, try to reach somebody in the info desk or

80
0:09:22,160 --> 0:09:29,160
 somewhere else and please stay out of the auger village as much as possible. Not that

81
0:09:29,840 --> 0:09:34,360
 we don't love you all, but we also have our stock of booze and everything in there, we

82
0:09:34,360 --> 0:09:41,360
 want to just keep it free of people. That is for us to drink, no.

83
0:09:45,880 --> 0:09:52,800
 So following the general, the central main road south, there is an entrance into the

84
0:09:52,800 --> 0:09:59,800
 food area and past the food area there is the noisy camping area, sorry, party camping

85
0:09:59,920 --> 0:10:06,040
 area, you don't have to be noisy down there. And on the other side of the road from that

86
0:10:06,040 --> 0:10:10,240
 is the cozy camping area which we introduced last year when we moved the speaker's tent

87
0:10:10,240 --> 0:10:15,280
 down here. It has turned out to be quite a nice little camping area and it is very popular

88
0:10:15,280 --> 0:10:21,400
 this year, it is nice to see. Going further up the road, there is a big shower and toilet

89
0:10:21,400 --> 0:10:26,920
 building, all the showers are down in the south end of the venue. There is a separate

90
0:10:26,920 --> 0:10:30,560
 building that has two showers and four toilets and inside the main building there is two

91
0:10:30,560 --> 0:10:36,520
 more showers and two more toilets and also there is two toilets down here by the bar.

92
0:10:36,520 --> 0:10:43,360
 That is the venue, if you have questions, oh, and the silent area, the neon or light

93
0:10:43,360 --> 0:10:48,800
 blue area in the top is the silent camping and the eastern part of that or maybe the

94
0:10:48,800 --> 0:10:52,880
 western part, it is not fully clear yet, will be converted to an extra caravan area because

95
0:10:52,880 --> 0:10:57,560
 we are kind of running out of space and there is ample space down there so we will kind

96
0:10:57,560 --> 0:11:04,560
 of remodel the venue a little bit last minute, forced by, well, we kind of estimated wrong,

97
0:11:06,160 --> 0:11:13,160
 I think how much room caravans take or something. Okay, the info desk is across the road from

98
0:11:13,720 --> 0:11:19,200
 yeah, and a bit down the road from where we are now. Many of you have probably been there

99
0:11:19,200 --> 0:11:23,320
 to get your wristband, you can come back to get more hacks, get some money if the bar

100
0:11:23,320 --> 0:11:30,000
 is not open, ask questions, pick up merchandise, pick up the badges when we get to that, they

101
0:11:30,000 --> 0:11:35,880
 will be ready soon, I think tomorrow or the day after or something. The team needs people

102
0:11:35,880 --> 0:11:41,680
 to help cover the shifts, it is not difficult work, you sit down and just help people and

103
0:11:41,680 --> 0:11:47,520
 they have a thorough interaction so most people should be able to do it and they really

104
0:11:47,520 --> 0:11:52,000
 need some help so please go to the info desk and ask them if you are interested in helping

105
0:11:52,000 --> 0:11:57,320
 out, they would love to be able to cover the shifts without having to work all of them

106
0:11:57,320 --> 0:12:04,320
 all the time. For those of you who haven't been here before,

107
0:12:05,280 --> 0:12:09,600
 we have something called hacks, you might have heard about it already, it is our internal

108
0:12:09,640 --> 0:12:15,840
 local currency, we packed it to the Danish Kroner so it is worth the same as the Danish

109
0:12:15,840 --> 0:12:21,680
 Kroner so if something costs 150 hacks it is the same as 150 Danish Kroner. They can

110
0:12:21,680 --> 0:12:26,760
 be bought at the info desk or at the bar when the bar is open or you can buy them online

111
0:12:26,760 --> 0:12:33,760
 and just buy them on the webshop and use the ticket in the bar or the info desk. You can

112
0:12:34,520 --> 0:12:37,640
 also use them at the food vendor, apart from the info desk and the bar, the food vendor

113
0:12:37,640 --> 0:12:44,640
 accepts them and they can basically be used like real money except the only way to buy

114
0:12:47,080 --> 0:12:51,640
 alcohol is with hacks, you cannot buy it with real money which is the main reason we have

115
0:12:51,640 --> 0:12:57,200
 them and so if you want to go to the bar and buy anything with any kind of alcohol in it

116
0:12:57,200 --> 0:13:00,840
 you will need to go get some hacks in the info desk to do that. They are these little

117
0:13:01,440 --> 0:13:08,440
 coloured coins, you will see them everywhere. If you ordered village tents or tables and

118
0:13:14,720 --> 0:13:19,120
 chairs and stuff, the tents you probably found, tables and chairs, if you still need to get

119
0:13:19,120 --> 0:13:23,560
 that you can go to the info desk, please coordinate with the info desk, don't just take stuff

120
0:13:23,560 --> 0:13:28,040
 because then we have no chance to keep track of it, it is not logged in, we know you can

121
0:13:28,040 --> 0:13:31,640
 just walk up and take it and we know you have paid for it and stuff but please coordinate

122
0:13:31,640 --> 0:13:36,760
 with us, it is really tricky to keep track of stuff when people just take it and tell

123
0:13:36,760 --> 0:13:43,760
 us in the bar at 1am, I took two chairs and four tables. So please go do it properly in

124
0:13:45,240 --> 0:13:51,760
 the info desk when they are open. We may have a few extra tables and chairs and benches,

125
0:13:51,760 --> 0:13:56,440
 go buy info tomorrow and check if we have any surplus, if you forgot to order or you

126
0:13:56,520 --> 0:14:03,520
 need some extras. We have electricity all over the venue thanks to the hard working

127
0:14:06,360 --> 0:14:13,360
 power team, they have rolled out more than a kilometre of the very heavy cables and the

128
0:14:13,760 --> 0:14:20,160
 power points are more or less all over the venue. Please keep them covered from the rain

129
0:14:20,160 --> 0:14:25,360
 so we don't have any outages because something got wet and if you see one without cover please

130
0:14:25,360 --> 0:14:29,720
 fix it yourself or notify somebody who can fix it, please don't just ignore it and leave

131
0:14:29,720 --> 0:14:35,080
 it and think somebody else will do it. Let's everybody help out and things will get fixed

132
0:14:35,080 --> 0:14:42,080
 much quicker and stop from breaking. There is an example here of it is not the biggest

133
0:14:42,720 --> 0:14:49,720
 picture but a happy looking power point, it has a bag over it and the bag is secured with

134
0:14:49,720 --> 0:14:56,720
 some pegs in the back, secured in the bag. It is cloth pegs, just the other kind of pegs.

135
0:15:06,640 --> 0:15:11,400
 Connect your cables if you need an adapter because we have the weird Danish standard

136
0:15:11,400 --> 0:15:18,040
 here, maybe we have some, do we have some in the info desk or not? I don't know actually,

137
0:15:18,040 --> 0:15:25,040
 ask somebody who knows. We don't. We will figure it out. Come ask us if you can get

138
0:15:27,520 --> 0:15:34,520
 power because things don't fit, we will make it fit somehow. Along the same lines the network

139
0:15:40,800 --> 0:15:46,920
 team have been working hard to get the network up and running, you can get gigabit ethernet

140
0:15:46,920 --> 0:15:51,600
 to your table, you can get wifi, you can even get a fibre link if you arrange it especially

141
0:15:51,600 --> 0:15:58,600
 with the network team. If you have special needs other than wifi you can absolutely get

142
0:15:59,280 --> 0:16:05,680
 that sorted. We have three SSIDs, the born hack net is the one that acts mostly like

143
0:16:05,680 --> 0:16:12,680
 a home internet connection, the born hack 802.1X is with 802.1X authentication fun enough

144
0:16:13,680 --> 0:16:20,680
 and the IPv6 one is with the modern IP family without the legacy, the IPv4 one. We get constant

145
0:16:24,480 --> 0:16:30,480
 requests to use more bandwidth and I guess that applies this year as well, does it not?

146
0:16:30,480 --> 0:16:37,480
 Great, so please use more bandwidth. The bar as you can see is progressing nicely, it is

147
0:16:37,480 --> 0:16:44,480
 always fascinating even to the people building it, how it is going to look, but to everybody

148
0:16:45,240 --> 0:16:50,240
 watching it during build up and in the first days so much happens and it becomes increasingly

149
0:16:50,240 --> 0:16:55,240
 more awesome as the days go by. Please use the bar, it is an important part of the money

150
0:16:55,240 --> 0:17:02,240
 that we use to make this event work, especially this year, we have been working on it for

151
0:17:02,240 --> 0:17:09,240
 a long time and it has been difficult to make ends meet so we have had to cut a few things.

152
0:17:17,600 --> 0:17:24,240
 The hot tub for example is not here this year, very sad to say, but we had to make some difficult

153
0:17:24,240 --> 0:17:28,080
 cuts here and there and that was one of the things that we had to take away. We hope it

154
0:17:28,160 --> 0:17:34,760
 will be back next year. Please use the bar, we absolutely depend on the profits from the

155
0:17:34,760 --> 0:17:41,760
 bar to make this whole thing work. We have a very nice selection of craft beer and booze

156
0:17:41,960 --> 0:17:48,000
 and can make cocktails and there is all the matter in the world, we might have slightly

157
0:17:48,000 --> 0:17:55,000
 overdone it on the matter this year so please.

158
0:17:59,080 --> 0:18:06,080
 There are many kinds and many bottles of each kind so that is great.

159
0:18:13,560 --> 0:18:18,920
 The bar has closing hours, we have a permit to sell booze from the authorities and that

160
0:18:18,920 --> 0:18:25,920
 ends at 2 a.m. every night so there are last rounds at 1.50, get your purchases in there,

161
0:18:26,360 --> 0:18:32,960
 get in line because we have to stop selling alcohol and the bar doesn't necessarily have

162
0:18:32,960 --> 0:18:38,400
 to shut down entirely but we cannot sell any more alcohol so buy your bottles and stuff

163
0:18:38,400 --> 0:18:45,400
 before 2 and then stick around.

164
0:18:45,400 --> 0:18:52,400
 That is thinking like a hacker. No, we better not play games with them but it opens when

165
0:19:02,760 --> 0:19:09,760
 the first bar staff wakes up the next day, usually around noon-ish I would say.

166
0:19:16,360 --> 0:19:22,480
 When we are a lot of people gathered we generate a lot of trash that is inevitable both from

167
0:19:22,480 --> 0:19:29,480
 food and drinks and everything and it is a lot of work handling trash from just a few

168
0:19:29,800 --> 0:19:35,040
 hundred people like we are, generates so much trash and so much deposit like empty bottles

169
0:19:35,040 --> 0:19:41,080
 and cans and stuff that we need to handle it properly from the beginning to not generate

170
0:19:41,320 --> 0:19:48,040
 massive amounts of work and also if it is not handled properly we get wasps and a thousand

171
0:19:48,040 --> 0:19:55,240
 nasty things as a result of not handling trash properly.

172
0:19:55,240 --> 0:19:59,480
 We have some trash cans around and there are signs on them, please look at the signs before

173
0:19:59,480 --> 0:20:06,480
 you put stuff in so you use the correct trash cans. We have five different ones, two of

174
0:20:06,480 --> 0:20:13,480
 them are for deposit, they have this circular logo thing, it is on the trash cans as well

175
0:20:13,760 --> 0:20:20,320
 and if the bottles have that you know the system from wherever you live and the deposit

176
0:20:20,320 --> 0:20:24,760
 cans and plastic bottles go in one container and the deposit glass bottles go in another

177
0:20:24,760 --> 0:20:29,800
 container. Apart from that there is a glass container for just like boost glass bottles

178
0:20:29,800 --> 0:20:34,720
 or whatever glass that does not have deposit and one for cardboard and finally one that

179
0:20:34,880 --> 0:20:41,320
 does not fit for all the trash that does not fit in any of the others. Is that pretty clear?

180
0:20:41,320 --> 0:20:45,240
 Two different kinds of deposit, one for cans and plastic bottles, one for glass and then

181
0:20:45,240 --> 0:20:51,440
 there is glass, cardboard and the rest. Ok? Fantastic. The people sorting it at the end

182
0:20:51,440 --> 0:20:58,440
 will send you happy thoughts forever if you do not generate too much sorting. As you can

183
0:20:58,760 --> 0:21:05,760
 imagine sorting three, four hundred people's deposit after a week or two is not fun work

184
0:21:06,640 --> 0:21:13,160
 so the less stuff that has been put in wrong, the less we have to sort, the better. So please

185
0:21:13,160 --> 0:21:18,640
 please spend the extra ten seconds, check the signs, put it in properly and please and

186
0:21:18,640 --> 0:21:25,640
 thank you from the sanitation team. Yes? Plastic what? Just general plastic that is used in

187
0:21:29,000 --> 0:21:35,000
 this municipality, they have not joined the rest of us in the 21st century. So it is not

188
0:21:35,000 --> 0:21:41,640
 for exposition? No, absolutely not. We would sort in ten kinds if we could but they are

189
0:21:41,640 --> 0:21:47,920
 just going to mix it all together when they pick it up anyway so there is no reason, sadly.

190
0:21:47,920 --> 0:21:52,160
 We hope next year we come back and see ten trash cans outside but we have been hoping

191
0:21:52,160 --> 0:21:59,160
 that for four years now, let's see when it happens. Sure, good question though. Ok, like

192
0:22:00,320 --> 0:22:06,680
 I mentioned we have had a rough time of it with sponsors this year but we have managed

193
0:22:06,680 --> 0:22:13,680
 to find some new sponsors and we are of course always tremendously grateful for all the support

194
0:22:14,120 --> 0:22:18,880
 we are getting, some sponsors pay cash and help just with the general finances of the

195
0:22:18,880 --> 0:22:24,800
 event, some lenders stuff that we would otherwise have to spend money on getting which is just

196
0:22:24,800 --> 0:22:31,800
 as good as getting money and it all helps out and even small sponsors that may not be

197
0:22:32,760 --> 0:22:39,760
 big companies and can't put in that much, it all helps because I would much rather have

198
0:22:41,080 --> 0:22:47,460
 five small sponsors than one big one if the amount is the same because it is just nicer.

199
0:22:47,460 --> 0:22:54,460
 So to all the sponsors, big and small, thank you to all the people who jumped in when

200
0:22:56,020 --> 0:23:00,980
 the shit hit the fan and we really needed to find new sponsors on pretty short notice.

201
0:23:00,980 --> 0:23:05,500
 Thank you all for jumping in to assist me and the others on the sponsors team and coming

202
0:23:05,500 --> 0:23:10,500
 with new leads. If any of you have an idea for an organisation that might want to help,

203
0:23:10,660 --> 0:23:17,660
 please send them my way or to watch the sponsors email and we can reach out to them. The absolute

204
0:23:18,940 --> 0:23:25,940
 most successful way to do it is if you know somebody who can make the decision about giving

205
0:23:26,060 --> 0:23:31,660
 some money or not and prepare them and then put us in contact with them. That method has

206
0:23:31,660 --> 0:23:37,260
 close to 100% success rate and just getting a contact, call this dude in this company

207
0:23:37,460 --> 0:23:43,220
 has close to 0% success rate. It is a massive difference. So if you know somebody, can go

208
0:23:43,220 --> 0:23:47,380
 poke your boss and say, hey, we should pay 10,000 to this event next year because they

209
0:23:47,380 --> 0:23:51,380
 are really cool and they help the community a lot and such and such. It helps us a lot

210
0:23:51,380 --> 0:23:58,380
 and it's barely any money in a company's budget for the whole year, almost no matter how small

211
0:23:58,740 --> 0:24:05,740
 a company, except ours. So thank you to all of you who helped find sponsors. I'll go through

212
0:24:06,220 --> 0:24:12,540
 them now and there will be their logos on the website and everything. We have a small

213
0:24:12,540 --> 0:24:18,740
 paper with badges this year that also have the sponsors logo on them. Please send them

214
0:24:18,740 --> 0:24:24,140
 your thanks and thoughts and use their services if you at all can. The big ones this year

215
0:24:24,140 --> 0:24:31,140
 are DKNOG, which is another event and full of lovely networking people and they stepped

216
0:24:31,460 --> 0:24:37,460
 in when they heard we were struggling and helped out a fellow event. Samdata is a big

217
0:24:37,460 --> 0:24:43,740
 labor union in Denmark that among other things has HK is a big labor union and Samdata is

218
0:24:43,740 --> 0:24:50,740
 the IT department for IT people and Sibyl Group is my employer that has lots of companies,

219
0:24:50,740 --> 0:24:57,740
 among others, the one where I'm employed called Mindfuture. Silver sponsors, Epson

220
0:25:11,780 --> 0:25:17,100
 has for the fourth year in a row, I think, sponsored this very nice video setup with

221
0:25:17,620 --> 0:25:24,060
 a high intensity brightness projector that works even when the sun is shining and the

222
0:25:24,060 --> 0:25:29,220
 weather is sweet. So thank you for that and that's a good example of something we would

223
0:25:29,220 --> 0:25:35,220
 have otherwise have to go out and rent and they are very expensive. Job Index and Sima4

224
0:25:35,220 --> 0:25:42,220
 are both new sponsors and thank you to those as well.

225
0:25:48,100 --> 0:25:54,340
 Among the sponsors are also Bornholm Spirits who continue to supply, we started out at

226
0:25:54,340 --> 0:25:58,700
 Bornholm but they continue to supply Saberblöder and other nice things for us at a very nice

227
0:25:58,700 --> 0:26:05,340
 price. FibreVue is providing the internet connection, not the fiber but the actual uplink

228
0:26:05,340 --> 0:26:12,340
 to the internet. Magenta PCBWay are sponsoring the PCBs for the batches and Ramion are sponsoring

229
0:26:12,340 --> 0:26:19,340
 speakers and Roskilde Auto and Skade Centre is sponsoring the shuttle car and the rest

230
0:26:23,020 --> 0:26:29,820
 are financial, no, TukTek is hosting sponsors for the Bornhack stuff. And the rest are financial

231
0:26:29,820 --> 0:26:36,820
 sponsors and thank you so much to them. There's a full year and a half to go and I think we

232
0:26:42,380 --> 0:26:48,160
 are now until the next Bornhack and a lot of the sponsor stuff takes some months to

233
0:26:48,160 --> 0:26:54,300
 settle and it's really tricky to do two weeks before Bornhack. So if you have an idea, get

234
0:26:54,300 --> 0:27:00,620
 started in the start of next year, not in June or July because it might be too late

235
0:27:00,620 --> 0:27:06,140
 for decision makers have gone on holiday and everything. So think spring is a good time

236
0:27:06,140 --> 0:27:13,140
 to be thinking about sponsors for Bornhack. Oh, that's quite the segue. So we are in an

237
0:27:16,260 --> 0:27:23,140
 area that sometimes has, well, it all the time has ticks and sometimes they latch onto

238
0:27:23,140 --> 0:27:29,340
 people and sit down by the ankles or in humid places on the body. They are nasty, they can

239
0:27:29,340 --> 0:27:35,980
 sometimes rarely but occasionally have a disease and it can infect people and can get

240
0:27:35,980 --> 0:27:41,280
 really nasty. So if you discover a tick, get it removed as soon as possible. We have tick

241
0:27:41,280 --> 0:27:48,280
 removers in the info desk and SIRT can help remove them. It can be difficult to check.

242
0:27:48,780 --> 0:27:53,360
 It's the back of the knees and weird places. Have a friend help you in the tent, might

243
0:27:53,360 --> 0:28:00,360
 be fun. Make sure you check when you are in the shower and if you feel that might be,

244
0:28:09,800 --> 0:28:14,920
 they are very, very small. They can look like just a little piece of dirt. Some of them

245
0:28:14,920 --> 0:28:21,920
 incredibly tiny. So make sure you keep an eye out for those little fuckers.

246
0:28:23,520 --> 0:28:30,520
 Okay, bicycles. The info desk is the place to go if you need to ride a bike somewhere,

247
0:28:30,520 --> 0:28:37,200
 maybe go shopping or maybe just go for a nice ride around in nature or whatever you need.

248
0:28:37,200 --> 0:28:42,320
 We have helmets and locks and lights and stuff for them. Different sizes. There's a few children's

249
0:28:42,320 --> 0:28:48,320
 bikes too and there's a trailer or two as well. They are free still. This is one of

250
0:28:48,320 --> 0:28:52,580
 the things we considered introducing a payment for when we were, because we are struggling

251
0:28:52,580 --> 0:28:58,140
 a bit financially. Instead we suggest a small donation to cover the cost but they are free

252
0:28:58,140 --> 0:29:05,140
 but please consider donating something if you take a bike.

253
0:29:06,200 --> 0:29:10,540
 The parking lot, most of you arrived by car so you will have noticed the parking lot.

254
0:29:10,540 --> 0:29:17,540
 I just wanted to mention please park sensibly and like don't, goes without saying, don't

255
0:29:18,500 --> 0:29:22,220
 double park and don't park so other people can't get out. There's plenty of room down

256
0:29:22,220 --> 0:29:29,220
 there for all the tickets we sold if people park sensibly. Last year we had, I don't know,

257
0:29:29,780 --> 0:29:33,520
 two years ago, an annoying incident where we had to run around and find somebody who

258
0:29:33,520 --> 0:29:38,280
 was parked so other people couldn't get out. So please consider everybody when you put

259
0:29:38,280 --> 0:29:43,960
 your car down. If there's any issues in the parking lot, please notify the info desk.

260
0:29:43,960 --> 0:29:50,560
 We don't necessarily know because we're not, not all of us are driving around. We arrive

261
0:29:50,560 --> 0:29:56,480
 here and then we leave two weeks later. So we might not notice. So please notify us if

262
0:29:56,480 --> 0:30:03,480
 there's something with the driving plates or someone is parked badly or something.

263
0:30:04,120 --> 0:30:11,120
 If you ordered T-shirts, hoodies and merchandise, it will be produced during the week and when

264
0:30:14,460 --> 0:30:20,480
 it's ready we'll announce it and you can pick it up in the info desk. It is being produced

265
0:30:20,480 --> 0:30:24,960
 by, yeah, Floma and a few other volunteers. We're doing a lot of work for it and it's

266
0:30:24,960 --> 0:30:31,960
 always such nice merchandise we get. So thank you for all the work you're doing.

267
0:30:33,480 --> 0:30:40,480
 Badges. This year's badge is NFC focused. It consists of two badges actually. There's

268
0:30:47,080 --> 0:30:52,500
 a reader which is the active part that has the computer and a tag which is a passive

269
0:30:52,500 --> 0:30:57,480
 thing that can be read with the active part. It's a very cool setup and it enables a lot

270
0:30:57,480 --> 0:31:04,280
 of fun NFC hacking and we hope to see some cool things, cool applications of it.

271
0:31:04,280 --> 0:31:10,960
 As mentioned quite a few times by now, we are kind of broke and other events have charged

272
0:31:10,960 --> 0:31:17,320
 for badges for a while and we've never done that because we kind of feel that we would

273
0:31:17,320 --> 0:31:22,360
 love for this to just be a part of the ticket. We haven't announced this earlier because

274
0:31:22,560 --> 0:31:27,160
 we've been trying to secure sponsors to make it fully free. That has not been possible.

275
0:31:27,160 --> 0:31:34,160
 A badge is 100 hacks. If you have a full week ticket then you have QR code in the same PDF

276
0:31:34,320 --> 0:31:40,080
 as your ticket and you can use that to get a badge for 100 hacks. If you want additional

277
0:31:40,080 --> 0:31:44,000
 badges or you are here on a one day ticket or you want one to take home to a friend or

278
0:31:44,000 --> 0:31:51,000
 something it's 150 hacks. Hopefully next year we can go back to the full week tickets including

279
0:31:51,280 --> 0:31:57,160
 badge enterprise. Sadly this was the best we could do this year. The badges will be

280
0:31:57,160 --> 0:32:04,160
 presented tomorrow. Thank you. The badges will be presented tomorrow at 1300 by Flummer

281
0:32:11,240 --> 0:32:16,040
 from the badge team who will talk about the design and what it can do and I'm sure there

282
0:32:16,040 --> 0:32:23,040
 will be a lot of fun things about it. I wanted to include a picture but I didn't have time.

283
0:32:23,360 --> 0:32:30,360
 They look fantastically cool. I'm looking forward to seeing them all around the venue.

284
0:32:32,400 --> 0:32:39,400
 We still have a few teams that need members. The info team is continuously onboarding new

285
0:32:39,520 --> 0:32:43,980
 people. They always need people to set up there. Sometimes they have to sit two or three

286
0:32:43,980 --> 0:32:50,980
 people to manage the load. It just takes a lot of volunteers to keep the info desk open.

287
0:32:51,980 --> 0:32:58,420
 The video team manages this stuff right here. Makes sure stuff is recorded and streamed

288
0:32:58,420 --> 0:33:02,820
 and we can watch the recordings later or at least sit in the tents and watch the streams

289
0:33:02,820 --> 0:33:07,660
 live. Not everything is recorded. Please make sure you note in the program if there's a

290
0:33:07,660 --> 0:33:11,820
 little recording icon or not and if not you have to be present here if you want to see

291
0:33:11,820 --> 0:33:15,680
 it. The stuff that's being recorded, if you're prevented from seeing it, you can catch it

292
0:33:15,680 --> 0:33:22,680
 later on the stream. If you want to join the video team, there's an onboarding meeting

293
0:33:23,820 --> 0:33:30,120
 tomorrow Thursday at noon here in the speaker's tent. They have a very thorough onboarding

294
0:33:30,120 --> 0:33:36,820
 and it looks a bit intimidating, all the equipment, but it is easy to do and you get a first row

295
0:33:36,820 --> 0:33:43,820
 seat for the talks and we would appreciate help with that. The sanitation team colloquially

296
0:33:45,260 --> 0:33:52,100
 team shit handles, they do not clean toilets, might occasionally unclog one, but cleaning

297
0:33:52,100 --> 0:33:58,900
 is handled by an external cleaning company, but they handle stuff like making sure there's

298
0:33:58,900 --> 0:34:05,900
 hand paper towels and soap and stuff in the toilets and the trash being emptied and put

299
0:34:06,220 --> 0:34:11,740
 in the container and the deposit bags being emptied and stuff like that. So it's handling

300
0:34:11,740 --> 0:34:17,340
 all the waste, but not actually cleaning toilets. We have people for that. They're also onboarding

301
0:34:17,340 --> 0:34:22,660
 continuously and you can go to the info desk and speak to Anke, I guess, if you're interested

302
0:34:22,660 --> 0:34:28,020
 in joining. On the website there's a list of teams and you can see there which ones

303
0:34:28,020 --> 0:34:35,020
 still need members. We've also, as a new initiative started, a daily volunteer meeting, which

304
0:34:36,220 --> 0:34:41,460
 every day at 1400. It is in the start tent across from the info desk and it is an attempt

305
0:34:41,460 --> 0:34:47,140
 to keep some of the awesome communication going. We've had, during build up, we have

306
0:34:47,140 --> 0:34:53,340
 meetings after each meal and we have breakfast, lunch and dinner prepared by Jonathan, which

307
0:34:53,340 --> 0:34:58,500
 is always fantastic, and after that we have a talk about what needs to be done and people

308
0:34:58,500 --> 0:35:03,100
 put out their hands and go do stuff. And that kind of stops when the event starts because

309
0:35:03,300 --> 0:35:07,180
 we lose contact to all the volunteers. We don't have these regular meetings anymore.

310
0:35:07,180 --> 0:35:14,020
 And we want to remedy that by doing this daily volunteer meetup at 1400. Everybody, you don't

311
0:35:14,020 --> 0:35:18,740
 have to be on a team. If you don't have anything to do, if you want to help out, show up at

312
0:35:18,740 --> 0:35:25,740
 the start tent across from the info desk. One of the recurring themes will be, since

313
0:35:25,740 --> 0:35:30,740
 we are a bit broke this year, we could not afford as much cleaning as we normally can,

314
0:35:30,740 --> 0:35:35,220
 so the food area will not be cleaned for us. We have to do that ourselves. And one of the

315
0:35:35,220 --> 0:35:39,140
 things we will do every day at two is to take a bunch of volunteers, go down there, do the

316
0:35:39,140 --> 0:35:45,940
 tornado, make it look really nice, and hopefully we can keep it going. You are also, of course,

317
0:35:45,940 --> 0:35:50,180
 all required to clean up after yourself. When you use the food area, when you cook, when

318
0:35:50,180 --> 0:35:55,860
 you do dishes, if you spill something, please fix it yourself. It's not necessary to say,

319
0:35:55,860 --> 0:36:01,220
 but we know that when many people use a kitchen, no matter how careful everybody is, there's

320
0:36:01,220 --> 0:36:06,020
 going to be spills and stuff that needs cleaning. And since there are no cleaners doing it,

321
0:36:06,020 --> 0:36:12,540
 we have to do it ourselves. If you see something, clean it up. Absolutely. That would be fantastic.

322
0:36:12,540 --> 0:36:18,300
 But we are planning to take a team of people once a day and give it the once over so it

323
0:36:18,300 --> 0:36:23,140
 stays nice and inviting to use. So if you feel like helping out with that and other

324
0:36:23,140 --> 0:36:29,380
 stuff that pops up, it will be every day at 1400 in the volunteer tent. We hope to see

325
0:36:29,380 --> 0:36:37,500
 many people and we are excited to introduce this new. We think it's going to be a great

326
0:36:37,500 --> 0:36:42,020
 addition to an already great event.

327
0:36:42,020 --> 0:36:54,500
 CERT are here to take care of us in case something happens. It is our medic team. They can take

328
0:36:54,500 --> 0:37:03,300
 care of small and big things like ticks or small cuts or worse. We haven't had much of

329
0:37:03,300 --> 0:37:09,020
 the worse, but we have people to handle it in case it happens. We have a hard starter.

330
0:37:09,020 --> 0:37:15,220
 We have first aid kits. We have educated people who have been in situations where they have

331
0:37:15,220 --> 0:37:21,980
 to take care of people before. And we are in good hands. They are wearing orange vests.

332
0:37:21,980 --> 0:37:29,020
 They can be called on the radio. You can call the born hack phone. If you have a deck phone,

333
0:37:29,020 --> 0:37:34,940
 then you can call 112 on the deck phone. There's a lot of ways to get in touch with them. And

334
0:37:34,940 --> 0:37:41,620
 they will also be visible on the side. There's always 24 hours, a CERT person on duty. They need

335
0:37:41,620 --> 0:37:48,500
 more people, if I recall correctly. Yes. And they have a team meeting Thursday, that's tomorrow

336
0:37:48,500 --> 0:37:59,260
 at 11 in the cabin. I can't see if you're nodding. Yes. Thank you. In the cabin. And they need

337
0:37:59,260 --> 0:38:07,540
 members, yes. You don't have to be trained anything, but it of course helps if you are.

338
0:38:07,540 --> 0:38:20,540
 Photo team will wear white vests. They are recognizable for a good reason. We have a code

339
0:38:20,540 --> 0:38:25,940
 of conduct, like I mentioned, and one of the important or one of the parts of it, they are

340
0:38:25,940 --> 0:38:32,180
 important, is that you're not allowed to take pictures at born hack unless everybody, all people

341
0:38:32,180 --> 0:38:39,940
 in the photo agree to the photo being taken. This means I cannot take a crowd photo here. It would

342
0:38:39,940 --> 0:38:46,020
 take forever to ask everybody. Well, I have a microphone. But still, generally, you can't

343
0:38:46,020 --> 0:38:51,820
 take crowd pictures. It's tricky and it's sad. But we have to protect people's privacy and

344
0:38:51,820 --> 0:39:08,100
 prioritize that over people's desire to take cool pictures of crowds. We do, however, want to see

345
0:39:08,100 --> 0:39:14,380
 cool pictures. And that is quite the dilemma. So we have a photo team. They all know, well,

346
0:39:14,380 --> 0:39:21,740
 you all know the code of conduct because you've used the toilets, but they know a lot of people

347
0:39:21,740 --> 0:39:26,900
 here personally. They know who they can take pictures of and who has already said no. And if

348
0:39:26,900 --> 0:39:31,220
 they see new people, they might come and ask, is it okay to take a picture here? You are free to say

349
0:39:31,220 --> 0:39:36,820
 no and stay where you are. You are free to say no and step out and the photographer can take the

350
0:39:36,820 --> 0:39:44,260
 picture, make it work somehow. But they are visible in white vests and, of course, a piece of huge

351
0:39:44,260 --> 0:39:50,740
 optics around their neck. And they will ask permissions for pictures. And if you feel like a

352
0:39:50,740 --> 0:39:57,180
 picture has been taken where you weren't asked or maybe you were in it or you are not sure, you are

353
0:39:57,180 --> 0:40:01,580
 very welcome to go ask the photographer to see the pictures and browse through. And if you feel

354
0:40:01,580 --> 0:40:07,780
 like you are on one of them, then it can be deleted. But it shouldn't happen. They are careful and

355
0:40:07,780 --> 0:40:11,460
 they know what they are doing. I'm not sure. Does the photo team need more people?

356
0:40:11,460 --> 0:40:18,380
 Yes, everybody is welcome.

357
0:40:18,380 --> 0:40:24,540
 So if you like taking pictures and this sounds like something you could and would do, then talk

358
0:40:24,540 --> 0:40:34,380
 to Tobias and he can introduce you to the whole thing. There's a meeting tomorrow at noon. Is it also in the

359
0:40:34,380 --> 0:40:45,460
 cabin? Also in the cabin. Great. The game team has prepared a token game again this year. The tokens

360
0:40:45,460 --> 0:40:52,700
 are little text strings. They are hidden around the venue, offline and online, on physical signs

361
0:40:52,700 --> 0:40:59,700
 or it could be on servers or networks, all kinds of things. There are hints in your profile on the

362
0:40:59,700 --> 0:41:09,020
 website. And I think they will keep adding tokens throughout the week. And the hunt is usually great.

363
0:41:09,020 --> 0:41:15,340
 The hunt is usually competitive and fun and it's kind of like a treasure hunt for nerds all around

364
0:41:15,340 --> 0:41:20,700
 the venue. It is a great tradition and I hope many of you will play. I know the game team has put a

365
0:41:20,700 --> 0:41:34,220
 lot of work into it. The last slide is just a thank you to the volunteers. This event would not be

366
0:41:34,220 --> 0:41:42,380
 possible without the volunteers. That goes without saying. We are 11 people in the group and it would

367
0:41:42,380 --> 0:41:48,740
 absolutely not be possible to do all this without 30 or 40 people helping out with carrying stuff

368
0:41:48,740 --> 0:41:55,820
 around and helping us with our crazy ideas. And hey, we want to build a weird thing here, can you?

369
0:41:55,820 --> 0:42:00,980
 And people just run over and start building. It's just fantastic to be around people with this kind

370
0:42:00,980 --> 0:42:06,220
 of drive and this kind of passion. And it's so nice that you throw that drive and that passion

371
0:42:06,220 --> 0:42:11,580
 towards helping us make this event even more fantastic. So again, thank you all.

372
0:42:18,740 --> 0:42:29,460
 Please consider showing up for the meetings at 1400. We've been a bit cheeky and added it to the schedule

373
0:42:29,460 --> 0:42:36,580
 so it will show up in your gigaday and in your feed readers and your calendars and stuff. So give it a try,

374
0:42:36,580 --> 0:42:44,900
 show up if you have nothing else to do. I added this slide in case I thought of something to say while I was talking,

375
0:42:44,900 --> 0:42:55,060
 but I haven't. So I don't think I have anything else. But if any team leads may have comments or stuff

376
0:42:55,060 --> 0:42:59,140
 I forgot to include that would be relevant to include now, then we can do that.

377
0:43:01,980 --> 0:43:03,980
 We are getting a microphone, just a second.

378
0:43:14,900 --> 0:43:19,900
 Is there a regular Bonhack network?

379
0:43:19,900 --> 0:43:27,900
 Is there? Oh, I didn't see. Oh, sorry. There's four SSIDs and one of them is just called Bonhack

380
0:43:27,900 --> 0:43:35,220
 and it's a plain old public B4 and B6. You get a real IP address, make sure your firewalls is properly configured

381
0:43:35,220 --> 0:43:38,900
 because that's like going on the old school internet back in the 90s.

382
0:43:44,900 --> 0:43:51,900
 If you collected your footage here, this is on. It's supposed to be. It's not.

383
0:43:51,900 --> 0:44:00,900
 If you collected your footage here from the pedestrian area and you had a dark chair, the white plastic one,

384
0:44:00,900 --> 0:44:07,900
 but accidentally took the hold of one, one was sitting on it and the other was on the floor.

385
0:44:07,900 --> 0:44:17,900
 Oh, damn. Okay. I'll repeat because the audio was a bit low. If you ordered village gear and you ordered the black upholstered chairs,

386
0:44:17,900 --> 0:44:23,900
 no, sorry, you ordered the white garden chairs and accidentally instead took the black upholstered chairs,

387
0:44:23,900 --> 0:44:32,900
 please bring them back because we need them. The people who actually ordered them need them and come back and get some white garden chairs instead.

388
0:44:32,900 --> 0:44:39,900
 Basically the garden chairs, the white ones are good for the grass and the other ones are good for when you have a floor in your tent.

389
0:44:39,900 --> 0:44:47,900
 It's kind of late to change now because we can't change the order, but if you did get the upholstered chairs

390
0:44:47,900 --> 0:44:54,900
 and you have those on your receipt and you know what I'm saying. If you took the wrong chairs, please bring them back. Thank you.

391
0:44:56,900 --> 0:44:58,900
 Any other questions?

392
0:45:03,900 --> 0:45:13,900
 Oh, that's a very good question. The Hacker Jeopardy will be on tomorrow and then again Saturday and again Monday for the finals.

393
0:45:13,900 --> 0:45:20,900
 Sign-ups is to info at bornhack.dk by mail. We already got the first sign up a few days before the event

394
0:45:20,900 --> 0:45:31,900
 and we always, the game team always needs more categories. If you've played Hacker Jeopardy before or been a spectator,

395
0:45:31,900 --> 0:45:37,900
 you know what this is about. It is find a fun category, find some questions that are not too difficult.

396
0:45:37,900 --> 0:45:46,900
 The one trap people always falls in is like, okay, I'm an expert on this. I'll make a category so difficult that I'm the only person in the room who can answer it.

397
0:45:46,900 --> 0:45:52,900
 And that's just not a lot of fun to other people than the person who knows all the answers.

398
0:45:52,900 --> 0:46:04,900
 What we want is categories that go from the most difficult one, maybe 25% knows it and the easiest one, almost everybody knows it and it's a chase for the buttons.

399
0:46:04,900 --> 0:46:11,900
 It has to be, it's much more fun that way. Trust us, we've tried both ways and take our words for it.

400
0:46:11,900 --> 0:46:15,900
 So please send categories. Is there a...

401
0:46:15,900 --> 0:46:21,900
 Game-team at bornhack.dk

402
0:46:21,900 --> 0:46:28,900
 and send your categories or send questions. If you don't know quite how to formulate it, they will be happy to get you started.

403
0:46:28,900 --> 0:46:40,900
 If you're playing and you submitted a category, please let us know the day you're on so we don't accidentally schedule your own questions when you're playing.

404
0:46:40,900 --> 0:46:42,900
 Yeah, yes?

405
0:46:42,900 --> 0:46:50,900
 I missed the POC in this one. It would be fun to say that that is working now.

406
0:46:50,900 --> 0:46:57,900
 For the first time in a few years, we have a working DEC network. Thank you to the POC team for getting that up and running.

407
0:46:57,900 --> 0:47:16,900
 This means you can go to the website, register a phone number in the phonebook there with your account and then you get an activation code, you dial that on your DEC phone and you are rolling.

408
0:47:16,900 --> 0:47:25,900
 It's easy and it's fucking awesome and I'm looking forward to getting my own phones hooked up as soon as I don't have a million other things to do.

409
0:47:25,900 --> 0:47:32,900
 So, any more questions? I can't really see. There's one down there.

410
0:47:32,900 --> 0:47:35,900
 You forgot to give a hand to the hookah team.

411
0:47:49,900 --> 0:47:51,900
 Thank you.

412
0:47:55,900 --> 0:48:05,900
 Thank you. We love you too.

413
0:48:05,900 --> 0:48:12,900
 We forgot to say you can spot the organizers from these very snazzy latest fashion black vests that we're wearing this year.

414
0:48:12,900 --> 0:48:21,900
 So, black vests for Orga, white vests for Photo Team, orange for SIRT and the yellow vest is other volunteers.

415
0:48:21,900 --> 0:48:27,900
 So, that's the color scheme for this year, hopefully going forward.

416
0:48:27,900 --> 0:48:37,900
 Okay, fantastic. We got through it in under an hour. That's a new record and I almost didn't cry and we're pretty good.

417
0:48:37,900 --> 0:48:39,900
 See you at the bar!

418
0:48:39,900 --> 0:48:44,900
 Yes, exactly. See you all at the bar. Thank you for everything.
