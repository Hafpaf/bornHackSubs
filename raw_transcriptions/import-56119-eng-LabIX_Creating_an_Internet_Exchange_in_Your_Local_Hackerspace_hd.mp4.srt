# Transcribed 2023-11-10 with medium model size

1
0:00:00,000 --> 0:00:10,560
 You can also find information on how an instant exchange operates.

2
0:00:10,560 --> 0:00:11,560
 There's some information.

3
0:00:11,560 --> 0:00:16,880
 There's a very high level and doesn't really explain too much.

4
0:00:16,880 --> 0:00:22,880
 And then there's also the administration of talking to ripe and what objects do you need

5
0:00:22,880 --> 0:00:26,640
 and how do you get IP addresses and stuff like that.

6
0:00:26,640 --> 0:00:28,480
 That's many policies included.

7
0:00:28,480 --> 0:00:35,040
 And yes, I wrote everything as an acronym group because that's pretty much what it is.

8
0:00:35,040 --> 0:00:41,280
 So LabX is a community-run instant exchange.

9
0:00:41,280 --> 0:00:48,680
 We made this because I like BGP and network routing.

10
0:00:48,680 --> 0:00:51,000
 And I would like to play more with it.

11
0:00:51,000 --> 0:00:54,840
 So in LaboSat we have a facility called LabiColor.

12
0:00:54,840 --> 0:00:58,200
 We will get more into that at some point.

13
0:00:58,200 --> 0:01:03,840
 But we offer a service called a route server.

14
0:01:03,840 --> 0:01:06,880
 Again, I will get more into it.

15
0:01:06,880 --> 0:01:17,120
 What that is, we can assist you in how should you talk to a local internet registry to get

16
0:01:17,120 --> 0:01:19,680
 an AS number and IP addresses.

17
0:01:19,680 --> 0:01:24,920
 You can actually start looking into real network routing stuff and not just play with it in

18
0:01:24,920 --> 0:01:27,560
 a virtual machine.

19
0:01:27,560 --> 0:01:36,760
 You can do BGP stuff, security and research and build on what is RPKI and things like

20
0:01:36,760 --> 0:01:37,760
 this.

21
0:01:37,760 --> 0:01:41,760
 Also, yes, I wrote 9KMTU.

22
0:01:41,760 --> 0:01:45,600
 We don't have that currently but we will soon set it up to 9KMTU.

23
0:01:45,600 --> 0:01:49,600
 It's currently 1,500 like most.

24
0:01:49,600 --> 0:01:52,520
 So what is an internet exchange?

25
0:01:52,520 --> 0:02:00,360
 Well, it's a VLAN on a little switch and then some networks are connected to it.

26
0:02:00,360 --> 0:02:03,480
 Well, that doesn't really say much.

27
0:02:03,480 --> 0:02:07,400
 So let me explain what is the internet.

28
0:02:07,400 --> 0:02:13,560
 First, this is how we do internet routing or network routing.

29
0:02:13,560 --> 0:02:15,720
 We have some prefixes.

30
0:02:15,720 --> 0:02:18,520
 You find a facility that would like to host you.

31
0:02:18,520 --> 0:02:22,280
 That includes some power and cooling and stuff like that.

32
0:02:22,280 --> 0:02:23,480
 You install your machines.

33
0:02:23,480 --> 0:02:24,480
 You set up a routing daemon.

34
0:02:24,480 --> 0:02:30,680
 It could be like BERT if you use Linux or other things.

35
0:02:30,680 --> 0:02:37,080
 Then you have some peers that are other network operators.

36
0:02:37,080 --> 0:02:40,640
 And you will PO them to get their content.

37
0:02:40,640 --> 0:02:48,040
 And then you also need a transit uplink, which is how do you, well, now you're in facility

38
0:02:48,120 --> 0:02:52,120
 with, and you can connect with the other people in that facility, but how do you connect with

39
0:02:52,120 --> 0:02:53,120
 the rest of the world?

40
0:02:53,120 --> 0:02:58,040
 We're not Copenhagen, it doesn't contain the whole internet.

41
0:02:58,040 --> 0:03:06,960
 So you need a transit that says we will like to transport the traffic from your network

42
0:03:06,960 --> 0:03:09,280
 or to the station.

43
0:03:09,280 --> 0:03:11,800
 And profit, I guess.

44
0:03:11,800 --> 0:03:15,160
 So let's set a scenario.

45
0:03:15,160 --> 0:03:16,540
 You are an ISP.

46
0:03:16,540 --> 0:03:22,780
 You are currently located in Hygge Damm, coincidentally where we are.

47
0:03:22,780 --> 0:03:28,060
 And an eyeball ISP is that we have some customers with eyeballs.

48
0:03:28,060 --> 0:03:33,980
 They consume content that could be watching their favorite series or watching the news

49
0:03:33,980 --> 0:03:37,980
 or somehow get content.

50
0:03:37,980 --> 0:03:42,140
 You don't host servers necessarily.

51
0:03:42,140 --> 0:03:57,020
 So for you to be able to have to say, like, when a customer wants to connect to another

52
0:03:57,020 --> 0:04:01,100
 provider to get content, you need some IP addresses.

53
0:04:01,100 --> 0:04:07,580
 That is, well, hopefully most of you know, some is like an address, like postal address

54
0:04:07,580 --> 0:04:10,060
 where do the thing need to go?

55
0:04:10,060 --> 0:04:13,860
 You also need that for your servers.

56
0:04:13,860 --> 0:04:18,300
 Then you need housing and fiber stuff.

57
0:04:18,300 --> 0:04:22,300
 I won't go into the fiber stuff.

58
0:04:22,300 --> 0:04:28,740
 I don't dig too much into layer one things, only layer three in this case.

59
0:04:28,740 --> 0:04:35,180
 So how does the network connect with other networks?

60
0:04:35,180 --> 0:04:38,300
 You probably cannot see my mouse.

61
0:04:38,300 --> 0:04:44,620
 So we have in the left, it's called, well, in this case, called ACME.

62
0:04:44,620 --> 0:04:46,420
 This is one network provider.

63
0:04:46,420 --> 0:04:53,740
 What if ACME is ACME 1 and ACME 2 are not located in the same city and the same facility?

64
0:04:53,740 --> 0:04:59,400
 Well, in our lovely picture here, we have two transit providers that need to go through

65
0:04:59,400 --> 0:05:02,400
 first.

66
0:05:02,400 --> 0:05:08,840
 So there's Comcast and there's GDT, which are some providers in the world that exist.

67
0:05:08,840 --> 0:05:12,040
 And then we can go into ACME number two.

68
0:05:12,040 --> 0:05:22,000
 That could be where all the nice series are hosted or similar.

69
0:05:22,000 --> 0:05:27,280
 It could also be that what if ACME 1 and 2 are located in the same city, they're just

70
0:05:27,280 --> 0:05:30,760
 not really connected.

71
0:05:30,760 --> 0:05:33,460
 And it would be perhaps too expensive to connect them.

72
0:05:33,460 --> 0:05:37,120
 So let's look at what is an autonomous system.

73
0:05:37,120 --> 0:05:41,200
 It says AS1 and AS2 here.

74
0:05:41,200 --> 0:05:43,000
 Something, something, something.

75
0:05:43,000 --> 0:05:50,940
 In other words, so we have a lovely RFC that describes AS as a connected group of one or

76
0:05:50,940 --> 0:05:56,240
 more prefixes run by one or more network operators, which has a single and clearly defined routing

77
0:05:56,240 --> 0:05:58,800
 policy.

78
0:05:58,800 --> 0:06:01,000
 I can explain a tiny bit more on that.

79
0:06:01,000 --> 0:06:06,160
 But it is the most clear explanation I have found until now.

80
0:06:06,160 --> 0:06:08,920
 So that's why it's here.

81
0:06:08,920 --> 0:06:15,640
 So an AS is an organization, as I said.

82
0:06:15,640 --> 0:06:26,480
 And we have, we use what we call AS numbers or ASMs to identify an organization that could

83
0:06:26,560 --> 0:06:31,440
 be your friends in the other side of the facility.

84
0:06:31,440 --> 0:06:37,120
 And they have some, well, you and the other ASs have some prefixes allocated to them so

85
0:06:37,120 --> 0:06:44,800
 you know where the content should go or the traffic should go.

86
0:06:44,800 --> 0:06:55,520
 So the routing policy, well, it's found in databases, regional internet database like

87
0:06:55,520 --> 0:06:59,720
 RAPES database.

88
0:06:59,720 --> 0:07:08,060
 These routing policies say something like I have authorized to use these IP prefixes

89
0:07:08,060 --> 0:07:15,800
 and they should, so now see IP prefixes at all traffic to these prefixes should be distant

90
0:07:15,800 --> 0:07:16,800
 to me.

91
0:07:16,800 --> 0:07:21,320
 And it could also be that you have some customers that may be a little bit more fancy with their

92
0:07:21,320 --> 0:07:23,920
 networking.

93
0:07:23,920 --> 0:07:31,160
 And they would also like to announce through you, so you are that transit.

94
0:07:31,160 --> 0:07:37,680
 And that could be some business customers, for example, or in our case, Labitat or me

95
0:07:37,680 --> 0:07:41,960
 where Labitat is my optic.

96
0:07:41,960 --> 0:07:50,200
 I have included a lot of places, links to things that can be read more on since I found

97
0:07:50,280 --> 0:07:55,600
 these useful, I have left them in.

98
0:07:55,600 --> 0:07:57,520
 So peering and transit.

99
0:07:57,520 --> 0:08:04,440
 Well, first peering is that we agree it's free to both of us.

100
0:08:04,440 --> 0:08:09,400
 There is some optics, fibers included and things like cross connect where you have to

101
0:08:09,400 --> 0:08:15,440
 like you are looking at a data center and you would like to connect to the other side

102
0:08:15,440 --> 0:08:16,440
 of the data center.

103
0:08:16,440 --> 0:08:18,560
 And it takes a bit of money for that.

104
0:08:18,560 --> 0:08:22,920
 It costs usually some X amount per month.

105
0:08:22,920 --> 0:08:25,680
 We only send traffic to each other.

106
0:08:25,680 --> 0:08:28,440
 That is totally fine.

107
0:08:28,440 --> 0:08:36,840
 As long as we don't tip the balance where I send a lot of traffic to you and you don't

108
0:08:36,840 --> 0:08:38,880
 send that much traffic to me.

109
0:08:38,880 --> 0:08:39,880
 But it's fine.

110
0:08:39,880 --> 0:08:42,040
 We peer with a lot of people.

111
0:08:42,040 --> 0:08:43,680
 Then we also have transit.

112
0:08:43,720 --> 0:08:47,720
 So transit is where it costs per megabit.

113
0:08:47,720 --> 0:08:54,240
 And this I will transport traffic from you to other networks.

114
0:08:54,240 --> 0:08:58,320
 As I always said, if you want to go to the other side of the globe, you perhaps don't

115
0:08:58,320 --> 0:09:02,560
 have the funds to lay a cable over the Atlantic or something similar.

116
0:09:02,560 --> 0:09:06,520
 So someone has done that for you and you would just pay them.

117
0:09:06,520 --> 0:09:12,080
 Well, what is the instant exchange then?

118
0:09:12,080 --> 0:09:15,560
 We keep local traffic local.

119
0:09:15,560 --> 0:09:18,880
 We avoid what we call the trombone effect.

120
0:09:18,880 --> 0:09:29,080
 This is an image of the United States, San Francisco, New York and Los Angeles.

121
0:09:29,080 --> 0:09:35,920
 So what would be the shortest path between San Francisco and Los Angeles?

122
0:09:35,920 --> 0:09:40,200
 Clearly not New York at least.

123
0:09:40,200 --> 0:09:49,640
 That can sometimes happen due to some characteristics with our network routing.

124
0:09:49,640 --> 0:09:57,720
 You look at the shortest path, for example, in many, many cases, and also other things.

125
0:09:57,720 --> 0:10:03,600
 But it could be that your transit just didn't have a direct connection between San Francisco

126
0:10:03,600 --> 0:10:05,440
 and Los Angeles.

127
0:10:05,440 --> 0:10:08,120
 So you would need to go over New York.

128
0:10:08,120 --> 0:10:15,320
 So we have the instant exchange to avoid these kind of things.

129
0:10:15,320 --> 0:10:22,280
 It also gives lower latency because, again, we keep local traffic local.

130
0:10:22,280 --> 0:10:27,000
 It's easier to interconnect with other networks.

131
0:10:27,000 --> 0:10:33,360
 So what if we are two small providers and we don't necessarily have the need to connect

132
0:10:33,360 --> 0:10:35,360
 to each other?

133
0:10:36,240 --> 0:10:40,600
 Why should we pay transit when we are located in the same facility?

134
0:10:40,600 --> 0:10:51,640
 We can't justify paying the fees to have this cross-connect active and similar things.

135
0:10:51,640 --> 0:11:00,320
 So when you have the internet exchange, it makes things a bit easier when you're local.

136
0:11:00,360 --> 0:11:06,280
 So here is a very simplified quality of an internet exchange point.

137
0:11:06,280 --> 0:11:11,960
 Well, there are four providers of some kind.

138
0:11:11,960 --> 0:11:19,560
 They all connect with one link into a meet me room, as we call it.

139
0:11:19,560 --> 0:11:31,880
 And with this, we now, instead of everybody connecting to each other, with I have one

140
0:11:31,880 --> 0:11:35,880
 cable to you, you have one cable to you, I have one cable to you, we just have one cable

141
0:11:35,880 --> 0:11:38,800
 in and then we get the traffic via that cable.

142
0:11:38,800 --> 0:11:41,680
 That could be like a larger cable, for example.

143
0:11:41,680 --> 0:11:54,920
 So what I showed here is, yes, we do have the meet me room, but in an internet exchange,

144
0:11:54,920 --> 0:12:05,920
 we also can go from what we call bilateral to multilateral peering.

145
0:12:05,960 --> 0:12:11,480
 And it is from many to many to one to many.

146
0:12:11,480 --> 0:12:18,360
 As the image also shows, we have the route server.

147
0:12:18,360 --> 0:12:25,480
 And again, I'm just explaining this because it was not that easy for me in the first five

148
0:12:25,480 --> 0:12:31,840
 hours to understand why the fuck do we need a route server.

149
0:12:31,840 --> 0:12:32,840
 It was not really clear.

150
0:12:32,840 --> 0:12:34,560
 But now it's more clear for me, at least.

151
0:12:34,560 --> 0:12:40,680
 So the control plane traffic is now aggregated to the route server.

152
0:12:40,680 --> 0:12:48,040
 Don't necessarily aggregate all the data plane traffic, but at least the control traffic.

153
0:12:48,040 --> 0:12:51,960
 It kind of looks like this.

154
0:12:51,960 --> 0:12:59,120
 So we need less maintenance, we need less points, like less configurations that you

155
0:12:59,120 --> 0:13:05,520
 can screw up with.

156
0:13:05,520 --> 0:13:12,080
 If I'm already connected to a route server and we have some new clients that comes to

157
0:13:12,080 --> 0:13:19,040
 our IXP and then joins the route server, we can immediately peer with each other without

158
0:13:19,040 --> 0:13:25,240
 necessarily agreeing and talk to each other directly.

159
0:13:25,240 --> 0:13:30,080
 We can have our peering policy set as yes, I would like to accept everybody who is on

160
0:13:30,080 --> 0:13:32,600
 the route server.

161
0:13:32,600 --> 0:13:40,040
 We can also have a little more sense on what is going on in our IXP like traffic stats.

162
0:13:40,040 --> 0:13:42,640
 So our route server looks like this.

163
0:13:42,640 --> 0:13:45,040
 It's a very small machine.

164
0:13:45,040 --> 0:13:50,120
 It uses six foot of power.

165
0:13:50,120 --> 0:13:51,960
 We chose this because it was free.

166
0:13:51,960 --> 0:13:52,960
 And we had it.

167
0:13:53,280 --> 0:13:57,440
 I had it in my storage.

168
0:13:57,440 --> 0:14:01,240
 It fits really well for our use case.

169
0:14:01,240 --> 0:14:07,840
 The LaboSat Internet Exchange is only for very small devices, embedded devices like

170
0:14:07,840 --> 0:14:12,080
 APU 2 or Raspberry Pi.

171
0:14:12,080 --> 0:14:21,720
 So yeah, it didn't really make sense to have a large machine that could do fancy stuff

172
0:14:22,720 --> 0:14:26,320
 and have many more routes and things like that.

173
0:14:26,320 --> 0:14:37,040
 So the software is, well, Debian, we use a route server as a config parser to create

174
0:14:37,040 --> 0:14:38,040
 our BERT config.

175
0:14:38,040 --> 0:14:40,720
 And we use BERT as a BDP speaker.

176
0:14:40,720 --> 0:14:49,000
 So a route server does a lot of automation of, like, we have a list of clients and we

177
0:14:49,000 --> 0:14:58,000
 have some AS sets and we have some prefixes and similar things.

178
0:14:58,000 --> 0:15:06,240
 And then a route server creates all the 300,000 line config files.

179
0:15:06,240 --> 0:15:09,200
 So we don't need to maintain that.

180
0:15:09,200 --> 0:15:11,640
 Yes, server hosting.

181
0:15:11,640 --> 0:15:14,120
 It's located in LaboColo.

182
0:15:15,080 --> 0:15:19,240
 Again, there's links all over the place.

183
0:15:19,240 --> 0:15:28,840
 And yeah, Oliver and Espeon will go more into details on the LaboColo on a talk on Sunday.

184
0:15:28,840 --> 0:15:36,280
 But the very short version is it's intended for things like Raspberry Pi and APU 2.

185
0:15:36,280 --> 0:15:43,920
 But at Bornhack, you can connect to a LaboSphere village or you can connect via VLAN, which

186
0:15:43,960 --> 0:15:45,160
 I haven't received yet.

187
0:15:45,160 --> 0:15:49,360
 So yeah, but you can connect.

188
0:15:49,360 --> 0:15:59,680
 So we have made it so since our uplink is very nice that we have transported the VLAN

189
0:15:59,680 --> 0:16:09,880
 via Laptop and then over FibreVue, which is then Bornhack's uplink.

190
0:16:09,880 --> 0:16:16,080
 That means we can have the whole VLAN transported, the whole peering line transported down to

191
0:16:16,080 --> 0:16:17,080
 the camp.

192
0:16:17,080 --> 0:16:24,320
 That's a bit weird, but since we could, we did it.

193
0:16:24,320 --> 0:16:28,200
 So our switch looks like, our switch and our rack looks like this.

194
0:16:28,200 --> 0:16:30,200
 It's a horrible mess.

195
0:16:30,200 --> 0:16:38,480
 But again, the switch was a pre-used thing, it's a Cisco switch.

196
0:16:38,480 --> 0:16:39,920
 We are already using it.

197
0:16:39,920 --> 0:16:48,840
 It can do MagPort filtering and that's fine, it's nice for writing loops.

198
0:16:48,840 --> 0:16:55,920
 So yeah, it's a switch, that's not really much to show other than it can do that.

199
0:16:55,920 --> 0:17:01,120
 We actually tested out a switch which we found out could not use MagPort filtering.

200
0:17:01,120 --> 0:17:06,720
 So yeah, that's why we keep this.

201
0:17:06,720 --> 0:17:11,720
 We have a peering policy set up.

202
0:17:11,720 --> 0:17:21,680
 So when you join an internet exchange or start peering with other networks, you accept that

203
0:17:21,680 --> 0:17:22,680
 peering policy.

204
0:17:22,680 --> 0:17:32,600
 So it could be like I only accept traffic that is distant to you and I only send traffic

205
0:17:32,600 --> 0:17:36,160
 distant to you and you send traffic distant to me.

206
0:17:36,200 --> 0:17:40,840
 In an internet exchange, we have a few more things, not much.

207
0:17:40,840 --> 0:17:50,720
 Well we say we can say we will accept IPv4, ARP and IPv6 addresses, Ethernet frames, sorry.

208
0:17:50,720 --> 0:17:57,260
 We do not like proxy ARP, we do not like OSPF and other kinds of things.

209
0:17:57,260 --> 0:18:02,680
 We will do MagPort filtering again to avoid a lot of loops.

210
0:18:02,680 --> 0:18:09,320
 The same with proxy ARP, it creates funny things on the network.

211
0:18:09,320 --> 0:18:24,000
 So yes, we will not, well, routes learned through the peering network are not allowed

212
0:18:24,000 --> 0:18:27,680
 to be announced by BGP.

213
0:18:27,680 --> 0:18:36,760
 And we also would not like to be connected via a tunnel of some kind where the MTU is

214
0:18:36,760 --> 0:18:38,840
 lower than 1500.

215
0:18:38,840 --> 0:18:46,000
 So this means you have to be directly connected to us and not a remote IX which defeats a

216
0:18:46,000 --> 0:18:50,280
 lot of the purposes of internet exchange.

217
0:18:50,280 --> 0:18:57,320
 Though I have nothing against remote internet exchanges, but for all purposes it didn't

218
0:18:57,320 --> 0:19:01,920
 benefit.

219
0:19:01,920 --> 0:19:14,960
 So well, you have to get some IP, also internet resources, I call it here, but yes, IP applications.

220
0:19:14,960 --> 0:19:22,600
 So an AS number and an IP address is like, there is a large pool, I usually call it a

221
0:19:23,600 --> 0:19:27,000
 So a large cake, IANA owns the cake.

222
0:19:27,000 --> 0:19:34,200
 And then RIPE, which is the organization handing out IP addresses in Europe and Russia

223
0:19:34,200 --> 0:19:42,840
 and the Middle East, they get a bit smaller piece of the cake which they can then hand

224
0:19:42,840 --> 0:19:43,840
 out.

225
0:19:43,840 --> 0:19:51,880
 So you have the local internet registry that then they can then have a little smaller piece

226
0:19:51,880 --> 0:19:55,880
 of the cake which they can then hand out to you.

227
0:19:55,880 --> 0:20:02,280
 So RIPE do not want to talk to you, they have decided that they do not want to talk

228
0:20:02,280 --> 0:20:10,120
 to you, sorry, unless you are a local internet registry and that means you are a RIPE member.

229
0:20:10,120 --> 0:20:15,280
 I am a private person, so if I want an AS number, I do not necessarily want to pay the

230
0:20:15,280 --> 0:20:21,640
 1600 euro fee per year to be able to talk to RIPE.

231
0:20:21,640 --> 0:20:29,480
 So you need a sponsoring LIA to be able to get addresses.

232
0:20:29,480 --> 0:20:36,360
 You can find some nice people, you can also pay a bit for it, and there are multiple ways

233
0:20:36,360 --> 0:20:38,100
 to do it.

234
0:20:38,100 --> 0:20:46,080
 So we have found a LIA that we really like, it is a project called free transit project,

235
0:20:46,080 --> 0:20:49,440
 and there are some nice people.

236
0:20:49,440 --> 0:20:55,880
 So what is the difference between IP addresses when you have an IXP and your network operator

237
0:20:55,880 --> 0:21:02,320
 is that you would usually like your IP addresses to be globally routable, that means it is

238
0:21:02,320 --> 0:21:10,000
 your IP addresses and the route to them is in everybody's routing table.

239
0:21:10,000 --> 0:21:21,400
 So that is reasonable, but when you have an IXP you do not necessarily want to be globally

240
0:21:21,400 --> 0:21:22,400
 routable.

241
0:21:22,400 --> 0:21:29,480
 There are no reasons for the routers in your network to have a global route, it should

242
0:21:29,480 --> 0:21:36,040
 only be the routers on the peering land which should be able to connect to you.

243
0:21:36,240 --> 0:21:39,280
 So, yeah.

244
0:21:39,280 --> 0:21:53,000
 You have the, well, yeah, when you, well, so how do you, how do I know that you have

245
0:21:53,000 --> 0:21:56,160
 some resources allocated?

246
0:21:56,160 --> 0:22:04,000
 It is available in the regional internet registries databases, again, like RIPE, that we use in

247
0:22:04,000 --> 0:22:12,400
 our case, and so what you need to create an IX or just as a person, you need an organisation

248
0:22:12,400 --> 0:22:22,240
 object, you need a maintainer object, you need a person object, and also as a network

249
0:22:22,240 --> 0:22:30,840
 operator you need an AS set, this is for other networks to include in their routing policies.

250
0:22:30,880 --> 0:22:39,960
 So others can know that they are allowed to announce your prefixes, for example.

251
0:22:39,960 --> 0:22:47,640
 And I have again included a course, a small, very nice course in the bottom here.

252
0:22:47,640 --> 0:22:53,680
 So I also found out there is some miscellaneous info, I could never have guessed, when talking

253
0:22:53,680 --> 0:23:01,280
 to our local internet registry which then forwarded or it all directly to RIPE, well,

254
0:23:01,280 --> 0:23:10,560
 the obvious one is that, well, you actually need a name, yeah, I guess, so do you also

255
0:23:10,560 --> 0:23:17,160
 like want a route server, you have to think of that, and you probably do, so then it means

256
0:23:17,240 --> 0:23:24,440
 you need an AS number, and also you should probably get a 16-bit AS number, because you

257
0:23:24,440 --> 0:23:30,040
 never know if some customers bring really old equipment that cannot handle 32-bit AS

258
0:23:30,040 --> 0:23:31,040
 numbers.

259
0:23:31,040 --> 0:23:38,160
 A little bonus is that also that a 32-bit AS number fits on a Danish number plate, so

260
0:23:39,160 --> 0:23:47,560
 so you can get some, you can now find another plate that is valid in Denmark.

261
0:23:47,560 --> 0:23:58,640
 So we also need some prefixes, and this is one of the reasons why I said this, but not

262
0:23:58,640 --> 0:24:08,080
 global routable and globally routable, because we do have a shortage of IPv4 IP addresses,

263
0:24:08,080 --> 0:24:14,400
 so RIPE is not really keen to hand them out unless you really, really need, they have

264
0:24:14,400 --> 0:24:21,280
 set aside some addresses, and that's why you say, yes, I swear that I would not use these

265
0:24:21,280 --> 0:24:30,280
 two as normal services, and then you would get them, hooray.

266
0:24:30,280 --> 0:24:36,280
 You can also get a slash 48 IPv6 or larger if you really need, but you probably need,

267
0:24:36,280 --> 0:24:47,400
 you do not need a larger, like we use six addresses out of a lot, so yeah.

268
0:24:47,400 --> 0:24:55,080
 So yeah, again, things I had not thought of was get a hold of a seed or contract-confirming

269
0:24:55,080 --> 0:24:57,840
 connectivity to IXP ColoSight.

270
0:24:57,840 --> 0:25:05,800
 I had to find our bill to our Oblink, I guess it makes sense that our facilities somehow

271
0:25:05,800 --> 0:25:08,200
 should have an Oblink.

272
0:25:08,200 --> 0:25:14,600
 You also need to say, yes, I do have three customers that are willing to appear at our

273
0:25:14,600 --> 0:25:27,320
 IXP, so I'm not just creating an IXP for one, for me, and then I have no customers.

274
0:25:27,320 --> 0:25:35,120
 This also matters if you want to go and have the, be present on peeringDB as an IXP, again,

275
0:25:35,120 --> 0:25:43,880
 the magic number is at least three, and also with the IXP database.

276
0:25:43,880 --> 0:25:52,560
 These are some databases that people, network operators use to find out what IXP should

277
0:25:52,560 --> 0:25:56,000
 we go to, and what facilities should we go to, and who is there.

278
0:25:56,000 --> 0:26:01,600
 So it's a very nice way of network operators talking to each other.

279
0:26:01,600 --> 0:26:09,440
 It's kind of like a social media, but we don't post pictures, we just post where we are.

280
0:26:09,440 --> 0:26:17,520
 So yeah, again, facilities, like what is my address, and then you also need at least one

281
0:26:17,520 --> 0:26:21,280
 contact person and a phone number.

282
0:26:21,280 --> 0:26:27,520
 Just things I didn't know, and then it took five days extra to get all these sorted, so

283
0:26:27,600 --> 0:26:34,480
 you can send it at the same time, it would save a few days of talking back and forth.

284
0:26:34,480 --> 0:26:40,880
 So yes, the local internet registry, well, we used free transit projects, I have used

285
0:26:40,880 --> 0:26:49,920
 it for my own AS number, there are some nice people, also some hackers, so I like this,

286
0:26:49,920 --> 0:26:55,720
 but also I have a bias because I know some of them personally.

287
0:26:55,720 --> 0:27:03,240
 And if you want to find some local internet registry services, you can search on an Indian

288
0:27:03,240 --> 0:27:10,280
 right there service, and someone will gladly take your money to get an AS number and some

289
0:27:10,280 --> 0:27:13,840
 prefixes.

290
0:27:13,840 --> 0:27:19,400
 It is really expensive as just an organization to get IPv4 addresses, but I won't dwell too

291
0:27:19,400 --> 0:27:25,280
 much into that, it's just because we have a shortage and there's a market for that shortage.

292
0:27:25,280 --> 0:27:42,960
 So similar projects are, well, sorry, my tech phone is calling, okay, there we go.

293
0:27:42,960 --> 0:28:07,520
 So there are many internet exchanges in the world that are community run by network operators,

294
0:28:07,520 --> 0:28:14,840
 and it kind of makes sense, like some people got to get an ORB and said, hey, why don't

295
0:28:14,840 --> 0:28:15,840
 we do this?

296
0:28:15,840 --> 0:28:17,040
 And then they did this.

297
0:28:17,040 --> 0:28:26,800
 So yeah, like that's also commercially run, like a lot of them also, but I find it kind

298
0:28:26,800 --> 0:28:32,160
 of inspiring that a lot of them are just, hey, let's do this, and then we did this,

299
0:28:32,160 --> 0:28:40,760
 and people donated equipment and money and hosting and stuff, and it kind of just worked.

300
0:28:40,760 --> 0:28:43,200
 Real nice.

301
0:28:43,200 --> 0:28:55,520
 So yeah, there's also some hosting, some projects similar to ours, our HackerSpace, we have

302
0:28:56,360 --> 0:29:02,000
 in Amsterdam, we have CaseSpace in Tallinn, we have Communitech in Zurich, and they offer

303
0:29:02,000 --> 0:29:09,440
 some hosting of some kind, also to small machines and some larger machines for private persons

304
0:29:09,440 --> 0:29:21,280
 or small businesses, and there's also BGP.wtf, they do BGP stuff, similar to us, but they

305
0:29:21,280 --> 0:29:25,360
 are just in Warsaw instead.

306
0:29:25,360 --> 0:29:31,800
 And we have in Berlin also, which I learned recently also existed.

307
0:29:31,800 --> 0:29:38,000
 So if you're interested in finding some of these, I would say thanks to my collaborators,

308
0:29:38,000 --> 0:29:45,320
 so I did this as a school project also, so hooray, I got easy test points for this thing.

309
0:29:45,320 --> 0:29:52,640
 Olivia and Daniel helped me build this, and we also have Yorui, which is from the free

310
0:29:52,640 --> 0:30:00,040
 transfer project, and really nice, and then Ashburn, for having way too much knowledge

311
0:30:00,040 --> 0:30:06,120
 about networking, and it's a bit dangerous asking a question, because then you get a

312
0:30:06,120 --> 0:30:08,920
 very long answer.

313
0:30:08,920 --> 0:30:18,960
 So here are some good resources, like PNGDB, the interconnection database, yes, NUC meetups,

314
0:30:18,960 --> 0:30:24,960
 like we have in Denmark, most countries have them, there's a ripe academy, I learned a

315
0:30:24,960 --> 0:30:32,040
 lot on IPv6 with the course, that was really nice, and you don't have to take the certificate,

316
0:30:32,040 --> 0:30:37,200
 you can take the course, you can also pay to take the certificate if you want, but you

317
0:30:37,200 --> 0:30:40,400
 can learn a lot for free.

318
0:30:40,400 --> 0:30:48,600
 And yes, the network start meetups, they also helped me in some of the introductions, and

319
0:30:48,600 --> 0:30:54,880
 slides they have, that was really nice.

320
0:30:54,880 --> 0:31:04,000
 That's also, I didn't go into PNGDB filtering, it's a very important thing of network security,

321
0:31:04,000 --> 0:31:11,560
 but there's a small guide that InnoNUC have made collaboratively, and then InnoNUC also

322
0:31:12,360 --> 0:31:19,160
 have a thing they call InnoNUC ring, it's a nice way to find out how reachable is my

323
0:31:19,160 --> 0:31:22,880
 prefix.

324
0:31:22,880 --> 0:31:30,640
 And you can find us in a bornhack, in the Labitat, or Labifair village, there's a Dagnarva,

325
0:31:30,640 --> 0:31:37,440
 and in all other days you can find us on Labitat, we have a website for the IX, you can also

326
0:31:37,440 --> 0:31:44,920
 find us on PNGDB, so if you already got an AS number, you can join us, we'd really like

327
0:31:44,920 --> 0:31:51,560
 to have you, again, VLAN is not decided, we can also, if you bring a machine, we can probably

328
0:31:51,560 --> 0:31:55,800
 host it.

329
0:31:55,800 --> 0:32:01,440
 And if anyone wants to kind of sponsor this project, because it's been paid out of my

330
0:32:01,440 --> 0:32:07,640
 money until now, it wasn't really that expensive, but still, I'm a student, so, money.

331
0:32:07,640 --> 0:32:15,280
 All hardware is just things we found, and we're very, very nice with some updated hardware,

332
0:32:15,280 --> 0:32:21,240
 and maybe a second uplink, because you never know, some machine may just dig up the road

333
0:32:21,240 --> 0:32:27,440
 and kill the whole uplink, or something, something, and we like stickers.

334
0:32:27,440 --> 0:32:30,200

335
0:32:30,200 --> 0:32:37,840

336
0:32:37,840 --> 0:32:42,760
 but we would also like to have some, well, more peers, of course, but Looking Glass,

0:32:42,760 --> 0:32:52,680
