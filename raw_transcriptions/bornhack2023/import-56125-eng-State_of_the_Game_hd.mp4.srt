0:00:00,000 --> 0:00:11,880
 The next speakers we have is the game team that will give us the state of the game.

2
0:00:11,880 --> 0:00:14,880
 Let's give them a hand.

3
0:00:14,880 --> 0:00:19,120
 Thank you.

4
0:00:19,120 --> 0:00:22,520
 We were supposed to be three people presenting today.

5
0:00:22,520 --> 0:00:27,440
 One is currently treating a wound, so I will be the first one.

6
0:00:27,440 --> 0:00:34,720
 And then we will have Asbjorn announcing the winner of the game game in the last half.

7
0:00:34,720 --> 0:00:40,640
 So yes, the token game has now ended.

8
0:00:40,640 --> 0:00:47,360
 You can still attempt to find some tokens if you want, but you can't win anymore.

9
0:00:47,360 --> 0:00:54,240
 So we had a lot of different activities.

10
0:00:54,240 --> 0:00:57,420
 So the two official ones we have.

11
0:00:57,420 --> 0:01:06,180
 They are the Hacker Jeopardy and the Token Hunter.

12
0:01:06,180 --> 0:01:13,960
 But we also have a lot of game related things created by participants.

13
0:01:13,960 --> 0:01:15,540
 So we have some board games.

14
0:01:15,540 --> 0:01:19,540
 We have a game jam, which is announced in a bit.

15
0:01:19,540 --> 0:01:24,360
 A Pendleton, garden games, a Mario Kart tournament.

16
0:01:24,360 --> 0:01:26,700
 It sounds like they really had fun in that Mario Kart tournament.

17
0:01:26,700 --> 0:01:29,940
 I could hear it all the time.

18
0:01:29,940 --> 0:01:33,460
 We have music quiz, treasure hunt, and a 080 tournament.

19
0:01:33,460 --> 0:01:37,940
 So it's very nice to see people enjoying themselves.

20
0:01:37,940 --> 0:01:41,440
 And we also have the Pixel Flood, of course.

21
0:01:41,440 --> 0:01:47,200
 So the Hacker Jeopardy.

22
0:01:47,200 --> 0:01:52,660
 We had a lot of positive constructive feedback.

23
0:01:52,660 --> 0:01:56,360
 So we had this year done a bit of prep work.

24
0:01:56,360 --> 0:02:02,640
 I'm not personally the one who does the Hacker Jeopardy, but the team who did it did some

25
0:02:02,640 --> 0:02:05,360
 really nice work.

26
0:02:05,360 --> 0:02:11,680
 And it seemed to have paid off, the preparation.

27
0:02:11,680 --> 0:02:14,440
 They were really going a few months in a while.

28
0:02:14,440 --> 0:02:19,040
 So it was really nice to see all the emails we got.

29
0:02:19,040 --> 0:02:23,600
 Yes, and we got nine categories during the camp.

30
0:02:23,600 --> 0:02:24,600
 So that's it.

31
0:02:24,600 --> 0:02:25,600
 Thank you.

32
0:02:25,600 --> 0:02:26,840
 Any other questions?

33
0:02:26,840 --> 0:02:27,840
 So any минутes.

34
0:02:27,840 --> 0:02:28,840
 No, thank you.

35
0:02:28,840 --> 0:02:29,840
 We have some questions about...

36
0:02:29,840 --> 0:02:38,240
 One roundup for it is, we need more hacker, network, and cyber security-related topics.

37
0:02:38,240 --> 0:02:45,760
 We could see that some participants could need a bit of more network knowledge, but

38
0:02:45,760 --> 0:02:49,940
 it will also be nice to have some cyber security things.

39
0:02:49,940 --> 0:02:54,600
 We have previously been focused a lot on software-related stuff.

40
0:02:54,600 --> 0:02:55,600
 I hope that's a good point.

41
0:02:55,600 --> 0:03:00,720
 of, but it is a growing field and we have a lot of participants working in these fields

42
0:03:00,720 --> 0:03:06,900
 and interest in them. So if you have some ideas you can write it to the email listed

43
0:03:06,900 --> 0:03:14,960
 here. We would very much like so. You can just write it in this moment or wait a few

44
0:03:14,960 --> 0:03:26,800
 months, but we would very much like the categories because they are really hard to make up.

45
0:03:26,800 --> 0:03:34,400
 Well then we have the token game. So in 23 we had 60 participants. This is really nice.

46
0:03:34,400 --> 0:03:42,960
 It is actually a few more than in 2021 and 2022.

47
0:03:42,960 --> 0:03:44,940
 We had 27 participants.

48
0:03:44,940 --> 0:03:55,220
 The unique tokens, it is 10 more than the last time. We did a little more preparation.

49
0:03:55,220 --> 0:04:03,360
 So I think it is an okay, nice amount. I would personally like to prepare some more tokens

50
0:04:03,360 --> 0:04:10,720
 ahead of BornHack, but it is really hard to come up with tokens also. So if participants

51
0:04:10,720 --> 0:04:14,840
 want to make some, you are most definitely welcome and write us an email.

52
0:04:14,840 --> 0:04:14,920
 Thank you.

53
0:04:14,940 --> 0:04:25,480
 If you want. So the average tokens found per participant were four. Well, it is less

54
0:04:25,480 --> 0:04:34,120
 than 2021. You were really playing that year. But it is really nice that people who started

55
0:04:34,120 --> 0:04:39,420
 playing kept playing a bit more than last year. That is really nice to see. We have

56
0:04:39,420 --> 0:04:42,460
 eight participants who found more than 10 tokens.

57
0:04:42,460 --> 0:04:44,840
 That is the...

58
0:04:44,840 --> 0:04:51,220
 We do not really categorize them, but I would say that is like the players who keep playing

59
0:04:51,220 --> 0:04:55,480
 and attempting to find as many as they can.

60
0:04:55,480 --> 0:05:04,340
 And then we have two participants who found all 27 tokens. So you can battle it out with

61
0:05:04,340 --> 0:05:11,380
 whoever gets the prize. But you have to figure that out.

62
0:05:11,380 --> 0:05:14,680
 So what lessons did we learn this time?

63
0:05:14,680 --> 0:05:27,660
 We did not have enough tokens that did not need a computer. So a lot of the tokens require

64
0:05:27,660 --> 0:05:33,820
 to have some computing knowledge and also a computer in your hand. It would be nice

65
0:05:33,820 --> 0:05:42,580
 to have some more tokens that are based on puzzles and color recognition and similar

66
0:05:42,580 --> 0:05:43,580
 things.

67
0:05:43,580 --> 0:05:44,580
 Okay.

68
0:05:44,580 --> 0:05:53,660
 It has been heavily dependent on the token as a string, as a text string, so it's just

69
0:05:53,660 --> 0:05:59,260
 naturally that's the way we went, that somehow you could get a token out of a piece of string

70
0:05:59,260 --> 0:06:02,040
 somewhere.

71
0:06:02,040 --> 0:06:08,820
 But it would be very nice to have some things where you could use pattern recognition also.

72
0:06:08,820 --> 0:06:20,940
 Yes, I have already said it, but we would benefit if we prepare more.

73
0:06:20,940 --> 0:06:25,520
 We are very low maintenance when we're in off events.

74
0:06:25,520 --> 0:06:31,600
 Most of the content happens actually at the event and not even during build up.

75
0:06:31,600 --> 0:06:37,880
 It's just when the event starts, this is when token hunt creation starts.

76
0:06:37,880 --> 0:06:38,800
 Yeah.

77
0:06:38,800 --> 0:06:42,640
 We did some small things and it really helped out.

78
0:06:42,640 --> 0:06:50,300
 We had the space invader, for example, which already included token before it was set up.

79
0:06:50,300 --> 0:07:00,580
 So yeah, we have received a lot of nice input and yeah, we would like to also make tokens

80
0:07:00,580 --> 0:07:03,600
 more accessible for players.

81
0:07:03,600 --> 0:07:05,800
 So this is a thing that we need to work on.

82
0:07:05,800 --> 0:07:08,340
 It's again the thing with the computers.

83
0:07:08,340 --> 0:07:08,780
 Not everybody...

84
0:07:08,800 --> 0:07:21,180
 Not everybody is that good with computers necessarily or may not be studying a computer

85
0:07:21,180 --> 0:07:26,220
 science degree at a university and doing math all the time.

86
0:07:26,220 --> 0:07:36,620
 So again, it's like we keep enjoying this, but magic just happens when other teams and

87
0:07:36,620 --> 0:07:38,340
 other participants just say, hey, I would like to make a token.

88
0:07:38,340 --> 0:07:39,300
 I would like to make this token.

89
0:07:39,300 --> 0:07:41,180
 Can I make this token?

90
0:07:41,180 --> 0:07:46,500
 And then we say yes, most definitely.

91
0:07:46,500 --> 0:07:54,180
 So it's really nice when the batch team or this year, the phone operations center really

92
0:07:54,180 --> 0:07:57,200
 like just said, yeah, I would like to make this thing.

93
0:07:57,200 --> 0:07:57,900
 Can I make this thing?

94
0:07:57,900 --> 0:07:58,400
 Yeah.

95
0:07:58,400 --> 0:08:01,100
 And that came some really nice things out of it.

96
0:08:01,100 --> 0:08:04,260
 So I can show some more details on it.

97
0:08:04,260 --> 0:08:05,340
 We have the batch token.

98
0:08:05,340 --> 0:08:05,840
 Yeah.

99
0:08:05,840 --> 0:08:06,340
 Yeah.

100
0:08:06,340 --> 0:08:06,840
 Yeah.

101
0:08:06,840 --> 0:08:07,340
 Yeah.

102
0:08:07,340 --> 0:08:07,840
 Yeah.

103
0:08:07,840 --> 0:08:08,340
 Yeah.

104
0:08:08,340 --> 0:08:08,920
 Yeah.

105
0:08:08,920 --> 0:08:09,420
 Yeah.

106
0:08:09,420 --> 0:08:09,920
 Yeah.

107
0:08:09,920 --> 0:08:10,420
 Yeah.

108
0:08:10,420 --> 0:08:10,920
 Yeah.

109
0:08:11,420 --> 0:08:12,940
 So I'm not the one who created this.

110
0:08:12,940 --> 0:08:16,980
 I'm a bit unsure about the details on them, but let's get to it.

111
0:08:16,980 --> 0:08:20,840
 So on the batch, there is, well some letters you can read.

112
0:08:20,840 --> 0:08:24,880
 Well, they hit this whole grid, refers to a token.

113
0:08:24,880 --> 0:08:31,340
 So it is based encoded.

114
0:08:31,340 --> 0:08:35,540
 And you can if you decode it, you can get Frank Millard, 1806...

115
0:08:35,540 --> 0:08:36,040
 Maybe south!

116
0:08:36,040 --> 0:08:36,780
 Maybe south!

117
0:08:36,780 --> 0:08:37,440
 If he's from Africa.

118
0:08:37,440 --> 0:08:37,780
 Maybe south!

119
0:08:37,780 --> 0:08:38,080
 And it's just to know some more info.

120
0:08:38,080 --> 0:08:38,120
 Maybe south?

121
0:08:38,120 --> 0:08:38,180
 Sorry.

122
0:08:38,180 --> 0:08:38,340
 Something like this.

123
0:08:38,340 --> 0:08:41,860
 Yeah, well, and the year.

124
0:08:41,860 --> 0:08:51,060
 So you can, let's see how many we have here, yes, a lot of things.

125
0:08:51,060 --> 0:09:03,940
 So that's a lot of references to this one-time pad of the paper from Frank Miller and I guess

126
0:09:03,940 --> 0:09:11,100
 you had to go in and read it, or similar, to start finding the tokens.

127
0:09:11,100 --> 0:09:15,180
 But yes, that was most definitely tokens on the batch again this year.

128
0:09:15,180 --> 0:09:17,460
 Maybe we will have it again.

129
0:09:17,460 --> 0:09:28,500
 So the batch had NFC, right, yeah, I didn't make these slides, unfortunately, so I'm not

130
0:09:28,500 --> 0:09:33,700
 sure what all these numbers mean, but someone says hack the planet.

131
0:09:33,700 --> 0:09:33,820
 And you're right.

132
0:09:33,820 --> 0:09:33,920
 You're right.

133
0:09:33,920 --> 0:09:39,760
 Maybe you could convert it to the token at the end.

134
0:09:39,760 --> 0:09:43,940
 I'm sorry, I don't know what the end result gives.

135
0:09:43,940 --> 0:09:48,340
 Maybe a participant could explain.

136
0:09:48,340 --> 0:09:55,420
 Yeah, and then we have this one.

137
0:09:55,420 --> 0:10:03,800
 It's also a bit of evil that this batch gives you access to the data needed to gain SSL

138
0:10:03,800 --> 0:10:08,180
 access to a VM that contains some data that contains more tokens.

139
0:10:08,180 --> 0:10:18,200
 Yeah, again, I have no idea what this means.

140
0:10:18,200 --> 0:10:30,920
 It's unfortunately Dennis who knows what all these numbers mean, and yeah, you can find

141
0:10:30,920 --> 0:10:33,680
 him.

142
0:10:33,680 --> 0:10:38,600
 And you could find him in this talk if you want, and get some explanation, but sorry,

143
0:10:38,600 --> 0:10:41,100
 I cannot.

144
0:10:41,100 --> 0:10:44,780
 So we also had some dex phone numbers.

145
0:10:44,780 --> 0:10:53,420
 You can call the number that corresponds to token game, and it will read out some nice

146
0:10:53,420 --> 0:10:58,600
 letters to you in phonetic alphabet.

147
0:10:58,600 --> 0:11:02,560
 You probably have to record it or call it at least three times or four times to get

148
0:11:02,560 --> 0:11:03,560
 the whole thing.

149
0:11:03,560 --> 0:11:13,960
 a token there. You can also call the number token and you will get a conversation from

150
0:11:13,960 --> 0:11:22,060
 the movie Hackers where I crash overwrite the main character, request a number from

151
0:11:22,060 --> 0:11:33,540
 a person, and if you call that number, then you activate an ohm light where you can then

152
0:11:33,540 --> 0:11:41,500
 read the numbers. So, yeah, that's also Get Lisa's Numbers, and that's also one of the

153
0:11:41,500 --> 0:11:47,620
 numbers mentioned in the movie, one of the phone numbers, so you can get a little hint.

154
0:11:47,620 --> 0:11:51,900
 Thank you to the Phone Operations Centre, because that little piece of evil

155
0:11:51,900 --> 0:11:52,020
 was there.

156
0:11:52,060 --> 0:11:59,020
 That was actually very nice. I really loved calling in and testing different things.

157
0:11:59,020 --> 0:12:10,820
 Oh, yes, of course, that's conversion. I guess that says token, and that says Lisa,

158
0:12:10,820 --> 0:12:21,900
 and that says token hunt, or similar. Apparently, there was no audio. Sorry about that.

159
0:12:21,900 --> 0:12:33,860
 So, we also, well, I also made some artwork together with Bart, and this, well, it didn't

160
0:12:33,860 --> 0:12:40,420
 start as a token, but we made some artwork, and I thought, yeah, why not include a token?

161
0:12:40,420 --> 0:12:49,940
 This would be fun. So, that's a small thing that says Space Invader 1978, and if you mix

162
0:12:49,940 --> 0:12:51,740
 those letters around, you will get a token.

163
0:12:51,740 --> 0:13:00,340
 Very easy, but you just have to spot it. Also, credit to the nice person who took this

164
0:13:00,340 --> 0:13:10,460
 picture, because I'm not that good at taking images. We also have a token in the sticker

165
0:13:10,460 --> 0:13:18,940
 exchange. Maybe you can see the QR code. So, there were two boxes of stickers in the sticker

166
0:13:18,940 --> 0:13:21,580
 exchange at the info desk.

167
0:13:21,580 --> 0:13:34,580
 You scan both of them. The hint is ROT in the sticker exchange, so that was the hint.

168
0:13:34,580 --> 0:13:39,920
 And the QR code, one of the QR codes have some letters, and then it said plus four or

169
0:13:39,920 --> 0:13:48,660
 minus four, and the other one did the same. So, you could do a rotation, plus four, rotation

170
0:13:48,660 --> 0:13:50,880
 minus four, and put them together.

171
0:13:51,580 --> 0:14:00,640
 So, I accidentally made one of them a little too long, so it had 33 characters, but, yeah.

172
0:14:00,640 --> 0:14:07,780
 Small correction was that you just removed the last letter of the token.

173
0:14:07,780 --> 0:14:16,820
 So, this was the token hunt. Do we have any questions about some tokens? Maybe I can answer

174
0:14:16,820 --> 0:14:20,580
 some. Yes.

175
0:14:21,580 --> 0:14:26,540
 This was definitely not all tokens. It was just a few selects.

176
0:14:26,540 --> 0:14:33,820
 So, I saw that one of the tokens is the sequence of lights down the main path. Is that right?

177
0:14:33,820 --> 0:14:37,100
 Yeah, I think so, yes.

178
0:14:37,100 --> 0:14:43,600
 I couldn't figure out any combination of lights that would make up 30 and make sense. Also,

179
0:14:43,600 --> 0:14:47,380
 one of them is white.

180
0:14:47,380 --> 0:14:50,640
 Maybe the participant over here can answer the question.

181
0:14:51,580 --> 0:14:54,380
 So, I guess the question is how are you supposed to do that one?

182
0:14:54,380 --> 0:15:17,160
 So, the white one is actually blue. And you can see the paper and the film, if you look.

183
0:15:17,160 --> 0:15:18,580
 And there's two towards the cabin. Those count.

184
0:15:18,580 --> 0:15:19,580
 The first one is blue.

185
0:15:19,580 --> 0:15:20,580
 Yeah.

186
0:15:20,580 --> 0:15:21,580
 I think it's green. Yeah.

187
0:15:21,580 --> 0:15:26,580
 one here towards the bar doesn't count and the two towards the food area doesn't count

188
0:15:26,580 --> 0:15:31,580
 either. All right.

189
0:15:41,580 --> 0:15:45,580
 How can people sign up or help out with the game team? You didn't really specify.

190
0:15:45,580 --> 0:15:52,580
 Yeah. Well, you can sign up on the Bonehack website for the game team and then drop us an email and say,

191
0:15:52,580 --> 0:16:01,580
 hey, I would very much like to be part of the token hunt. Right now it's me and Dennis who are making the token hunt,

192
0:16:01,580 --> 0:16:10,580
 but having an extra person or two extra people being the, what is the English word for this,

193
0:16:10,580 --> 0:16:14,580
 but being the caretakers of the tokens.

194
0:16:15,580 --> 0:16:24,580
 Would be very nice. It would allow us to have more minds on it.

195
0:16:24,580 --> 0:16:29,580
 So, yes, go to the Bonehack website and sign up.

196
0:16:41,580 --> 0:16:45,580
 If I can ask, there was a hex in the game.

197
0:16:45,580 --> 0:16:49,580
 There was a hex in the slides between the presentations.

198
0:16:49,580 --> 0:16:53,580
 It looked like it was a valid token, but was it?

199
0:16:53,580 --> 0:16:54,580
 Which one, sorry?

200
0:16:54,580 --> 0:16:59,580
 There was a hex value in the slides between the presentations.

201
0:16:59,580 --> 0:17:00,580
 Yes.

202
0:17:00,580 --> 0:17:01,580
 So it was valid.

203
0:17:01,580 --> 0:17:06,580
 That was a hex encoded token in the info beamer, yes.

204
0:17:06,580 --> 0:17:13,580
 Yeah. I couldn't figure out how to, I mean, I decoded it, but I couldn't get to a valid token, but yeah.

205
0:17:13,580 --> 0:17:15,580
 So there's a very nice website called CyberChef.

206
0:17:15,580 --> 0:17:16,580
 Yes.

207
0:17:16,580 --> 0:17:17,580
 If you search on that.

208
0:17:17,580 --> 0:17:18,580
 I used it.

209
0:17:18,580 --> 0:17:19,580
 Okay.

210
0:17:19,580 --> 0:17:24,580
 If you type it in correctly, hopefully you should get the token.

211
0:17:24,580 --> 0:17:32,580
 There was not that much else in that token than finding it and typing it and then converting it over.

212
0:17:32,580 --> 0:17:34,580
 Yeah, I've done that.

213
0:17:34,580 --> 0:17:37,580
 But yeah, maybe you can show me later.

214
0:17:37,580 --> 0:17:39,580
 Yes.

215
0:17:39,580 --> 0:17:41,580
 But I also make mistakes sometimes.

216
0:17:41,580 --> 0:17:43,580
 So,

217
0:17:45,580 --> 0:17:50,580
 it could be I also made some mistake, but try again and then ask me if it didn't work.

218
0:17:50,580 --> 0:17:51,580
 So.

219
0:17:51,580 --> 0:17:53,580
 All right.

220
0:17:53,580 --> 0:17:57,580
 And then I will hop further to the next thing.

221
0:17:57,580 --> 0:18:00,580
 Well, we have the winner.

222
0:18:00,580 --> 0:18:03,580
 Oh, apparently it's, oh, sorry.

223
0:18:03,580 --> 0:18:07,580
 Beyond the end of the talk.

224
0:18:07,580 --> 0:18:08,580
 Sorry about that.

225
0:18:08,580 --> 0:18:13,580
 I had to change that in the last second since I didn't look at the, yeah, sorry.

226
0:18:13,580 --> 0:18:16,580
 We have the Pixel Flute.

227
0:18:16,580 --> 0:18:18,580
 Well, this is a graph.

228
0:18:18,580 --> 0:18:26,580
 It's also showed up in the NOC, sorry, State of the Network talk.

229
0:18:26,580 --> 0:18:31,580
 This is a monstrosity made by Aspion.

230
0:18:31,580 --> 0:18:37,580
 So, it has an 80 gigabits, which I can explain a bit more about it.

231
0:18:37,580 --> 0:18:41,580
 But we had some participants pulling their own fibers.

232
0:18:41,580 --> 0:18:42,580
 We had Aspion.

233
0:18:42,580 --> 0:18:46,580
 We had Aspion himself making a pixel accelerator.

234
0:18:46,580 --> 0:18:56,580
 Takes a 10 megabit nick, like an old Bonhack batch, and then do loop magic.

235
0:18:56,580 --> 0:19:02,580
 And apparently turns it up to 10 gigabits.

236
0:19:02,580 --> 0:19:08,580
 I don't know, like something with 15 kilometers of fiber.

237
0:19:08,580 --> 0:19:10,580
 Yeah.

238
0:19:10,580 --> 0:19:12,580
 Yeah.

239
0:19:12,580 --> 0:19:18,580
 It took a few days to get this up and running, but it seems like people were enjoying themselves.

240
0:19:18,580 --> 0:19:26,580
 So, I hope this can keep showing up and more people would like to participate.

241
0:19:26,580 --> 0:19:30,580
 We have a little graph here.

242
0:19:30,580 --> 0:19:37,580
 Well, you can see it started, okay, the graph at least started Sunday.

243
0:19:37,580 --> 0:19:40,580
 I can hop over to this and say, well,

244
0:19:40,580 --> 0:19:49,580
 the peak at the 95 percentile was at 31 gigabits per second.

245
0:19:49,580 --> 0:19:53,580
 The switch is limited to 80 gigabits.

246
0:19:53,580 --> 0:19:55,580
 So, we'll get to near that.

247
0:19:55,580 --> 0:19:58,580
 Well, I guess we will get a larger switch or something.

248
0:19:58,580 --> 0:20:00,580
 But we averaged it.

249
0:20:00,580 --> 0:20:01,580
 Averaged it.

250
0:20:01,580 --> 0:20:03,580
 I cannot say that word.

251
0:20:03,580 --> 0:20:06,580
 Our average was 21 gigabits per second.

252
0:20:06,580 --> 0:20:08,580
 And the peak is like a weird thing to count.

253
0:20:08,580 --> 0:20:13,580
 But at 43.

254
0:20:13,580 --> 0:20:15,580
 We had some new protocols.

255
0:20:15,580 --> 0:20:17,580
 I misspelled that, apparently.

256
0:20:17,580 --> 0:20:20,580
 New protocols implemented.

257
0:20:20,580 --> 0:20:22,580
 You can find it on the link.

258
0:20:22,580 --> 0:20:27,580
 It's the same link that hopefully all players saw.

259
0:20:27,580 --> 0:20:31,580
 Again, this year, we had multiple 10 gigabit clients.

260
0:20:31,580 --> 0:20:35,580
 Yes, the pixel accelerator thing was great.

261
0:20:35,580 --> 0:20:37,580
 Great.

262
0:20:37,580 --> 0:20:41,580
 We streamed some movies on it.

263
0:20:41,580 --> 0:20:45,580
 Well, not me, but Max streamed some movies on it.

264
0:20:45,580 --> 0:20:54,580
 Labifier Village pulls their own fiber and put in some QSFP plus optics.

265
0:20:54,580 --> 0:21:00,580
 They were, however, limited to 10 gigabits per machine.

266
0:21:00,580 --> 0:21:06,580
 So, it's not like bring the largest machine you can and the largest neck.

267
0:21:06,580 --> 0:21:13,580
 Because I could just find a 100 gigabit neck and put it in if the switch could take it.

268
0:21:13,580 --> 0:21:18,580
 So, all clients are limited to 10 gigabits.

269
0:21:18,580 --> 0:21:20,580
 And we were as well.

270
0:21:20,580 --> 0:21:29,580
 But we just could sit in our comfy tents instead of going all the way out and installing a machine.

271
0:21:29,580 --> 0:21:33,580
 Legacy IP addresses were again punished this year.

272
0:21:33,580 --> 0:21:35,580
 You had to use IPv6.

273
0:21:35,580 --> 0:21:42,580
 Or else you would get some transparency on your pixels.

274
0:21:42,580 --> 0:21:45,580
 You can see the little pony, perhaps.

275
0:21:45,580 --> 0:21:50,580
 That was because I didn't update my client and could not find the IPv6 version I made somewhere.

276
0:21:50,580 --> 0:21:53,580
 So, yes, it was transparent.

277
0:21:53,580 --> 0:22:02,580
 I just sent enough pixels that it's not immediately visible.

278
0:22:02,580 --> 0:22:13,580
 So, there was also a participant who attempted to create a distributed Pixel Flu client.

279
0:22:13,580 --> 0:22:17,580
 The goal was to play Doom on it.

280
0:22:17,580 --> 0:22:23,580
 Like with one controller and then multiple machines, like multiple small machines and stuff.

281
0:22:23,580 --> 0:22:30,580
 The distributed version or distribution thing worked but not playing Doom.

282
0:22:30,580 --> 0:22:33,580
 Maybe that will work next time.

283
0:22:33,580 --> 0:22:39,580
 So, yes, I guess we can go to the Gamjam.

284
0:22:39,580 --> 0:22:44,580
 And I will attempt to remember to announce the winners of the token hunt.

285
0:22:52,580 --> 0:22:54,580
 Tuki!

286
0:22:54,580 --> 0:22:57,580
 Jan Poonamute, Li Pali, Ilu Musi.

287
0:22:57,580 --> 0:22:58,580
 Oh, wait.

288
0:22:58,580 --> 0:22:59,580
 I have to do this.

289
0:22:59,580 --> 0:23:00,580
 I'm just talking English.

290
0:23:00,580 --> 0:23:01,580
 Right.

291
0:23:01,580 --> 0:23:02,580
 Then you understand.

292
0:23:02,580 --> 0:23:03,580
 Okay.

293
0:23:03,580 --> 0:23:04,580
 We did the first ever Born Hack Gamjam.

294
0:23:04,580 --> 0:23:05,580
 And it was a great success.

295
0:23:05,580 --> 0:23:11,580
 Thank you for everybody who played.

296
0:23:11,580 --> 0:23:14,580
 If you have your laptop out right now, you can go to pyjam.as.

297
0:23:14,580 --> 0:23:16,580
 And see all the submissions.

298
0:23:16,580 --> 0:23:22,580
 We had eight very beautiful games made by, I think, something like 15 nice hackers.

299
0:23:22,580 --> 0:23:28,580
 All of the games had to fit the theme Switch, which was announced last Friday at 1800.

300
0:23:28,580 --> 0:23:29,580
 And then we had three days.

301
0:23:29,580 --> 0:23:30,580
 To complete the game.

302
0:23:30,580 --> 0:23:31,580
 The deadline was yesterday at 1800.

303
0:23:31,580 --> 0:23:32,580
 So, since there's eight games, I just want to show you all of them.

304
0:23:32,580 --> 0:23:33,580
 Because I couldn't help myself.

305
0:23:33,580 --> 0:23:34,580
 This one, Kill Switch by Vell, is really cool.

306
0:23:34,580 --> 0:23:35,580
 It was made by a child.

307
0:23:35,580 --> 0:23:36,580
 I think the first time they ever made a game.

308
0:23:36,580 --> 0:23:37,580
 It's a Switch.

309
0:23:37,580 --> 0:23:38,580
 There's also, like, some Nintendo Switches.

310
0:23:38,580 --> 0:23:39,580
 And there's some networking Switches.

311
0:23:39,580 --> 0:23:40,580
 And there's a light Switch.

312
0:23:40,580 --> 0:23:41,580
 And you have to press one of three buttons and try and kill the prisoner instead of the

313
0:23:41,580 --> 0:23:42,580
 cops.

314
0:23:42,580 --> 0:23:43,580
 But, yeah.

315
0:23:43,580 --> 0:23:44,580
 So, yeah.

316
0:23:44,580 --> 0:23:45,580
 So, yeah.

317
0:23:45,580 --> 0:23:46,580
 So, yeah.

318
0:23:46,580 --> 0:23:47,580
 So, yeah.

319
0:23:47,580 --> 0:23:48,580
 So, yeah.

320
0:23:48,580 --> 0:23:49,580
 So, yeah.

321
0:23:49,580 --> 0:23:50,580
 So, yeah.

322
0:23:50,580 --> 0:23:51,580
 So, yeah.

323
0:23:51,580 --> 0:23:52,580
 So, yeah.

324
0:23:52,580 --> 0:23:53,580
 So, yeah.

325
0:23:53,580 --> 0:23:54,580
 So, yeah.

326
0:23:54,580 --> 0:23:55,580
 So, yeah.

327
0:23:55,580 --> 0:23:56,580
 So, yeah.

328
0:23:56,580 --> 0:23:57,580
 So, yeah.

329
0:23:57,580 --> 0:23:58,580
 So, yeah.

330
0:23:58,580 --> 0:23:59,580
 So, yeah.

331
0:23:59,580 --> 0:24:00,580
 So, yeah.

332
0:24:00,580 --> 0:24:01,580
 So, yeah.

333
0:24:01,580 --> 0:24:02,580
 So, yeah.

334
0:24:02,580 --> 0:24:03,580
 So, yeah.

335
0:24:03,580 --> 0:24:04,580
 So, yeah.

336
0:24:04,580 --> 0:24:05,580
 So, yeah.

337
0:24:05,580 --> 0:24:06,580
 So, yeah.

338
0:24:06,580 --> 0:24:07,580
 So, yeah.

339
0:24:07,580 --> 0:24:08,580
 So, yeah.

340
0:24:08,580 --> 0:24:09,580
 So, yeah.

341
0:24:09,580 --> 0:24:10,580
 So, yeah.

342
0:24:10,580 --> 0:24:11,580
 So, yeah.

343
0:24:11,580 --> 0:24:12,580
 But, it's very cool.

344
0:24:12,580 --> 0:24:13,580
 It plays on the web browser.

345
0:24:13,580 --> 0:24:14,580
 And it has a leaderboard.

346
0:24:14,580 --> 0:24:15,580
 Moral switch is gamifying the trolley problem.

347
0:24:15,580 --> 0:24:16,580
 When the game was given a moral dilemma.

348
0:24:16,580 --> 0:24:17,580
 And you have to choose who you want to kill.

349
0:24:17,580 --> 0:24:18,580
 The text was generated, I think, using a large language model.

350
0:24:18,580 --> 0:24:20,560
 And also, images that were being made on the fly.

351
0:24:20,560 --> 0:24:23,580
 So, it would make at run-time new scenarios.

352
0:24:23,580 --> 0:24:24,580
 That's quite cool.

353
0:24:24,580 --> 0:24:30,740
 Somebody made a game called Pass Parentheses 2, I think they uploaded it under the same

354
0:24:30,740 --> 0:24:36,700
 name twice, but this was Astro One, Mass, Nilsson, Philip.

355
0:24:36,700 --> 0:24:42,180
 This is a game which had several different backend implementations, so every time you

356
0:24:42,180 --> 0:24:47,160
 die you switch to a different backend which had its own complete different state and different

357
0:24:47,160 --> 0:24:49,160
 rules for the game.

358
0:24:49,160 --> 0:24:54,180
 I think there was backend written in like Haskell and Go and Rust, right?

359
0:24:54,180 --> 0:24:56,400
 So that's kind of crazy.

360
0:24:56,400 --> 0:24:59,140
 So there's several different games, there's one which is like a pixel art drawing game

361
0:24:59,140 --> 0:25:01,640
 and this is a snake game.

362
0:25:01,640 --> 0:25:06,300
 This one turns out to be a lot of fun because there's an HTML injection in the username

363
0:25:06,300 --> 0:25:07,300
 field.

364
0:25:07,300 --> 0:25:12,160
 So you can just change the game on the fly, yeah, this website was looking really crazy

365
0:25:12,160 --> 0:25:15,920
 last night because of the HTML injection, that was cool.

366
0:25:15,920 --> 0:25:18,680
 Dao also made a game called Save the Network.

367
0:25:18,680 --> 0:25:19,120
 Which is about...

368
0:25:19,160 --> 0:25:23,180
 It's about defending a network switch, you have all of these different ports, some of

369
0:25:23,180 --> 0:25:28,240
 them they turn red while they're being hacked, so you have to be quick and click it, so it's

370
0:25:28,240 --> 0:25:29,800
 kind of like a whack-a-mole game.

371
0:25:29,800 --> 0:25:35,080
 This is super difficult, but it has nice audio and stuff also.

372
0:25:35,080 --> 0:25:41,200
 Another cool game, Designuda, Nicholas, made a game called Shield Switch, in which it's

373
0:25:41,200 --> 0:25:46,960
 sort of like an Asteroids type game, where there's different types of asteroids, it's

374
0:25:46,960 --> 0:25:48,680
 difficult to see right now, but these are like the red ones.

375
0:25:48,680 --> 0:25:53,760
 And then you switch between being in the red state or the blue state, so you can pass

376
0:25:53,760 --> 0:25:57,540
 the phase through different kinds of asteroids, depending on what color it is.

377
0:25:57,540 --> 0:25:58,540
 That's quite cool.

378
0:25:58,540 --> 0:26:02,560
 Nicholas, who made this game, also composed an original soundtrack for this game, and

379
0:26:02,560 --> 0:26:06,180
 just because he had more time and wanted to, he also made an original soundtrack for this

380
0:26:06,180 --> 0:26:09,920
 game, so that's super cool.

381
0:26:09,920 --> 0:26:15,980
 This sliding snake is a terminal-based game, in which you control a snake and you try and

382
0:26:15,980 --> 0:26:17,680
 avoid these lines of trees.

383
0:26:17,680 --> 0:26:18,520
 And then you switch between being in the red state or the blue state, so you can pass the

384
0:26:18,520 --> 0:26:19,360
 phase through different kinds of asteroids.

385
0:26:19,360 --> 0:26:24,460
 I think this was originally made to run on a receipt printer.

386
0:26:24,460 --> 0:26:26,760
 That's great.

387
0:26:26,760 --> 0:26:27,960
 This was my game.

388
0:26:27,960 --> 0:26:32,440
 It's like a physics-based game, where you're the snake inside of your network switch, because

389
0:26:32,440 --> 0:26:35,160
 you know the snake inside the network switch, right?

390
0:26:35,160 --> 0:26:40,320
 You pick up packets and you try and drop them in the right place, and you try not to switch

391
0:26:40,320 --> 0:26:43,320
 the packets wrong.

392
0:26:43,320 --> 0:26:47,520
 Samuel made a game called Switch Off the Music, this is a mobile phone game, which is GPS-based.

393
0:26:48,520 --> 0:26:53,640
 So the plot is that it's late and all the hackers are making a lot of noise, and you

394
0:26:53,640 --> 0:26:58,460
 have to go and find the parties and then tell them to turn off the music.

395
0:26:58,460 --> 0:27:02,400
 This game will get your heart rate up, like you're sprinting around the field and trying

396
0:27:02,400 --> 0:27:06,120
 to turn off the music before you lose your patience.

397
0:27:06,120 --> 0:27:07,120
 That's a lot of fun.

398
0:27:07,120 --> 0:27:10,060
 All right, so those were the games.

399
0:27:10,060 --> 0:27:12,300
 We had a rating system, so it works like this.

400
0:27:12,300 --> 0:27:17,520
 Anybody who submitted a game could rate the other games.

401
0:27:17,520 --> 0:27:20,840
 We had a little bit less than 24 hours to play and rate all of them.

402
0:27:20,840 --> 0:27:21,840
 These are the categories.

403
0:27:21,840 --> 0:27:26,420
 There's an overall score that determines the winner of the game jam totally, and then these

404
0:27:26,420 --> 0:27:31,960
 other aspects of creativity and aesthetics, how well it fit the theme of Switch, and how

405
0:27:31,960 --> 0:27:33,980
 fun the gameplay was.

406
0:27:33,980 --> 0:27:38,280
 So let's do the winner's announcement for each of these categories.

407
0:27:38,280 --> 0:27:41,080
 The aesthetic winner is...

408
0:27:41,080 --> 0:27:42,080
 Mortal Switch!

409
0:27:47,520 --> 0:28:02,140
 The creativity winner is, and I'm sure you're not surprised about this, Switch Off the Music!

410
0:28:02,140 --> 0:28:04,580
 The gameplay winner is...

411
0:28:04,580 --> 0:28:11,580
 Shield Switch!

412
0:28:11,580 --> 0:28:14,420
 And the theme winner is...

413
0:28:14,420 --> 0:28:15,420
 Moral Switch!

414
0:28:15,420 --> 0:28:16,420
 Again!

415
0:28:16,420 --> 0:28:17,420
 Thank you.

416
0:28:17,520 --> 0:28:22,280
 All right, can I have a drum roll for the total winner?

417
0:28:22,280 --> 0:28:26,620
 The winner of the Born to Hack Game Jam 2023 is...

418
0:28:26,620 --> 0:28:29,140
 Shield Switch!

419
0:28:29,140 --> 0:28:35,660
 But really, so much thanks to everybody who played.

420
0:28:35,660 --> 0:28:39,600
 It's been a lot of fun making games with you, and we're definitely going to do this again

421
0:28:39,600 --> 0:28:41,600
 next year.

422
0:28:41,600 --> 0:28:45,760
 So there's a theme for the game jam, which was Switch this year.

423
0:28:45,760 --> 0:28:46,840
 I'd really like to hear suggestions.

424
0:28:46,840 --> 0:28:49,380
 I'd like to hear suggestions for a theme for next year.

425
0:28:49,380 --> 0:28:53,340
 The game jam Luludare does this thing of submitting a bunch of different themes, and then we vote

426
0:28:53,340 --> 0:28:54,340
 about it.

427
0:28:54,340 --> 0:28:55,340
 I think we should do that next year.

428
0:28:55,340 --> 0:28:59,080
 So send an email to the game team, or send a message to me, or just come find me if you

429
0:28:59,080 --> 0:29:01,080
 have a good idea for a theme.

430
0:29:01,080 --> 0:29:03,900
 Also I want to make it so that I don't know the theme in advance, because that would be

431
0:29:03,900 --> 0:29:04,900
 more fun for me.

432
0:29:04,900 --> 0:29:05,900
 Yeah, but that's it for game jam.

433
0:29:05,900 --> 0:29:06,900
 Thanks for playing.

434
0:29:06,900 --> 0:29:07,900
 And as you can see, he's a big fan of the game.

435
0:29:07,900 --> 0:29:08,900
 He's a big fan of the game.

436
0:29:08,900 --> 0:29:09,900
 He's a big fan of the game.

437
0:29:09,900 --> 0:29:10,900
 He's a big fan of the game.

438
0:29:10,900 --> 0:29:11,900
 He's a big fan of the game.

439
0:29:11,900 --> 0:29:12,900
 He's a big fan of the game.

440
0:29:12,900 --> 0:29:13,900
 He's a big fan of the game.

441
0:29:13,900 --> 0:29:20,860
 And as you can see, he's a bit more energetic than I am.

442
0:29:20,860 --> 0:29:27,340
 So yes, now the Tokenhund winner is, well, yeah, you have to play Rock, Paper, and Scissor,

443
0:29:27,340 --> 0:29:36,740
 but it's Emilie and Sebastian.

444
0:29:36,740 --> 0:29:41,340
 You can decide amongst yourself, or do you want to play Rock, Paper, and Scissor?

445
0:29:41,340 --> 0:29:43,340
 Last Token, first.

446
0:29:43,340 --> 0:29:43,840
 Okay.

447
0:29:43,900 --> 0:29:48,860
 I guess we can fight for a year about that one.

448
0:29:48,860 --> 0:29:54,500
 So, yes, thank you so much for visiting this talk.

449
0:29:54,500 --> 0:29:55,500
 See you next year.

450
0:29:55,500 --> 0:30:06,780
 Are there any questions?

451
0:30:06,780 --> 0:30:13,340
 Thank you for the great presentation.

452
0:30:13,340 --> 0:30:17,380
 Thank you for the great state of the game.

453
0:30:17,380 --> 0:30:19,980
 Let's give him a round of applause.
