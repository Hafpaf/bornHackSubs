0:00:00,000 --> 0:00:08,180
 Okay, we are about to begin the next presentation.

2
0:00:08,180 --> 0:00:13,500
 We have Benjamin who is here to talk about an introduction to digital consent, why a

3
0:00:13,500 --> 0:00:16,740
 new definition with new tools and specifications are needed.

4
0:00:16,740 --> 0:00:24,040
 Let's give a round of applause for Benjamin.

5
0:00:24,040 --> 0:00:25,400
 Thank you so much.

6
0:00:25,400 --> 0:00:30,040
 I have a quick sponsorship message before starting the talk, so I just want to start

7
0:00:30,040 --> 0:00:33,720
 with that so I don't forget it.

8
0:00:33,720 --> 0:00:41,040
 A Danish organization called Django Denmark is hosting Django Day, like an annual one-day

9
0:00:41,040 --> 0:00:43,940
 event for Django people.

10
0:00:43,940 --> 0:00:44,940
 It's in Copenhagen.

11
0:00:44,940 --> 0:00:52,760
 We found a really lovely venue on Nørrebro and talks are coming in and tickets are on

12
0:00:52,760 --> 0:00:54,300
 sale and so on.

13
0:00:54,300 --> 0:00:55,300
 So that's on the 6th of January.

14
0:00:55,300 --> 0:00:59,460
 And that's the website for that.

15
0:00:59,460 --> 0:01:01,260
 So I hope that maybe you're interested.

16
0:01:01,260 --> 0:01:06,300
 There is also a little Django perspective in this talk.

17
0:01:06,300 --> 0:01:19,340
 So I'm a software developer and I want to talk about consent with the background that

18
0:01:19,340 --> 0:01:23,620
 I have as a software developer.

19
0:01:23,620 --> 0:01:25,140
 And maybe I'm not.

20
0:01:25,140 --> 0:01:28,580
 Maybe I'm not so precise on the legal aspect.

21
0:01:28,580 --> 0:01:32,320
 So this is not like legal advice about how to do consent.

22
0:01:32,320 --> 0:01:40,660
 But I hope it aligns with your understanding of GDPR and those sorts of legal obligations

23
0:01:40,660 --> 0:01:45,520
 that we have when we build systems with data, basically.

24
0:01:45,520 --> 0:01:49,300
 So it's also the first time in a long time that I'm doing a talk.

25
0:01:49,300 --> 0:01:50,300
 And last time I was part of a conference.

26
0:01:50,300 --> 0:01:51,300
 I was part of a conference.

27
0:01:51,300 --> 0:01:52,300
 I was part of a conference.

28
0:01:52,300 --> 0:01:53,300
 I was part of a conference.

29
0:01:53,300 --> 0:01:54,300
 I was part of a conference.

30
0:01:54,300 --> 0:02:05,060
 And last time I was preparing a talk, I found out that I was very confused around what focus

31
0:02:05,060 --> 0:02:06,060
 to find.

32
0:02:06,060 --> 0:02:16,140
 So now I ask, like, why do I think this is a talk to present here for you and for your

33
0:02:16,140 --> 0:02:18,100
 sake, for my sake?

34
0:02:18,100 --> 0:02:22,220
 And let's just make those terms clear.

35
0:02:22,220 --> 0:02:23,740
 Let's make the purpose of the talk clear.

36
0:02:23,740 --> 0:02:35,300
 I really want, like, more people to care about the question of consent, digital consent.

37
0:02:35,300 --> 0:02:41,140
 But in order so that we can build something, and so that we can build something together.

38
0:02:41,140 --> 0:02:46,980
 So I'll try to, as a software developer, maintain the aspect that we talk a lot about consent,

39
0:02:46,980 --> 0:02:49,500
 but in the end, let's try to make it – turn it into a tool so that when we want to, you're

40
0:02:49,500 --> 0:02:50,500
 going to be able to implement it.

41
0:02:50,500 --> 0:02:51,500
 So if you're going to be able to do it, you're going to be able to do it.

42
0:02:51,500 --> 0:02:52,500
 So that's part of the talk.

43
0:02:52,500 --> 0:02:53,500
 Yeah.

44
0:02:53,500 --> 0:03:04,200
 have consent for something in an application, we're doing it the best possible way. So I

45
0:03:04,200 --> 0:03:21,180
 hope you agree to that. Some of it is below the phone suit. It's also Latin. So I'll try

46
0:03:21,180 --> 0:03:32,740
 to cover these four aspects here. First, those pesky cookie banners that we all know about.

47
0:03:32,740 --> 0:03:42,280
 They're everywhere. And then I'll talk a bit about consent, like what can we say, what

48
0:03:42,280 --> 0:03:51,180
 sort of properties can we attach to consent in order to have a definition of it. Then

49
0:03:51,180 --> 0:03:58,520
 from that definition, can we specify something that we can use to implement software? And

50
0:03:58,520 --> 0:04:07,560
 then finally I'll just share a little bit about what I've been trying to do. I hope

51
0:04:07,560 --> 0:04:17,520
 that people can hear because it's very loud for me up here with the rain. Okay. Cool.

52
0:04:17,520 --> 0:04:20,620
 So those pesky cookie banners.

53
0:04:21,180 --> 0:04:32,660
 I'll just show you a few examples to get the thought process started, what's happening

54
0:04:32,660 --> 0:04:35,520
 right now with consent.

55
0:04:35,520 --> 0:04:46,820
 It's basically that people want to continue to use and share data, it's still okay.

56
0:04:46,820 --> 0:04:53,660
 They want to continue to use and share data the same way, kind of business as usual, but

57
0:04:53,660 --> 0:05:01,580
 we'll just add even more layers of terms and conditions.

58
0:05:01,580 --> 0:05:09,060
 And I've been annoyed at it and posted stuff on social media when I saw a dialogue that

59
0:05:09,060 --> 0:05:16,420
 I didn't like, and I was trying to figure out some examples before the talk, and basically

60
0:05:16,420 --> 0:05:16,540
 I just said, you know what, I don't want to do this.

61
0:05:16,540 --> 0:05:16,580
 I don't want to do this.

62
0:05:16,580 --> 0:05:16,640
 I don't want to do this.

63
0:05:16,640 --> 0:05:16,680
 I don't want to do this.

64
0:05:16,680 --> 0:05:16,780
 I don't want to do this.

65
0:05:16,780 --> 0:05:16,800
 I don't want to do this.

66
0:05:16,800 --> 0:05:16,820
 I don't want to do this.

67
0:05:16,820 --> 0:05:22,100
 I just went to the first two kind of random pages that I found, so these are not, these

68
0:05:22,100 --> 0:05:24,020
 examples are not cherry-picked.

69
0:05:24,200 --> 0:05:36,820
 I just went on the normal internet and looked, and I went to wordpress.com, and they say

70
0:05:37,420 --> 0:05:45,340
 they're the world's most popular website building tool, so let's hope they get consent right

71
0:05:45,340 --> 0:05:48,740
 and I would say they don't.

72
0:05:48,740 --> 0:06:02,220
 You go to the front page, and there is no consent dialogue at all, but there is trackers.

73
0:06:05,020 --> 0:06:09,780
 So there is trackers on the website.

74
0:06:09,780 --> 0:06:09,900
 Okay.

75
0:06:09,900 --> 0:06:20,820
 For the stream, people, I can say there is a very heavy rain coming down right now, so

76
0:06:20,820 --> 0:06:23,540
 we have a lot of problems with the sound in here.

77
0:06:27,200 --> 0:06:31,040
 I'll let folks move a little bit.

78
0:06:33,900 --> 0:06:34,720
 Yeah, okay.

79
0:06:35,200 --> 0:06:39,720
 So people are just moving around in the room here so that we can sit a little bit closer.

80
0:06:39,720 --> 0:06:39,860
 Okay.

81
0:06:39,860 --> 0:06:39,880
 Okay.

82
0:06:39,900 --> 0:06:44,540
 And then we hope the rain will cool off.

83
0:07:04,120 --> 0:07:05,080
 That's a lot better.

84
0:07:06,300 --> 0:07:06,540
 Okay.

85
0:07:06,820 --> 0:07:08,600
 Yeah, it was the weather not the technique.

86
0:07:08,600 --> 0:07:09,500
 Yeah.

87
0:07:09,500 --> 0:07:24,660
 So now the sound is better, and people are closer to the microphone.

88
0:07:25,140 --> 0:07:26,620
 I guess we continue.

89
0:07:28,960 --> 0:07:34,160
 I went to the front page of wordpress.com, and there was no consent dialogue.

90
0:07:35,160 --> 0:07:37,360
 I click get started.

91
0:07:37,360 --> 0:07:37,560
 Okay.

92
0:07:37,560 --> 0:07:37,600
 Okay.

93
0:07:37,600 --> 0:07:37,620
 Okay.

94
0:07:37,620 --> 0:07:37,660
 Okay.

95
0:07:37,660 --> 0:07:37,720
 Okay.

96
0:07:37,720 --> 0:07:37,740
 Okay.

97
0:07:37,740 --> 0:07:37,760
 Okay.

98
0:07:37,760 --> 0:07:37,780
 Okay.

99
0:07:37,780 --> 0:07:37,840
 Okay.

100
0:07:37,840 --> 0:07:37,860
 Okay.

101
0:07:37,860 --> 0:07:37,900
 Okay.

102
0:07:37,900 --> 0:07:37,940
 Okay.

103
0:07:37,940 --> 0:07:37,960
 Okay.

104
0:07:37,960 --> 0:07:37,980
 Okay.

105
0:07:37,980 --> 0:07:38,000
 Okay.

106
0:07:38,000 --> 0:07:38,020
 Okay.

107
0:07:38,020 --> 0:07:38,060
 Okay.

108
0:07:38,060 --> 0:07:38,080
 Okay.

109
0:07:38,080 --> 0:07:38,100
 Okay.

110
0:07:38,100 --> 0:07:38,160
 Okay.

111
0:07:38,160 --> 0:07:38,200
 Okay.

112
0:07:38,600 --> 0:07:38,900
 Okay.

113
0:07:38,900 --> 0:07:39,060
 Okay.

114
0:07:39,060 --> 0:07:41,820
 I go to the second page, and then the consent dialogue pops up.

115
0:07:41,820 --> 0:07:47,220
 I think the designers of the web site decided that the consent dialogue is probably not

116
0:07:47,220 --> 0:07:52,340
 a good user experience, so they want to hide that on a secondary page.

117
0:07:52,340 --> 0:08:04,900
 I looked at the trackers, and they were the same on those two pages, as far as I could

118
0:08:04,900 --> 0:08:05,000
 tell.

119
0:08:05,440 --> 0:08:06,060
 And then of course, they have this silly thing where you need to generate a story where you

120
0:08:06,060 --> 0:08:06,600
 will know the text you want to have the new cerums.

121
0:08:06,600 --> 0:08:07,120
 No, no.

122
0:08:07,120 --> 0:08:07,160
 No.

123
0:08:07,160 --> 0:08:07,540
 No, no.

124
0:08:07,560 --> 0:08:07,580
 No.

125
0:08:07,580 --> 0:08:07,720
 No.

126
0:08:07,720 --> 0:08:07,780
 No.

127
0:08:07,780 --> 0:08:07,820
 No.

128
0:08:07,820 --> 0:08:08,280
 That's it.

129
0:08:08,280 --> 0:08:08,560
 No.

130
0:08:08,560 --> 0:08:16,700
 to click customize, and then you have to toggle something in order to actually reject it.

131
0:08:16,700 --> 0:08:22,760
 That's a pattern of, you know, trying to make people accept things, called a dark pattern

132
0:08:22,760 --> 0:08:32,180
 often. Then I have a different example here that is, like, really, that's when you go

133
0:08:32,180 --> 0:08:42,500
 to Bloomberg.com, it's a giant thing you have to either accept all or reject all. And

134
0:08:42,500 --> 0:08:51,200
 what I thought was very interesting about this one is a text that reads that you can

135
0:08:51,200 --> 0:09:02,160
 actually manage those choices any time, which I would understand that it's a good effect

136
0:09:02,160 --> 0:09:10,700
 for this dialogue. You can manage those choices any time you want, but that doesn't really

137
0:09:10,700 --> 0:09:14,160
 make sense, because if I go to the website again with a different browser session, how

138
0:09:14,160 --> 0:09:21,380
 am I going to manage those choices from the previous visit? It's bizarre. The link just

139
0:09:21,380 --> 0:09:29,480
 points to a generic page that's dependent on the cookie. So that's one of those real

140
0:09:29,480 --> 0:09:32,140
 absurdities of revoking.

141
0:09:32,140 --> 0:09:40,900
 Making cookie consent, like, how do you... You may need to actually store those cookies

142
0:09:40,900 --> 0:09:49,320
 yourself in order to revisit the sites. You may also need to have a log of your own IP

143
0:09:49,320 --> 0:09:53,660
 addresses you've been delegated and whatever goes into your fingerprint that's used for

144
0:09:53,660 --> 0:09:58,860
 this kind of ad profiling.

145
0:09:58,860 --> 0:10:02,120
 Looking at the... Looking at those terms and conditions, I think it's very important to

146
0:10:02,120 --> 0:10:06,900
 remember that the terms and conditions, those consent dialogues, they all contain something

147
0:10:06,900 --> 0:10:15,620
 about profiling. So that's not profiling that is explicit, but it says that it may contain

148
0:10:15,620 --> 0:10:22,460
 this and this and this element. And so in order to revoke it, I would post that then

149
0:10:22,460 --> 0:10:30,020
 the user needs to be able to know that about their own web browsing in order to, for instance,

150
0:10:30,020 --> 0:10:31,780
 invoke the right to be forgotten.

151
0:10:31,780 --> 0:10:43,880
 Or the right to have... To see your own data. All those individual GDPR rights. And that

152
0:10:43,880 --> 0:10:51,240
 is absurd. I think no one's going to do that. Even on the highest technical level, knowing

153
0:10:51,240 --> 0:10:59,100
 that and putting it into practice seems very far-fetched.

154
0:10:59,100 --> 0:11:01,160
 So some other absurdities that...

155
0:11:01,160 --> 0:11:03,220
 SIGNDAL

156
0:11:03,220 --> 0:11:04,160
 As Resources Engine.

157
0:11:04,160 --> 0:11:05,160
 SPEAKER 3

158
0:11:05,160 --> 0:11:06,220
 SAMUEL MITCHELL

159
0:11:06,220 --> 0:11:09,180
 That kind of Listenability's problem here is that we notice is that there is actually

160
0:11:09,180 --> 0:11:14,720
 a great HTTP header, do not track header, and it seems to me that it would be easier

161
0:11:14,720 --> 0:11:21,040
 if the ones that own websites instead would read that header, instead of letting everyone

162
0:11:21,040 --> 0:11:25,340
 have to read those awfully long terms and conditions. That's just a very simple solution

163
0:11:25,340 --> 0:11:31,140
 to not consent to tracking. And then if that header is set, you don't even have to show

164
0:11:31,160 --> 0:11:36,680
 show those dialogues, you can give the user a better experience.

165
0:11:36,680 --> 0:11:44,320
 And then there's browser extensions, kind of doing the same, let's say you own a website

166
0:11:44,320 --> 0:11:49,940
 and you can see that people are using tracker bloggers or ad bloggers, that's probably because

167
0:11:49,940 --> 0:11:56,020
 they do not consent to the tracking, right, so you don't need to show them the dialogue.

168
0:11:56,020 --> 0:12:00,780
 And then there is the very strange behavior of saying, like, if you continue browsing

169
0:12:00,780 --> 0:12:03,180
 this website, then you automatically agree.

170
0:12:03,180 --> 0:12:08,520
 Like how do you note that someone actually saw that dialogue?

171
0:12:08,520 --> 0:12:11,380
 And you might as well have missed it.

172
0:12:11,380 --> 0:12:13,980
 That's the case of the Bloomberg thing here.

173
0:12:13,980 --> 0:12:21,160
 They have in the background there, you can see there is a tiny, small, like yellow thing

174
0:12:21,160 --> 0:12:25,700
 that says that they have updated their terms and conditions and if you continue surfing

175
0:12:25,700 --> 0:12:25,800
 the site, you can see that they are updating their terms and conditions.

176
0:12:25,800 --> 0:12:25,900
 And if you continue surfing the site, you can see that they are updating their terms

177
0:12:25,900 --> 0:12:26,000
 and conditions.

178
0:12:26,000 --> 0:12:30,000
 And if you continue surfing the site, you just automatically agree to those changes.

179
0:12:30,000 --> 0:12:33,540
 Very strange, I would say.

180
0:12:33,540 --> 0:12:36,080
 Okay.

181
0:12:36,080 --> 0:12:39,320
 So let's be a little bit positive now.

182
0:12:39,320 --> 0:12:49,320
 I would say that there is maybe an okay thing to think about during the past, like GDPR

183
0:12:49,320 --> 0:12:55,000
 times and maybe the past, I don't know, maybe it's a decade now that the cookie banners

184
0:12:55,000 --> 0:12:55,880
 have been out.

185
0:12:55,880 --> 0:13:08,080
 But they did spread an awareness of tracking and so on in the larger population, right?

186
0:13:08,080 --> 0:13:11,380
 And maybe that's an advantage.

187
0:13:11,380 --> 0:13:19,060
 It could also be a disadvantage, though, because we get this, you know, this consent fatigue.

188
0:13:19,060 --> 0:13:22,000
 We have to look at way too many things and consent to them.

189
0:13:22,000 --> 0:13:24,760
 So of course, we just stop looking.

190
0:13:24,760 --> 0:13:25,760
 We stop caring.

191
0:13:25,760 --> 0:13:29,600
 And that's quite human.

192
0:13:29,600 --> 0:13:37,960
 Oh, this talk just keeps getting gloomier and gloomier.

193
0:13:37,960 --> 0:13:47,960
 So the normalizing is part of the fatigue, you could say, but it's also part of maybe

194
0:13:47,960 --> 0:13:51,640
 saying, you know, oh, this tracking, it's innocent.

195
0:13:51,640 --> 0:13:52,640
 Everyone does it.

196
0:13:52,640 --> 0:13:53,840
 Like, it's completely fine that we have a...

197
0:13:53,840 --> 0:13:54,840
 It's completely fine that we have a...

198
0:13:54,840 --> 0:14:05,000
 I think one of the cookie consent frameworks, they advertise that they automatically have

199
0:14:05,000 --> 0:14:14,560
 an updated list of 2,000 third-party tracking companies, data processors, it's quite a lot,

200
0:14:14,560 --> 0:14:18,680
 but then that's kind of just normal.

201
0:14:18,680 --> 0:14:23,680
 And I think even worse is like that.

202
0:14:23,680 --> 0:14:30,580
 We get a bit like nihilism is creeping in, like Big Tech is just doing whatever they

203
0:14:30,580 --> 0:14:35,360
 want with our data and we can't even read all these dialogues that we keep getting thrown

204
0:14:35,360 --> 0:14:37,560
 at us.

205
0:14:37,560 --> 0:14:40,040
 But yeah, good news.

206
0:14:40,040 --> 0:14:45,940
 I think that cookie consent is not really any consent thing.

207
0:14:45,940 --> 0:14:49,080
 Maybe we should find a better word for it.

208
0:14:49,080 --> 0:14:53,040
 It's very hard to claim that this is informed consent.

209
0:14:53,040 --> 0:14:53,060
 Maybe we should find a better word for it.

210
0:14:53,060 --> 0:14:53,140
 It's very hard to claim that this is informed consent.

211
0:14:53,680 --> 0:15:05,440
 And we already can see how like very explicit revocations of consent that are being indicated

212
0:15:05,440 --> 0:15:08,860
 in HTTP headers are being ignored.

213
0:15:08,860 --> 0:15:15,180
 And yes, I think I've argued the case that it's in practice it's not possible to revoke

214
0:15:15,180 --> 0:15:17,600
 this type of consent.

215
0:15:17,600 --> 0:15:28,540
 I asked a bit around, and I was happy to see that the general born hack audience in the

216
0:15:28,540 --> 0:15:36,360
 Fediverse also had a majority of saying let's reject this as a solution to tracking.

217
0:15:36,360 --> 0:15:42,240
 Like asking for consent in this way doesn't make tracking okay is how I would interpret

218
0:15:42,240 --> 0:15:44,600
 the response here.

219
0:15:44,600 --> 0:15:46,560
 But also that...

220
0:15:46,560 --> 0:15:47,560
 Yeah.

221
0:15:47,560 --> 0:15:52,380
 I think some people have kind of given up hope.

222
0:15:52,380 --> 0:16:00,560
 Some people also believe that we can improve cookie banners so that the consent can work.

223
0:16:00,560 --> 0:16:05,840
 I'd really like to hear from them also.

224
0:16:05,840 --> 0:16:14,040
 Let's say that we had a workshop and we could talk a bit more about our experiences with

225
0:16:14,040 --> 0:16:17,480
 both cookie consent, but also other types of consents where you...

226
0:16:17,480 --> 0:16:27,420
 I agree to some terms and conditions in a shop or with the public sector, then it would

227
0:16:27,420 --> 0:16:31,400
 be a great fit to ask these basic simple questions.

228
0:16:31,400 --> 0:16:36,320
 Is the consent I'm dealing with here, is it informed consent, meaning that the user knows

229
0:16:36,320 --> 0:16:46,140
 what's going on and how to withdraw that, and also the curious case because often this

230
0:16:46,140 --> 0:16:47,300
 legitimate interest is being...

231
0:16:47,300 --> 0:16:48,300
 Yeah.

232
0:16:48,300 --> 0:16:49,300
 ...mixed up.

233
0:16:49,300 --> 0:16:58,360
 Often there is a blurry line that looks like you have to consent to something, but actually

234
0:16:58,360 --> 0:17:00,100
 it's called legitimate interest.

235
0:17:00,100 --> 0:17:09,240
 But I'll try to come back to that, but that's a great idea for a workshop, I think, so I

236
0:17:09,240 --> 0:17:13,980
 hope someone would be interested in that too.

237
0:17:13,980 --> 0:17:15,240
 So moving on from the cookie banners.

238
0:17:15,240 --> 0:17:16,240
 Yeah.

239
0:17:16,240 --> 0:17:17,240
 Yeah.

240
0:17:17,240 --> 0:17:24,860
 So moving on from the cookie banners, let's try to define something.

241
0:17:24,860 --> 0:17:34,520
 Let's try to say what properties should real consent contain, and I don't know, strong

242
0:17:34,520 --> 0:17:39,720
 consent, true consent, just kind of trying to distance it from this mix-up with the cookie

243
0:17:39,720 --> 0:17:40,720
 banners.

244
0:17:40,720 --> 0:17:45,240
 First of all, real consent should be voluntary.

245
0:17:45,240 --> 0:17:46,240
 Yeah.

246
0:17:46,240 --> 0:17:53,480
 It's a voluntary thing, so if there is only one button called accept, and you need to

247
0:17:53,480 --> 0:18:00,420
 accept in order to access something, it's not consent, it's an agreement or it's like

248
0:18:00,420 --> 0:18:05,500
 the terms, but that's nothing to do with consent.

249
0:18:05,500 --> 0:18:13,500
 We want the term to have meaning, and that meaning comes when it's a voluntary declaration

250
0:18:13,500 --> 0:18:14,760
 or agreement between.

251
0:18:14,760 --> 0:18:15,760
 Yeah.

252
0:18:15,760 --> 0:18:16,280
 Yeah.

253
0:18:16,280 --> 0:18:19,180
 Two parties.

254
0:18:19,180 --> 0:18:25,200
 And secondly, it needs to be informed, so all this stuff about agreeing without reading,

255
0:18:25,200 --> 0:18:30,020
 we need to get into a situation where someone consenting to something actually has an incentive

256
0:18:30,020 --> 0:18:34,100
 to be informed about it.

257
0:18:34,100 --> 0:18:36,000
 Then it should be revocable.

258
0:18:36,000 --> 0:18:43,160
 That's also a very hard technical term, technical task, so to implement that a consent is suddenly

259
0:18:43,160 --> 0:18:44,380
 being revoked.

260
0:18:44,380 --> 0:18:48,620
 That could happen any time to the system, needs to get a signal, needs to do something,

261
0:18:48,620 --> 0:18:54,620
 needs to scrub data, maybe tell other systems that they need to do the same.

262
0:18:54,620 --> 0:18:58,060
 That can become quite complicated.

263
0:18:58,060 --> 0:19:00,620
 Then it needs to be manageable by the user.

264
0:19:00,620 --> 0:19:01,800
 So what does that mean?

265
0:19:01,800 --> 0:19:06,060
 That could mean that the user needs a copy of what they're consenting to, or they need

266
0:19:06,060 --> 0:19:11,160
 some kind of permanent access to the system.

267
0:19:11,160 --> 0:19:13,300
 Maybe they need to store it in a wallet.

268
0:19:13,300 --> 0:19:14,300
 Yeah.

269
0:19:14,300 --> 0:19:19,380
 There are many ways probably of implementing this.

270
0:19:19,380 --> 0:19:27,340
 And then it needs to be auditable, so we need to be able to say when we did this, and this

271
0:19:27,340 --> 0:19:35,020
 action requires consent, then we need to track the action in a way that we can prove that

272
0:19:35,020 --> 0:19:39,020
 we had the consent when we did that.

273
0:19:39,020 --> 0:19:42,080
 So it needs to be auditable by someone.

274
0:19:42,080 --> 0:19:43,740
 And especially when it comes to consent.

275
0:19:43,740 --> 0:19:50,780
 When it comes to GDPR, then users can at any point in time require that you show proof

276
0:19:50,780 --> 0:19:55,120
 that what you did was based on consent or legitimate interest.

277
0:19:55,120 --> 0:20:01,500
 But you need to be able to prove that.

278
0:20:01,500 --> 0:20:08,740
 And other functions from GDPR is this right to be forgotten and also the right to have

279
0:20:08,740 --> 0:20:11,740
 your data corrected and so on.

280
0:20:11,740 --> 0:20:12,740
 Good point.

281
0:20:12,740 --> 0:20:13,740
 Thank you.

282
0:20:13,740 --> 0:20:15,240
 It's good to have all of that.

283
0:20:15,240 --> 0:20:22,880
 And then it's a task now to implement.

284
0:20:22,880 --> 0:20:30,980
 I just want to show this table, though, because what we found when working with specification

285
0:20:30,980 --> 0:20:37,960
 for consent was that people working with other systems that needed consent, they were sometimes

286
0:20:37,960 --> 0:20:42,060
 confusing it with a normal agreement, but also they were asking the question, can we

287
0:20:42,060 --> 0:20:43,740
 also use this consent system?

288
0:20:43,740 --> 0:20:48,120
 Can we use it to store regular agreements, any kind of contract in?

289
0:20:48,120 --> 0:20:53,240
 And that's where the consent specification gets too muddy.

290
0:20:53,240 --> 0:21:00,920
 So we want to be strict on what is consent and what is something else like a regular

291
0:21:00,920 --> 0:21:01,920
 contract.

292
0:21:01,920 --> 0:21:05,540
 The first thing was this point of it being voluntary.

293
0:21:05,540 --> 0:21:10,080
 Like if there is a reject and an accept button, then we're good.

294
0:21:10,080 --> 0:21:11,080
 Then it's voluntary.

295
0:21:11,080 --> 0:21:12,080
 People can reject it.

296
0:21:12,080 --> 0:21:16,560
 The system understands the rejection.

297
0:21:16,560 --> 0:21:21,300
 Then we need to have a purpose declared, an intention.

298
0:21:21,300 --> 0:21:22,960
 That's kind of what consent does.

299
0:21:22,960 --> 0:21:32,940
 You say yes to something that then happens, probably also has expiry.

300
0:21:32,940 --> 0:21:39,680
 But with contracts and agreements, then you have more like requirements or obligations

301
0:21:39,680 --> 0:21:41,080
 that have to happen.

302
0:21:41,080 --> 0:21:42,080
 Yeah.

303
0:21:42,080 --> 0:21:46,600
 And they probably also will happen.

304
0:21:46,600 --> 0:21:52,240
 Because contracts and agreements, they have like things about what happens if you don't

305
0:21:52,240 --> 0:21:54,740
 do that.

306
0:21:54,740 --> 0:21:59,180
 It's a promise of some kind, whereas consent, the one that gives the consent can just revoke

307
0:21:59,180 --> 0:22:00,180
 it.

308
0:22:00,180 --> 0:22:02,360
 So I put those in contrast.

309
0:22:02,360 --> 0:22:09,200
 And then the auditable part is something where I would say that the contract and agreement

310
0:22:09,200 --> 0:22:10,560
 often is signed in a way that in itself, it becomes a contract.

311
0:22:10,560 --> 0:22:11,560
 It becomes a contract.

312
0:22:11,560 --> 0:22:19,040
 It becomes the object that upholds its own content, where the consent relates to a lot

313
0:22:19,040 --> 0:22:29,180
 of actions that need to prove that they are related to that particular consent.

314
0:22:29,180 --> 0:22:40,100
 So some examples that are not cookie banners is that government, for instance, I'll just

315
0:22:40,100 --> 0:22:41,060
 mention the two last ones.

316
0:22:41,060 --> 0:22:41,120
 I'll just mention the two last ones.

317
0:22:41,120 --> 0:22:41,220
 I'll just mention the two last ones.

318
0:22:41,220 --> 0:22:51,500
 But a very typical government institution will want to get your personal data from a

319
0:22:51,500 --> 0:22:57,840
 registry somewhere or exchange data in some kind of way to do an administrative task.

320
0:22:57,840 --> 0:23:00,500
 That needs consent often.

321
0:23:00,500 --> 0:23:02,440
 But that's because you can reject it.

322
0:23:02,440 --> 0:23:05,400
 So if you reject it, you replace it with another process.

323
0:23:05,400 --> 0:23:10,780
 Then you can just like give them the information by showing your ID or by fetching it from

324
0:23:10,780 --> 0:23:14,980
 somewhere and manually handing it over and so on.

325
0:23:14,980 --> 0:23:20,100
 Another example is communication where you accept that someone sends you a newsletter

326
0:23:20,100 --> 0:23:25,440
 and when you withdraw that consent, they stop sending you the newsletter.

327
0:23:25,440 --> 0:23:30,020
 And then the one sending out the newsletter can, of course, store like now I sent to these

328
0:23:30,020 --> 0:23:32,160
 people based on this consent.

329
0:23:32,160 --> 0:23:35,540
 You can anonymize or hash the email addresses.

330
0:23:35,540 --> 0:23:37,780
 So you can build a nice little system that's consent-based.

331
0:23:37,780 --> 0:23:38,780
 And then you can send out the newsletter.

332
0:23:38,780 --> 0:23:39,780
 And then the one sending out the newsletter can, of course, store like now I sent to these

333
0:23:39,780 --> 0:23:40,780
 people based on this consent.

334
0:23:40,780 --> 0:23:48,720
 And actually, it's the subscribe-unsubscribe function of the newsletter.

335
0:23:48,720 --> 0:23:56,420
 So when we build this, we need to ask some questions like in order to establish informed

336
0:23:56,420 --> 0:24:01,400
 consent, there are some risks.

337
0:24:01,400 --> 0:24:09,540
 And the best example of consent when it comes to risks is medical consent.

338
0:24:09,540 --> 0:24:10,740
 There will be a lot of risks.

339
0:24:10,740 --> 0:24:14,120
 There are risks implied with a medical procedure.

340
0:24:14,120 --> 0:24:19,500
 And if the patient is conscious, you want informed consent.

341
0:24:19,500 --> 0:24:24,940
 And they are incentivized to read it because the risks are very high.

342
0:24:24,940 --> 0:24:32,700
 Whereas in the example of data exchange, the user can perceive no risk at all and not want

343
0:24:32,700 --> 0:24:33,700
 to read it.

344
0:24:33,700 --> 0:24:39,840
 And that's where it gets a little bit more of a UX task, like how do we present this

345
0:24:39,840 --> 0:24:40,680
 thing?

346
0:24:40,680 --> 0:24:47,680
 So the user actually perceives an incentive to go through it.

347
0:24:47,680 --> 0:24:54,020
 And that's a task not just for the legal department.

348
0:24:54,020 --> 0:24:58,200
 I think if you just ask the legal department to do the whole consent thing, you're going

349
0:24:58,200 --> 0:24:59,860
 to get a legal text.

350
0:24:59,860 --> 0:25:04,500
 And then you will have the problem of turning the legal text into informed consent.

351
0:25:04,500 --> 0:25:10,060
 You need something that feeds people an understanding of the purpose and the risks and so on.

352
0:25:10,680 --> 0:25:17,660
 And then the last part is also to ask, like, is any of this in the user's interest?

353
0:25:17,660 --> 0:25:19,980
 Maybe ask that.

354
0:25:19,980 --> 0:25:25,640
 And then if the answer is no, then ask if consent is really the solution then, if you're

355
0:25:25,640 --> 0:25:30,820
 doing something against the user's interest or not zero interest in it.

356
0:25:30,820 --> 0:25:37,240
 It's hard to push in consent because it will not be informed consent.

357
0:25:37,240 --> 0:25:39,680
 So try to put this proposal.

358
0:25:39,680 --> 0:25:40,680
 Kind of.

359
0:25:40,680 --> 0:25:42,780
 It's a little bit academic.

360
0:25:42,780 --> 0:25:50,900
 That consent is understood as a voluntary, well informed and revocable declaration by

361
0:25:50,900 --> 0:25:58,800
 an individual for another party to use and process that data in a specific way.

362
0:25:58,800 --> 0:26:09,660
 And we have established a similar definition in a project that I'm part of that is government

363
0:26:09,660 --> 0:26:10,660
 oriented.

364
0:26:10,680 --> 0:26:13,580
 It's a little bit like a slightly simpler version of it.

365
0:26:13,580 --> 0:26:19,480
 So before giving the talk, I decided to add some more to the definition to make sure it's

366
0:26:19,480 --> 0:26:21,980
 like a good and strong definition.

367
0:26:21,980 --> 0:26:35,760
 So then in this project called GovStack, where we are working with a specification for consent,

368
0:26:35,760 --> 0:26:38,780
 we have also had to add something.

369
0:26:38,780 --> 0:26:39,860
 So like as an example.

370
0:26:39,860 --> 0:26:44,580
 An example of what consent is not.

371
0:26:44,580 --> 0:26:53,680
 And that's like the second clause to the definition is, let's say, the use of consent should be

372
0:26:53,680 --> 0:26:56,540
 avoided in these cases.

373
0:26:56,540 --> 0:27:03,960
 When a person is simply informed by an organization, it's like it's just an information and you

374
0:27:03,960 --> 0:27:07,360
 cannot project it or whatever.

375
0:27:07,360 --> 0:27:08,860
 And when the consent.

376
0:27:08,860 --> 0:27:18,480
 It's like a system or a platform that is dealing with consent has no way to identify the person.

377
0:27:18,480 --> 0:27:24,580
 Or like has no way to establish the consent is actually real.

378
0:27:24,580 --> 0:27:29,920
 Because then the owner of the consent platform can also suddenly like invent consent.

379
0:27:29,920 --> 0:27:32,420
 That's not so good.

380
0:27:32,420 --> 0:27:37,060
 So we want a system that's like tied up to some other system that can ensure that there

381
0:27:37,060 --> 0:27:37,980
 is a signature.

382
0:27:37,980 --> 0:27:38,580
 So something like that.

383
0:27:38,580 --> 0:27:43,520
 So some kind of stamp on the consent.

384
0:27:43,520 --> 0:27:48,740
 I'll get back to the data models for this because now is the time for getting closer

385
0:27:48,740 --> 0:27:56,340
 to I've made a typo there for the specification for digital consent.

386
0:27:56,340 --> 0:28:02,120
 And I have copy pasted the typo to each and every of the following slides.

387
0:28:02,120 --> 0:28:07,380
 So the high level requirement is to say we need privacy by design and privacy by default.

388
0:28:07,380 --> 0:28:08,380
 I hope that you've heard that.

389
0:28:08,380 --> 0:28:15,240
 I hope that you've heard the terms before because I just really like those terms and

390
0:28:15,240 --> 0:28:21,440
 they're a very good starting point for specifying the system.

391
0:28:21,440 --> 0:28:29,700
 And in privacy by design, we want to say we start to design our whole system of data models,

392
0:28:29,700 --> 0:28:35,320
 not just the consent models, but also in the rest of the system when something has to do

393
0:28:35,320 --> 0:28:36,320
 with consent.

394
0:28:36,320 --> 0:28:37,520
 We need to sort of plug in.

395
0:28:37,520 --> 0:28:38,220
 We need to plug in.

396
0:28:38,220 --> 0:28:45,480
 We need to plug it into our consent system so that we know what to do when consent expires.

397
0:28:45,480 --> 0:28:52,660
 So like do things based on the fact that consent should exist.

398
0:28:52,660 --> 0:28:56,580
 If you are doing an operation in a system, maybe you need to check for the consent before

399
0:28:56,580 --> 0:28:59,980
 even proceeding.

400
0:28:59,980 --> 0:29:02,840
 That could be a way.

401
0:29:02,840 --> 0:29:04,980
 Then we also want the privacy by default.

402
0:29:04,980 --> 0:29:06,780
 So that's very simple with this.

403
0:29:06,780 --> 0:29:08,180
 Like we just assume that the user.

404
0:29:08,180 --> 0:29:10,600
 The user hasn't consented.

405
0:29:10,600 --> 0:29:11,940
 That's how we design the whole system.

406
0:29:11,940 --> 0:29:12,940
 There is no consent.

407
0:29:12,940 --> 0:29:19,280
 And then we have the entire track of how the system should work without the consent.

408
0:29:19,280 --> 0:29:29,760
 So the advantage is that actually consent can be a liability in itself if you're storing

409
0:29:29,760 --> 0:29:37,500
 a lot of consent with person-identifiable information next to the consent, then the

410
0:29:37,500 --> 0:29:45,560
 consent system in itself contains things that are privacy-related.

411
0:29:45,560 --> 0:29:50,980
 And if people are rejecting something and you are then storing their rejection, then

412
0:29:50,980 --> 0:29:55,660
 you're storing the fact that this person doesn't want to do this.

413
0:29:55,660 --> 0:30:04,920
 So we can get rid of that by defaulting to having a rejection state.

414
0:30:04,920 --> 0:30:06,960
 Okay.

415
0:30:06,960 --> 0:30:22,360
 We did some work in the GovStack project, and these are five pillars of the work.

416
0:30:22,360 --> 0:30:28,000
 Firstly we have done this based on some use cases.

417
0:30:28,000 --> 0:30:36,320
 And the first use case is related to a mother and child that goes to a health care center.

418
0:30:36,320 --> 0:30:44,300
 And how this child is being registered in the health care center.

419
0:30:44,300 --> 0:30:53,400
 And the second one is about payment in a public sector also.

420
0:30:53,400 --> 0:30:56,140
 So benefits, you can say.

421
0:30:56,140 --> 0:31:03,180
 And how to do those payouts and sort of manage data around citizens.

422
0:31:03,180 --> 0:31:05,520
 We're not quite there yet.

423
0:31:05,520 --> 0:31:09,720
 There's a lot of complexity in this.

424
0:31:09,720 --> 0:31:16,700
 But we've started now to have enough that we can say that we have a functional specification

425
0:31:16,700 --> 0:31:18,880
 for the most simple things.

426
0:31:18,880 --> 0:31:26,780
 And there are some requirements, some UX requirements, some data models, and an open API specification.

427
0:31:26,780 --> 0:31:31,440
 In the functional requirements, you need the administration part of the system.

428
0:31:31,440 --> 0:31:35,500
 Someone needs to be able to configure and set up a system.

429
0:31:35,520 --> 0:31:37,220
 Everything.

430
0:31:37,220 --> 0:31:43,000
 So the administrator or configuration owner, those are the ones that are responsible for

431
0:31:43,000 --> 0:31:51,500
 adding things that are like the texts that the user sees and should be able to update

432
0:31:51,500 --> 0:31:55,500
 those texts and see how things work out.

433
0:31:55,500 --> 0:31:59,720
 Maybe mass reject everything when the consent is updated.

434
0:31:59,720 --> 0:32:03,720
 The administrator also needs to be able to configure.

435
0:32:03,720 --> 0:32:04,720
 And that's what we're trying to do.

436
0:32:04,720 --> 0:32:04,920
 Okay.

437
0:32:04,920 --> 0:32:05,120
 Thank you.

438
0:32:05,120 --> 0:32:05,220
 Thank you.

439
0:32:05,220 --> 0:32:05,320
 Thank you.

440
0:32:05,320 --> 0:32:05,420
 Thank you.

441
0:32:05,420 --> 0:32:05,520
 Thank you.

442
0:32:05,520 --> 0:32:05,640
 Okay.

443
0:32:06,840 --> 0:32:06,880
 All right.

444
0:32:06,880 --> 0:32:06,920
 Thank you.

445
0:32:06,920 --> 0:32:14,700
 Then we've got the general policy, privacy policy, that guides maybe all the handling

446
0:32:14,700 --> 0:32:16,560
 of data inside the organization.

447
0:32:16,760 --> 0:32:19,660
 So we've got a bunch of functionality there.

448
0:32:20,400 --> 0:32:33,700
 Then we've got the individual user who is in need of seeing her consent agreement, as

449
0:32:33,700 --> 0:32:34,200
 we call it.

450
0:32:34,500 --> 0:32:35,120
 So being...

451
0:32:35,120 --> 0:32:35,220
 So being a...

452
0:32:35,220 --> 0:32:42,980
 being presented by something to consent to, and then actually accepting or rejecting that.

453
0:32:42,980 --> 0:32:52,220
 What we're used to seeing is like mega collections of a million things to toggle on and off,

454
0:32:52,220 --> 0:32:56,720
 and we've just kind of envisioned that there is one thing at a time, and then you click

455
0:32:56,720 --> 0:33:06,780
 accept or reject, and of course, they need to be able to look at what they have consented

456
0:33:06,780 --> 0:33:16,200
 to later, and they need to be able to send revocations for things later in time.

457
0:33:16,200 --> 0:33:18,480
 So it's kind of obvious.

458
0:33:18,480 --> 0:33:20,820
 The other part is not so obvious.

459
0:33:20,820 --> 0:33:26,140
 That's the auditing part, and we've kept that separate.

460
0:33:26,140 --> 0:33:26,700
 From the audit part, we've kept that separate.

461
0:33:26,700 --> 0:33:27,840
 From the audit part, we've kept that separate.

462
0:33:27,840 --> 0:33:35,660
 System administration and users' individual functions.

463
0:33:35,660 --> 0:33:47,700
 So this is an area that I think we will have a lot of future work with, and kind of understanding

464
0:33:47,700 --> 0:33:53,480
 this whole aspect of what does auditing versus privacy mean, like what are we actually now

465
0:33:53,480 --> 0:33:56,120
 delegating the auditor to have access to?

466
0:33:56,120 --> 0:34:04,940
 Auditing can also happen through that someone looks into the consent system to see what

467
0:34:04,940 --> 0:34:09,260
 is stored in the system, but it can also happen that auditors should be able to access the

468
0:34:09,260 --> 0:34:14,740
 system that is doing stuff based on consent to see that things matches.

469
0:34:14,740 --> 0:34:19,960
 Auditing can also be that a third party is owning copies of what is happening in this

470
0:34:19,960 --> 0:34:25,000
 consent platform, and then able to do their own auditing afterwards.

471
0:34:25,000 --> 0:34:25,960
 We've tried not to.

472
0:34:25,960 --> 0:34:32,200
 We've tried not to specify exactly how that happens, but to have a larger palette for

473
0:34:32,200 --> 0:34:35,720
 that.

474
0:34:35,720 --> 0:34:42,520
 Then we have the UX requirements, which I really wanted to have shown some of the mockups,

475
0:34:42,520 --> 0:34:44,560
 but I didn't have the latest copy.

476
0:34:44,560 --> 0:34:48,740
 But it's fairly simple requirements.

477
0:34:48,740 --> 0:34:53,820
 I think that's the common sense that you would have if you thought about consent from your

478
0:34:53,820 --> 0:34:54,820
 own perspective.

479
0:34:54,820 --> 0:34:55,840
 Like, how would I like to be able to do this?

480
0:34:55,840 --> 0:34:59,400
 How would I like to be asked?

481
0:34:59,400 --> 0:35:05,680
 The first requirement that I really liked in this UX specification was that we want

482
0:35:05,680 --> 0:35:11,600
 to just be clear about what data do we need, or what are we doing here?

483
0:35:11,600 --> 0:35:18,520
 Why are we doing it, and what does the user benefit from this or risk from it?

484
0:35:18,520 --> 0:35:20,600
 And then the duration is also really important.

485
0:35:20,600 --> 0:35:25,380
 Like, is this indefinite, or is it just some data that we have for a week, and then we

486
0:35:25,380 --> 0:35:26,380
 nuke it again?

487
0:35:26,380 --> 0:35:33,940
 Super nice things to be reminded of, and I think that reading the UX specification can

488
0:35:33,940 --> 0:35:44,380
 even end up being the entry point for understanding this platform, however it's made up.

489
0:35:44,380 --> 0:35:51,660
 They also had a really nice note in the UX requirements, which is kind of a different

490
0:35:51,660 --> 0:35:52,940
 take on what I have said earlier.

491
0:35:52,940 --> 0:35:53,940
 That the system...

492
0:35:53,940 --> 0:35:54,940
 If the user...

493
0:35:54,940 --> 0:36:00,280
 If the users reject the consent request, then the ones that are designing UX for a whole

494
0:36:00,280 --> 0:36:05,320
 application, they need to actually have a user journey where the consent is rejected.

495
0:36:05,320 --> 0:36:10,520
 Many people always think how people would like to use their system in the accept kind

496
0:36:10,520 --> 0:36:16,440
 of scenario, and then they forget that there is also a user journey where consent has been

497
0:36:16,440 --> 0:36:22,700
 rejected.

498
0:36:22,700 --> 0:36:24,440
 Very important also.

499
0:36:24,440 --> 0:36:31,880
 When you're having the first exchange with the user and showing we need your consent

500
0:36:31,880 --> 0:36:34,820
 here, of course, it should be visible.

501
0:36:34,820 --> 0:36:38,180
 What do you do then if you change your mind?

502
0:36:38,180 --> 0:36:45,260
 I've also seen UX mockups that actually lodge a consent dialogue in a survey all the way

503
0:36:45,260 --> 0:36:46,260
 through the survey.

504
0:36:46,260 --> 0:36:51,480
 So you start by saying, yes, I can accept this, but then as you're asked more and more

505
0:36:51,480 --> 0:36:53,340
 questions in the survey, you're reminded that...

506
0:36:53,340 --> 0:36:54,340
 Oh, no.

507
0:36:54,340 --> 0:37:01,960
 Now I'm sharing this data, now I'm sharing this data, so then you can actually reject

508
0:37:01,960 --> 0:37:06,020
 having your personal details attached to the answer or something like that.

509
0:37:06,020 --> 0:37:15,720
 But have this information about changing your mind visible and have first class user interface

510
0:37:15,720 --> 0:37:18,580
 for it.

511
0:37:18,580 --> 0:37:23,720
 So then we had some data.

512
0:37:24,340 --> 0:37:29,100
 We had some data models, and now is the time that I can again say that I'm a software developer,

513
0:37:29,100 --> 0:37:35,340
 so I kind of want to get to this step because then I know what to do.

514
0:37:35,340 --> 0:37:43,300
 And this was the most simple version we could come up with to just show what are the general

515
0:37:43,300 --> 0:37:46,220
 entities in the system.

516
0:37:46,220 --> 0:37:48,580
 We have this configuration area.

517
0:37:48,580 --> 0:37:55,220
 That's where we manage the components of consent.

518
0:37:55,220 --> 0:38:06,320
 So then we have the individual models that store the consent of the individuals to something.

519
0:38:06,320 --> 0:38:10,700
 And our terminology is that...

520
0:38:10,700 --> 0:38:14,580
 And this is the core of building this system.

521
0:38:14,580 --> 0:38:15,580
 It's to understand this.

522
0:38:15,580 --> 0:38:16,580
 And this is the core of building this system.

523
0:38:16,580 --> 0:38:17,580
 It's to understand this.

524
0:38:17,580 --> 0:38:18,580
 And this is the core of building this system.

525
0:38:18,580 --> 0:38:19,580
 And this is the core of building this system.

526
0:38:19,580 --> 0:38:20,580
 And this is the core of building this system.

527
0:38:20,580 --> 0:38:25,400
 So this is data models, because then I think we'll go to a nice place where consent makes

528
0:38:25,400 --> 0:38:32,700
 sense, or at least makes more sense, is to model with a data policy.

529
0:38:32,700 --> 0:38:35,660
 So that's your general policy for data.

530
0:38:35,660 --> 0:38:39,420
 Keep that separate.

531
0:38:39,420 --> 0:38:45,820
 And then the consent agreement itself, which is the purpose, what data and why and for

532
0:38:45,820 --> 0:38:47,580
 how long and so on.

533
0:38:47,580 --> 0:38:55,520
 some properties. We call that a consent agreement. And then we have a consent record. So a consent

534
0:38:55,520 --> 0:39:03,420
 record, as you can see with the arrow, that's the link between an individual and a consent

535
0:39:03,420 --> 0:39:11,240
 agreement stating that the individual has consented to it. And now, of course, I should

536
0:39:11,240 --> 0:39:16,560
 say that we have a model that's called individual, but whether or not it's a natural person,

537
0:39:16,560 --> 0:39:24,460
 that doesn't matter to this system. It can be any kind of unique. If it's just an email

538
0:39:24,460 --> 0:39:32,820
 address, many just contains a hash of the email address, and then that's all the system

539
0:39:32,820 --> 0:39:42,900
 knows. So, we also have the data. We have a data

540
0:39:42,900 --> 0:39:45,980
 provider, a consumer or a processor.

541
0:39:45,980 --> 0:39:46,540
 Maybe....

542
0:39:46,540 --> 0:39:54,840
 But they also need to be able to look at consent in order to determine if the operation that

543
0:39:54,840 --> 0:39:59,240
 they are doing has consent stored.

544
0:39:59,240 --> 0:40:06,100
 Then there is also a procedure, of course, that makes sure that the system can return

545
0:40:06,100 --> 0:40:13,780
 yes or no, but not necessarily state whether the user exists or not.

546
0:40:13,780 --> 0:40:20,580
 It's an API, basically.

547
0:40:20,580 --> 0:40:22,840
 So I really like this slide.

548
0:40:22,840 --> 0:40:23,840
 I think that's...

549
0:40:23,840 --> 0:40:27,100
 Sorry it took so long to get here.

550
0:40:27,100 --> 0:40:37,180
 But if you have any questions around it, then be sure to ask them if we have time.

551
0:40:37,180 --> 0:40:43,280
 Now I'll just make it a little bit worse, because I thought this was okay simple.

552
0:40:43,280 --> 0:40:43,780
 Okay.

553
0:40:43,780 --> 0:40:49,320
 And add a little bit.

554
0:40:49,320 --> 0:40:56,540
 What I'm adding here is the auditing part, because what we are especially interested

555
0:40:56,540 --> 0:41:04,660
 in is that if the user changes their mind, or the consent agreement changes, or the data

556
0:41:04,660 --> 0:41:08,160
 policy changes, then we need to track that.

557
0:41:08,160 --> 0:41:12,340
 Otherwise, we don't know anything about the past.

558
0:41:12,340 --> 0:41:13,780
 So in the specification...

559
0:41:13,780 --> 0:41:21,420
 We have proposed that there is a revisioning system that can track things, if it's okay

560
0:41:21,420 --> 0:41:24,400
 to track them.

561
0:41:24,400 --> 0:41:27,720
 And we have signatures.

562
0:41:27,720 --> 0:41:35,380
 And if there is a way for the individual to actually sign their consent, of course they

563
0:41:35,380 --> 0:41:38,460
 should be able to do that, especially if it's the public sector.

564
0:41:38,460 --> 0:41:43,280
 They have all sorts of platforms for that.

565
0:41:43,780 --> 0:41:54,720
 And we've also added the lifecycle.

566
0:41:54,720 --> 0:42:02,200
 And preparing the system, the specification, was a way of understanding that consent has

567
0:42:02,200 --> 0:42:08,500
 a lifecycle from where it hatches in a legal department, maybe, that says, we need this,

568
0:42:08,500 --> 0:42:13,280
 and then in a place where the whole...

569
0:42:13,280 --> 0:42:17,420
 The whole legal aspect of it maybe is being prepared.

570
0:42:17,420 --> 0:42:24,660
 And then people interact with the system, but it may get used, it may change.

571
0:42:24,660 --> 0:42:27,160
 That's why we have the revisioning.

572
0:42:27,160 --> 0:42:33,600
 And finally, we need to be able to establish proofs, both so that systems that are using

573
0:42:33,600 --> 0:42:39,880
 it can see that there is consent, and so that auditing can see that.

574
0:42:39,880 --> 0:42:42,220
 So this high-level view is also...

575
0:42:42,220 --> 0:42:43,280
 Okay.

576
0:42:43,280 --> 0:42:49,800
 Turned into an open API specification where it's like specific schemas with specific fields,

577
0:42:49,800 --> 0:42:52,020
 so that's very nice.

578
0:42:52,020 --> 0:42:58,200
 All of this is just a specification, though, so it's not an actual tool.

579
0:42:58,200 --> 0:43:03,060
 So I want to go further now, because...

580
0:43:03,060 --> 0:43:10,180
 What I think we are ready to do is to take this specification, build an open source tool

581
0:43:10,180 --> 0:43:11,220
 that is...

582
0:43:11,220 --> 0:43:12,420
 Not necessarily...

583
0:43:12,420 --> 0:43:16,180
 Not necessarily for governments.

584
0:43:16,180 --> 0:43:18,260
 That's probably very heavy.

585
0:43:18,260 --> 0:43:23,240
 But at least can work for organizations that we are dealing with in our everyday life that

586
0:43:23,240 --> 0:43:30,580
 wants to ask our users simple things, like send a newsletter or store some information,

587
0:43:30,580 --> 0:43:36,260
 because we want to do a statistic in our organization about something.

588
0:43:36,260 --> 0:43:39,420
 Let's have a tool that can do that the right way.

589
0:43:39,420 --> 0:43:40,420
 And...

590
0:43:40,420 --> 0:43:41,420
 Okay.

591
0:43:41,420 --> 0:43:42,420
 Okay.

592
0:43:42,420 --> 0:43:43,420
 Okay.

593
0:43:43,420 --> 0:43:49,680
 I thought that since I'm from the Django world, I thought that we can build it with Django,

594
0:43:49,680 --> 0:43:55,240
 because it's so nice to write data models in Django, and it's kind of like a rapid thing,

595
0:43:55,240 --> 0:44:06,180
 so we can get quickly from prototype to something that we can implement in a real project.

596
0:44:06,180 --> 0:44:11,180
 And I hope that this platform will turn into something that can both be a standalone platform,

597
0:44:11,180 --> 0:44:11,980
 that has an API.

598
0:44:11,980 --> 0:44:16,440
 So that you don't need to use Django in order to use the application here.

599
0:44:16,440 --> 0:44:21,480
 But if you use Django, then you can also do some added things.

600
0:44:21,480 --> 0:44:28,400
 So especially I'm thinking about adding a specific Django consent field that data models

601
0:44:28,400 --> 0:44:33,980
 can say, I'm a row in a database that's based on consent.

602
0:44:33,980 --> 0:44:39,640
 And if the consent changes, then I want to be deleted, or I want to be...

603
0:44:39,640 --> 0:44:40,980
 Have this particular field anonymized.

604
0:44:40,980 --> 0:44:41,980
 Okay.

605
0:44:41,980 --> 0:44:44,160
 So whatever that can...

606
0:44:44,160 --> 0:44:50,140
 And people have been playing around with this before, but I found that the older tools were

607
0:44:50,140 --> 0:44:56,000
 based on GDPR understandings, and they were kind of abandoned now.

608
0:44:56,000 --> 0:45:04,160
 So the idea was to start the project and have these thoughts around the consent definition

609
0:45:04,160 --> 0:45:10,740
 and specification from GovStack used as a way to bootstrap the project.

610
0:45:10,740 --> 0:45:11,740
 So it has a...

611
0:45:11,740 --> 0:45:13,920
 It has a repository.

612
0:45:13,920 --> 0:45:17,800
 I just added a matrix channel today.

613
0:45:17,800 --> 0:45:22,800
 So if you're interested in joining that channel, and just...

614
0:45:22,800 --> 0:45:26,800
 You can use it to get updated on how it's going with the project, and you're also very

615
0:45:26,800 --> 0:45:30,980
 welcome to participate in it.

616
0:45:30,980 --> 0:45:37,740
 And then I wanted to add that I'm here, but only today at the event.

617
0:45:37,740 --> 0:45:38,740
 So I hope you enjoyed that.

618
0:45:38,740 --> 0:45:39,740
 Thank you.

619
0:45:39,740 --> 0:45:40,740
 Bye-bye.

620
0:45:40,740 --> 0:45:41,740
 Bye-bye.

621
0:45:41,740 --> 0:45:42,740
 Bye-bye.

622
0:45:42,740 --> 0:45:43,740
 Sorry.

623
0:45:43,740 --> 0:45:44,740
 You have to grab me to talk some more about consent.

624
0:45:44,740 --> 0:45:45,740
 Maybe here.

625
0:45:45,740 --> 0:45:46,740
 Maybe in the back.

626
0:45:46,740 --> 0:45:47,740
 I will use your input.

627
0:45:47,740 --> 0:45:48,740
 I hope that's okay.

628
0:45:48,740 --> 0:45:54,740
 So if you tell me something about how you think about consent, I will definitely get

629
0:45:54,740 --> 0:45:59,200
 inspired and try it and use that.

630
0:45:59,200 --> 0:46:02,400
 If you want to get involved in the project, that would be super awesome.

631
0:46:02,400 --> 0:46:09,920
 And my last recommendation here is that there is a super nice little episode of all hail

632
0:46:09,920 --> 0:46:10,940
 and всем ... maod.

633
0:46:11,740 --> 0:46:18,840
 the algorithm, which is an Al Jazeera series, that some years ago actually took up the point

634
0:46:18,840 --> 0:46:26,660
 of concept and really communicates it super well, makes it exciting and makes it essential

635
0:46:26,660 --> 0:46:31,340
 for everyday folks.

636
0:46:31,340 --> 0:46:34,860
 I take questions if there are any.

637
0:46:34,860 --> 0:46:35,860
 Thank you.

638
0:46:35,860 --> 0:46:45,080
 Do we have any questions for Benjamin?

639
0:46:45,080 --> 0:46:50,800
 We talked about this a bit earlier, but it seems to me the biggest players in the game

640
0:46:50,800 --> 0:46:58,460
 of tracking people's PII have a vested interest in not really getting consent from people

641
0:46:58,460 --> 0:47:02,960
 and patterns of behavior that indicate that they're not really interested in informed

642
0:47:02,960 --> 0:47:03,960
 user consent.

643
0:47:03,960 --> 0:47:04,960
 They're interested in mainstream consent.

644
0:47:04,960 --> 0:47:05,840
 They're interested in mainstream consent.

645
0:47:05,840 --> 0:47:10,020
 They're interested in maintaining their status quo and finding loopholes that allow them to

646
0:47:10,020 --> 0:47:11,020
 continue doing that.

647
0:47:11,020 --> 0:47:16,400
 And I think it's great that we think about how we can serve our users and how we can

648
0:47:16,400 --> 0:47:23,900
 respect their data and their privacy, but it feels to me like the biggest problem is

649
0:47:23,900 --> 0:47:29,020
 these bigger organizations that aren't going to play ball no matter what solutions exist.

650
0:47:29,020 --> 0:47:34,800
 And I was wondering what you think about that and ways that you see of affecting a more

651
0:47:34,800 --> 0:47:35,800
 positive change.

652
0:47:35,800 --> 0:47:40,980
 Given those actors, like Google, Facebook, other tech.

653
0:47:40,980 --> 0:47:43,240
 Yeah.

654
0:47:43,240 --> 0:47:45,820
 That's a really great question.

655
0:47:45,820 --> 0:47:50,920
 I think there is some kind of tactical political game buried here that maybe we should stop

656
0:47:50,920 --> 0:47:57,120
 even allowing them the right to use the word consent for these cookie banners.

657
0:47:57,120 --> 0:48:00,060
 Maybe it's better to just say cookie banners.

658
0:48:00,060 --> 0:48:03,880
 And then if we can get as far as building a tool that deals with this, I think it's really

659
0:48:03,880 --> 0:48:04,880
 important.

660
0:48:04,880 --> 0:48:05,640
 Yeah.

661
0:48:05,640 --> 0:48:05,680
 Yeah.

662
0:48:05,680 --> 0:48:05,760
 Yeah.

663
0:48:05,760 --> 0:48:05,780
 Yeah.

664
0:48:05,800 --> 0:48:07,380
 And if we can get as far as building a tool that deals with real consent, I think we'll

665
0:48:07,380 --> 0:48:11,820
 discover that the tool is absolutely useless for the type of data sharing that cookie banners

666
0:48:11,820 --> 0:48:12,820
 are used for.

667
0:48:12,820 --> 0:48:18,400
 So we'll just have a great tool that is great for actual consent and then it's easier to

668
0:48:18,400 --> 0:48:21,620
 see the differences.

669
0:48:21,620 --> 0:48:30,640
 If that can work as a strategy, I would pick that because it's always nice to be able to

670
0:48:30,640 --> 0:48:35,760
 show like the real consent.

671
0:48:35,760 --> 0:48:43,540
 And, yes, they will not, I mean, I'm pretty sure that at some point someone's going to

672
0:48:43,540 --> 0:48:48,160
 make a proposal in the European Parliament because now it has, it's not the same Parliament

673
0:48:48,160 --> 0:48:53,300
 that gave us GDPR, it's a different Parliament, and someone's going to say, look at this.

674
0:48:53,300 --> 0:48:54,300
 This is absurd.

675
0:48:54,300 --> 0:48:58,240
 Let's get rid of it and go back to the good old days where we just shared data without

676
0:48:58,240 --> 0:49:00,040
 even having the cookie banners.

677
0:49:00,040 --> 0:49:05,200
 I mean, maybe that could even be better for actually having consent now that everyone

678
0:49:05,200 --> 0:49:05,640
 understands it.

679
0:49:05,640 --> 0:49:13,780
 It's kind of weird to have a cookie banner that you just kind of know that it's being

680
0:49:13,780 --> 0:49:19,880
 mismanaged and it's not really authentic, so, yeah, that's...

681
0:49:19,880 --> 0:49:24,560
 Do you have one more question?

682
0:49:24,560 --> 0:49:25,560
 Thank you.

683
0:49:25,560 --> 0:49:30,700
 I had a similar thought, but I think during the presentation you, without intending, proposed

684
0:49:30,700 --> 0:49:35,420
 an approach to dealing with the disservices that don't respect end user freedom.

685
0:49:35,420 --> 0:49:42,540
 You said it's impractical to record every IP address I've used and every website I've

686
0:49:42,540 --> 0:49:45,040
 accessed, but actually I don't think so.

687
0:49:45,040 --> 0:49:50,680
 We could make a browser extension that does that and automatically request to be forgotten.

688
0:49:50,680 --> 0:49:55,980
 Would that be a reasonable approach for dealing with the sort of company that we were just

689
0:49:55,980 --> 0:49:56,980
 discussing?

690
0:49:56,980 --> 0:50:05,100
 Yeah, I didn't think anyone would say that, but I'm glad you say it, because if someone

691
0:50:05,100 --> 0:50:13,420
 can establish what they are doing as a person and giving and not giving consent to, and

692
0:50:13,420 --> 0:50:19,480
 then use that to inquire into their data in a very precise manner and finding out that

693
0:50:19,480 --> 0:50:25,460
 things are happening or not happening as they should be, then we have a case that can be

694
0:50:25,460 --> 0:50:27,240
 a legal case, right?

695
0:50:27,240 --> 0:50:30,380
 Then we can escalate from there.

696
0:50:30,380 --> 0:50:33,060
 But I mean...

697
0:50:33,060 --> 0:50:34,300
 With all those pages in a typical browser...

698
0:50:34,300 --> 0:50:34,500
 Yeah.

699
0:50:34,500 --> 0:50:34,600
 Yeah.

700
0:50:34,600 --> 0:50:34,700
 Yeah.

701
0:50:34,700 --> 0:50:34,800
 Yeah.

702
0:50:34,800 --> 0:50:34,900
 Yeah.

703
0:50:34,900 --> 0:50:35,000
 Yeah.

704
0:50:35,000 --> 0:50:35,060
 Yeah.

705
0:50:35,060 --> 0:50:35,080
 Yeah.

706
0:50:35,100 --> 0:50:42,500
 With all these political consent cookie bannas, I should say, sorry, it seems like there's

707
0:50:42,500 --> 0:50:49,700
 a very lot of legal details going on, so it would be a big thing if we get that, but if

708
0:50:49,700 --> 0:50:55,240
 we make the first step and we can see that there is something more, then I think it's

709
0:50:55,240 --> 0:50:58,640
 worth doing, especially with the do not track header.

710
0:50:58,640 --> 0:51:03,920
 Maybe that's also a simple way to establish, I'm using a do not track header, why are you

711
0:51:03,920 --> 0:51:04,900
 not respecting it?

712
0:51:04,900 --> 0:51:06,740
 Should you legally respect that?

713
0:51:11,460 --> 0:51:17,960
 I'm interested in why you connect government building blocks to consent.

714
0:51:19,160 --> 0:51:25,300
 Because from my understanding, most of what we do in government don't really need any consent.

715
0:51:26,140 --> 0:51:30,000
 So is government here actually the holder of the consents?

716
0:51:30,400 --> 0:51:33,000
 Or why is government involved?

717
0:51:33,000 --> 0:51:44,540
 So I didn't include anything on the GovStack project because I was afraid that would take up a lot of time to explain.

718
0:51:45,800 --> 0:51:52,760
 But GovStack is essentially not a government-owned project,

719
0:51:52,760 --> 0:52:02,180
 but it does have governments in it that the German foreign aid ministry is in it, Estonian government is in it.

720
0:52:03,000 --> 0:52:10,580
 The ITU, the International Telecoms Union is in it, and the Digital Impact Alliance is in it.

721
0:52:10,580 --> 0:52:22,660
 So these organizations, they wanted from the beginning to be able to supply that functionality

722
0:52:22,660 --> 0:52:28,260
 from an understanding that it is the right thing to do.

723
0:52:29,240 --> 0:52:31,520
 But there's many places where you don't need it.

724
0:52:31,600 --> 0:52:32,580
 You could just, like...

725
0:52:33,000 --> 0:52:37,640
 You could not have this so-called building block in your set of building blocks

726
0:52:37,640 --> 0:52:42,680
 because the legal situation would say you can do whatever you want because you're a government.

727
0:52:43,480 --> 0:52:47,680
 But I think when the tool is available, at least even though the government doesn't have to,

728
0:52:47,780 --> 0:52:48,340
 then they could.

729
0:52:50,400 --> 0:52:55,980
 And what we found also when we were building this specification

730
0:52:55,980 --> 0:53:01,180
 was that there aren't any tools that satisfy our specification.

731
0:53:01,600 --> 0:53:02,780
 So I think that was...

732
0:53:03,000 --> 0:53:08,380
 It was an important discovery in itself, was to work with this, set up the specification,

733
0:53:08,600 --> 0:53:14,240
 and then discover, hey, we actually need open source tools.

734
0:53:14,580 --> 0:53:16,680
 And GovStack is based on open source.

735
0:53:16,780 --> 0:53:21,520
 That makes it also interesting, digital common goods in this context.

736
0:53:22,160 --> 0:53:28,460
 And we need a digital common good that can satisfy this consent specification.

737
0:53:28,900 --> 0:53:28,980
 Yeah.

738
0:53:31,600 --> 0:53:32,260
 Thank you.

739
0:53:33,000 --> 0:53:36,680
 Sorry, I wasn't for the whole talk.

740
0:53:36,820 --> 0:53:41,760
 So I apologize in advance if I'm asking something that you already brought to the topic.

741
0:53:41,760 --> 0:53:44,680
 But I have two questions.

742
0:53:45,200 --> 0:53:46,220
 Actually, the first one.

743
0:53:47,480 --> 0:53:53,180
 So talking about legal, have you made some approach to some kind of organization?

744
0:53:54,100 --> 0:53:58,820
 Like, I mean, we have an organization called Legal Tech Lab.

745
0:53:59,360 --> 0:54:01,900
 So legal tech is kind of a buzzword for now.

746
0:54:03,000 --> 0:54:08,640
 Is there something happening in that, and that you can make a case regarding, like,

747
0:54:08,720 --> 0:54:18,420
 hey, I'm not giving consent, or this consent was not acquired in a legal attaining context.

748
0:54:18,680 --> 0:54:19,720
 So this is not valid.

749
0:54:19,800 --> 0:54:22,620
 Therefore, you're not permitted to keep my data.

750
0:54:23,140 --> 0:54:25,240
 So that's the first question that I have.

751
0:54:27,280 --> 0:54:31,240
 It's unfortunate that I don't...

752
0:54:31,920 --> 0:54:32,240
 Personally...

753
0:54:33,000 --> 0:54:37,760
 Go out and do the work of seeing what's going on in that department.

754
0:54:37,940 --> 0:54:39,080
 But it's a very...

755
0:54:39,080 --> 0:54:47,880
 It seems like in the room there is actually a little spark of energy to also go that direction.

756
0:54:47,880 --> 0:54:56,020
 So we could say, like, we are building a tool that can actually do the things we want in relation to consent.

757
0:54:56,160 --> 0:55:01,240
 But then we also want to expose, like, these practices of fake consent.

758
0:55:03,000 --> 0:55:05,940
 Or, like, not respecting the consent.

759
0:55:07,020 --> 0:55:13,620
 So I would encourage myself and everyone to look for that.

760
0:55:13,800 --> 0:55:15,760
 Because it could be something, yeah.

761
0:55:16,620 --> 0:55:21,200
 And, yeah, the second question that I had is, like, also considering, like,

762
0:55:21,340 --> 0:55:24,480
 reaching to the parliament for having something to pass by.

763
0:55:25,100 --> 0:55:32,260
 That will require, for instance, taking a look at vulnerable groups.

764
0:55:32,260 --> 0:55:32,860
 Like, like...

765
0:55:32,860 --> 0:55:35,460
 Let's say, Germany is not my first language.

766
0:55:35,920 --> 0:55:40,760
 So I will just be giving consent in order to get into a website to search for an apartment.

767
0:55:42,140 --> 0:55:44,620
 So things of that nature.

768
0:55:45,440 --> 0:55:49,520
 Saying, like, okay, if you are requesting consent from this person,

769
0:55:49,640 --> 0:55:55,260
 at least have the decency to put the information on the language that they can understand.

770
0:55:55,760 --> 0:55:59,440
 Or for sites that are just providing that in a certain language.

771
0:55:59,440 --> 0:56:02,440
 Or also looking at...

772
0:56:02,860 --> 0:56:05,960
 I mean, it's not necessarily people that, for them, would be like,

773
0:56:05,960 --> 0:56:07,360
 yeah, I mean, I don't know.

774
0:56:07,360 --> 0:56:09,740
 I just want to see pictures of my nieces.

775
0:56:09,740 --> 0:56:11,280
 Just get me in there.

776
0:56:11,280 --> 0:56:13,100
 I will consent to anything.

777
0:56:13,100 --> 0:56:16,620
 So it feels like kind of taking advantage.

778
0:56:16,620 --> 0:56:22,620
 So I was just asking if this is also something that can be considered.

779
0:56:22,900 --> 0:56:23,500
 Yeah.

780
0:56:23,500 --> 0:56:30,440
 It definitely makes me want to say again, like, the informed part of consent,

781
0:56:30,440 --> 0:56:32,440
 it should be part of the definition.

782
0:56:32,440 --> 0:56:35,680
 If there is no informed consent, then it's not really consent.

783
0:56:35,800 --> 0:56:36,400
 What is it, then?

784
0:56:36,520 --> 0:56:36,980
 I don't know.

785
0:56:37,880 --> 0:56:42,940
 The second part was that I forgot to mention accessibility and UX requirements.

786
0:56:43,420 --> 0:56:50,260
 So, of course, UX has to be catering for the user's needs.

787
0:56:51,300 --> 0:56:52,620
 Yeah, super basic stuff.

788
0:56:53,220 --> 0:56:54,640
 I should have added that.

789
0:56:55,540 --> 0:56:56,080
 Thank you.

790
0:56:56,080 --> 0:56:56,120
 Thank you.

791
0:57:00,560 --> 0:57:02,180
 In my experience,

792
0:57:02,180 --> 0:57:09,240
 users, or everyday users, they find it very hard to make that risk assessment of what

793
0:57:09,240 --> 0:57:14,140
 is the consequence of me giving, except that you can use my data.

794
0:57:14,140 --> 0:57:18,900
 So how will this tool help people do that risk assessment?

795
0:57:18,900 --> 0:57:24,040
 I know for the site, okay, I can see if I make a consent, I can do this, I cannot do

796
0:57:24,040 --> 0:57:25,040
 that.

797
0:57:25,040 --> 0:57:26,040
 I understand that.

798
0:57:26,040 --> 0:57:29,120
 But in the broader picture, how will it help that assessment?

799
0:57:29,120 --> 0:57:31,020
 I think it's really important.

800
0:57:31,020 --> 0:57:32,020
 Yeah.

801
0:57:32,020 --> 0:57:39,780
 I think that knowing that you can always go back and revoke your consent, and from

802
0:57:39,780 --> 0:57:47,920
 the beginning, knowing how to do that is super critical because, yes, we cannot guarantee

803
0:57:47,920 --> 0:57:52,440
 that the user actually reads what they accept.

804
0:57:52,440 --> 0:57:54,580
 There's no guarantee of that.

805
0:57:54,580 --> 0:57:58,780
 They scroll through the window in two seconds, or five seconds, or 20 seconds.

806
0:57:58,780 --> 0:58:00,140
 When have they read it?

807
0:58:00,140 --> 0:58:01,140
 It's...

808
0:58:01,140 --> 0:58:01,880
 It's...

809
0:58:01,880 --> 0:58:08,020
 These types of functionality doesn't work, but maybe establishing a convention about

810
0:58:08,020 --> 0:58:15,960
 consent, so that if you have a user interface, then kind of the same way that we are switching

811
0:58:15,960 --> 0:58:23,340
 between light, dark mode themes, or switching languages, we also know that this icon means

812
0:58:23,340 --> 0:58:24,340
 consent.

813
0:58:24,340 --> 0:58:26,000
 I don't even know if...

814
0:58:26,000 --> 0:58:29,840
 Maybe someone uses the checkbox to say it's about consent, but yeah.

815
0:58:29,840 --> 0:58:30,840
 Like a...

816
0:58:30,840 --> 0:58:36,800
 Well-established convention for consent will mean that people can change it, and then

817
0:58:36,800 --> 0:58:40,940
 have a system that understands that consent can always change at any time.

818
0:58:40,940 --> 0:58:41,940
 That's...

819
0:58:41,940 --> 0:58:42,940
 Awesome.

820
0:58:42,940 --> 0:58:45,480
 We are at the hour.

821
0:58:45,480 --> 0:58:47,480
 Let's give a round of applause for Benjamin.

822
0:58:47,480 --> 0:58:48,480
 Yeah.

823
0:58:48,480 --> 0:58:49,480
 Thank you for listening.
