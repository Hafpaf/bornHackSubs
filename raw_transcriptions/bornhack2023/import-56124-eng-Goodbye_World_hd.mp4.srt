0:00:00,000 --> 0:00:21,600
 Let's give a big hand to the last speaker we have this year, Tick with Goodbye World.

2
0:00:21,600 --> 0:00:23,540
 Thank you everybody.

3
0:00:23,540 --> 0:00:28,880
 We are nearing the end of what has been an amazing BornHack 2023.

4
0:00:28,880 --> 0:00:32,920
 It is always a bit weird.

5
0:00:32,920 --> 0:00:38,820
 The week goes by incredibly fast, it feels like, and so much has happened that it can

6
0:00:38,820 --> 0:00:42,100
 be difficult to get your head around it.

7
0:00:42,100 --> 0:00:45,760
 We had some weather over the last couple of days.

8
0:00:45,760 --> 0:00:50,560
 We have reduced the number of pavilions significantly on the site.

9
0:00:50,560 --> 0:00:57,300
 I guess we considered starting teardown early, an unplanned teardown.

10
0:00:57,300 --> 0:01:03,040
 Most of the important things are still standing, and we hope that the worst of the weather has

11
0:01:03,040 --> 0:01:09,340
 passed, especially right after this, where we hope to take down the big tent.

12
0:01:09,340 --> 0:01:12,140
 Please stay dry.

13
0:01:12,140 --> 0:01:17,920
 I have a lot of fun stats about the week that went by, and some practical info.

14
0:01:17,920 --> 0:01:22,720
 I want to start out by talking a little bit about Grafen.

15
0:01:22,720 --> 0:01:27,140
 As you remember from Hello World, and as most of you know, we lost an organizer this year,

16
0:01:27,140 --> 0:01:33,020
 last year, but between the last BornHack and this BornHack.

17
0:01:33,020 --> 0:01:39,380
 We have been struggling to figure out a good way to remember him, and we've decided to

18
0:01:39,380 --> 0:01:42,200
 plant a tree here at Hylgedam.

19
0:01:42,200 --> 0:01:49,380
 It will be placed out here by the radio tower, and it is being delivered the day after tomorrow,

20
0:01:49,380 --> 0:01:50,380
 probably.

21
0:01:50,380 --> 0:01:56,000
 There's some logistics involved when you're getting a sizable tree delivered, but we hope

22
0:01:56,000 --> 0:01:57,000
 it will be here.

23
0:01:57,000 --> 0:02:00,220
 It will be delivered later than Thursday.

24
0:02:00,220 --> 0:02:06,820
 We have put up a mailbox in the bar where everybody is encouraged to write a letter

25
0:02:06,820 --> 0:02:12,300
 to Grafen, and all the letters will be buried under the tree, put in the hole before we

26
0:02:12,300 --> 0:02:18,680
 put in the tree when we put it in on Thursday or whenever it's going to be.

27
0:02:18,680 --> 0:02:24,220
 The mailbox is in the bar, and we hope you will take time to write down some thoughts.

28
0:02:24,220 --> 0:02:25,880
 Nobody will ever read it.

29
0:02:25,880 --> 0:02:26,880
 So.

30
0:02:26,880 --> 0:02:30,100
 It's more for you than for anyone else.

31
0:02:30,100 --> 0:02:48,700
 The tree is a silver linden.

32
0:02:48,700 --> 0:02:54,100
 I don't know much about trees, but it's pretty, and we hope it will be here for many years.

33
0:02:54,100 --> 0:02:55,100
 Thank you.

34
0:02:55,100 --> 0:02:56,100
 Thank you.

35
0:02:56,100 --> 0:02:59,320
 Thank you.

36
0:02:59,320 --> 0:03:00,320
 Okay.

37
0:03:00,320 --> 0:03:05,320
 Let's get on to the more fun stuff.

38
0:03:05,320 --> 0:03:11,920
 Statistics.

39
0:03:11,920 --> 0:03:13,980
 We all love that, right?

40
0:03:13,980 --> 0:03:16,220
 The program grew significantly this year.

41
0:03:16,220 --> 0:03:24,320
 There was a few fewer talks, but overall it was a more full program than it has ever been

42
0:03:24,320 --> 0:03:25,320
 before.

43
0:03:25,320 --> 0:03:26,320
 I want to give a big thank you to everybody who submitted.

44
0:03:26,320 --> 0:03:33,380
 We had 23 of the regular talks, which is fewer than last year, 11 lightning talks, which

45
0:03:33,380 --> 0:03:39,020
 is quite a bit more than last year, 18 workshops, which is a lot, and some of them were way

46
0:03:39,020 --> 0:03:42,640
 overcrowded, so there could probably have been more.

47
0:03:42,640 --> 0:03:48,380
 We had the panel debate, which was, again, a great success, and 12 meetups this year,

48
0:03:48,380 --> 0:03:53,440
 which is double what we had last year, a couple of music acts, and 19 recreational events.

49
0:03:53,440 --> 0:03:54,440
 Thank you.

50
0:03:54,440 --> 0:03:54,640
 Thank you.

51
0:03:54,640 --> 0:03:55,640
 Thank you.

52
0:03:55,640 --> 0:03:57,940
 I just had to talk about some of the events, various things submitted by villages and everything.

53
0:03:57,940 --> 0:04:01,360
 It's been so good to see all the activities going on.

54
0:04:01,360 --> 0:04:06,560
 The content team has been working hard putting this together, and all the people who've submitted,

55
0:04:06,560 --> 0:04:07,560
 thank you all.

56
0:04:07,560 --> 0:04:17,940
 Let's give everybody involved a big round of applause.

57
0:04:17,940 --> 0:04:23,060
 Of course, let's not forget the video team, who are tirelessly working to stream locally

58
0:04:23,060 --> 0:04:24,060
 and stream online.

59
0:04:24,060 --> 0:04:24,480
 All this is doing a great job.

60
0:04:24,640 --> 0:04:30,460
 Also everything is being recorded so we can go, let's give it a month, we have to recover

61
0:04:30,460 --> 0:04:36,360
 a bit but pretty soon you'll be able to see it on media.ccc.de once we've done the post

62
0:04:36,360 --> 0:04:38,460
 processing and stuff.

63
0:04:38,460 --> 0:04:52,100
 And the video team has been handling all that like pros so thank you for that.

64
0:04:52,100 --> 0:04:57,920
 The NOC team has as always delivered an impressive infrastructure out here in the middle of nowhere.

65
0:04:57,920 --> 0:05:03,940
 We had very fast uplink speeds, I think I saw a speed test from a tent of eight and

66
0:05:03,940 --> 0:05:11,400
 a half gigabits or something, and that's to the outside world, 35 access points were put

67
0:05:11,400 --> 0:05:20,580
 up by NOC for the Wi-Fi, 300 almost, 350 unique connected devices, oh no, max, simultaneous

68
0:05:20,580 --> 0:05:21,580
 I think it means.

69
0:05:21,580 --> 0:05:22,080
 So that's it.

70
0:05:22,100 --> 0:05:30,660
 Quite some data was pulled through our connection, 42 terabytes uploaded and 6 terabytes downloaded

71
0:05:30,660 --> 0:05:36,820
 and of the 42 terabytes, a single tent and a single user is responsible for 90% of it,

72
0:05:36,820 --> 0:05:45,140
 so well done.

73
0:05:45,140 --> 0:05:51,580
 I happen to know it is data going to a really good course so it is very good to see.

74
0:05:51,580 --> 0:05:58,340
 Bar numbers, as you know we depend on the bar to stay above water financially and you

75
0:05:58,340 --> 0:06:01,580
 have been very good at using the bar, we really appreciate it.

76
0:06:01,580 --> 0:06:09,280
 There's some impressive stats from down there, they sold 3700 things, over 2600 transactions,

77
0:06:09,280 --> 0:06:14,620
 628 cocktails, I may be responsible for quite a few of those.

78
0:06:14,620 --> 0:06:20,660
 619 liters of beer, I am absolutely responsible for zero of those.

79
0:06:20,660 --> 0:06:21,160
 Okay.

80
0:06:21,580 --> 0:06:29,780
 445 liters of mate, same, 17 tsunamis, I may also be involved there and we had this

81
0:06:29,780 --> 0:06:34,740
 year four free kegs bought by participants in the bar and put up for free for everybody

82
0:06:34,740 --> 0:06:41,840
 to drink, three of them were weddings and the last one was 40 around birthday.

83
0:06:41,840 --> 0:06:50,060
 The bar has been open almost like I've been awake, there hasn't been many times where

84
0:06:50,060 --> 0:06:51,060
 I've walked by the bar.

85
0:06:51,060 --> 0:06:56,700
 And it's been closed and it's down to an amazing bar team both constructing it and keeping

86
0:06:56,700 --> 0:07:01,940
 it alive and involving over the week and also tending, cleaning up and doing everything

87
0:07:01,940 --> 0:07:04,740
 that's needed to keep our bar running.

88
0:07:04,740 --> 0:07:17,620
 Let's give them a big round of applause.

89
0:07:17,620 --> 0:07:19,520
 So the game team once again.

90
0:07:19,520 --> 0:07:19,980
 Organised.

91
0:07:19,980 --> 0:07:20,260
 Organised.

92
0:07:20,260 --> 0:07:20,680
 Amazing.

93
0:07:20,680 --> 0:07:22,540
 token game. It's

94
0:07:22,540 --> 0:07:24,620
 sort of a treasure hunt for little text strings

95
0:07:24,620 --> 0:07:26,600
 all over the venue. They are offline

96
0:07:26,600 --> 0:07:28,600
 and online and all over

97
0:07:28,600 --> 0:07:30,820
 the place. 60 people

98
0:07:30,820 --> 0:07:32,380
 took place in the

99
0:07:32,380 --> 0:07:34,340
 contest and

100
0:07:34,340 --> 0:07:36,380
 27 tokens were found

101
0:07:36,380 --> 0:07:38,240
 and 242 times

102
0:07:38,240 --> 0:07:40,660
 a token was found. Game team,

103
0:07:40,740 --> 0:07:41,780
 do we have a winner to announce?

104
0:07:42,540 --> 0:07:44,540
 They have been announced. Oh, I didn't see.

105
0:07:44,620 --> 0:07:46,380
 Sorry. The winner has been announced

106
0:07:46,380 --> 0:07:48,520
 and I hope they are happy they got a free ticket

107
0:07:48,520 --> 0:07:49,720
 for next year's event.

108
0:07:51,500 --> 0:07:52,580
 Let's give a

109
0:07:52,580 --> 0:07:53,940
 big round of applause to the game team.

110
0:08:02,080 --> 0:08:04,200
 Between the token game and

111
0:08:04,200 --> 0:08:06,400
 the Jeopardy and everything,

112
0:08:06,560 --> 0:08:08,280
 they are really doing a lot of work

113
0:08:08,280 --> 0:08:10,200
 that used to fall on Orga,

114
0:08:10,380 --> 0:08:12,480
 so we are very, very happy with

115
0:08:12,480 --> 0:08:13,920
 that and it's working so well, so

116
0:08:13,920 --> 0:08:14,980
 thank you.

117
0:08:16,920 --> 0:08:18,520
 The shuttle team has

118
0:08:18,520 --> 0:08:20,380
 also been busy this year. They almost

119
0:08:20,380 --> 0:08:22,460
 got out of it. We almost didn't get a shuttle car

120
0:08:22,460 --> 0:08:24,440
 but we managed to get one

121
0:08:24,440 --> 0:08:26,400
 last minute thanks to Dennis

122
0:08:26,400 --> 0:08:27,300
 who helped find a sponsor.

123
0:08:28,520 --> 0:08:30,400
 The shuttle team does the drives

124
0:08:30,400 --> 0:08:32,380
 back and forth to the station mostly and

125
0:08:32,380 --> 0:08:34,000
 to the supermarket occasionally.

126
0:08:36,020 --> 0:08:36,460
 47

127
0:08:36,460 --> 0:08:37,480
 trips and

128
0:08:37,480 --> 0:08:40,420
 a lot of communication and coordination in

129
0:08:40,420 --> 0:08:42,580
 the mailbox and a few

130
0:08:42,580 --> 0:08:44,320
 jumping runs. They are still

131
0:08:44,320 --> 0:08:46,220
 doing shuttle runs, so

132
0:08:46,220 --> 0:08:48,300
 when you need to leave tomorrow or

133
0:08:48,300 --> 0:08:50,200
 whenever you need to leave, you can

134
0:08:50,200 --> 0:08:52,220
 write an email to the shuttle team

135
0:08:52,220 --> 0:08:54,000
 and hopefully they can take you.

136
0:08:55,600 --> 0:08:56,440
 I don't even

137
0:08:56,440 --> 0:08:58,200
 see, I hope Floma is here

138
0:08:58,200 --> 0:09:00,400
 and some of the

139
0:09:00,400 --> 0:09:01,760
 other shuttle team people because

140
0:09:01,760 --> 0:09:04,300
 they really provide a service that, for

141
0:09:04,300 --> 0:09:06,460
 participants at least, makes it so much easier

142
0:09:06,460 --> 0:09:08,260
 to get to and from the event, so thank you

143
0:09:08,260 --> 0:09:08,620
 to them.

144
0:09:18,420 --> 0:09:20,140
 The power team has again,

145
0:09:20,200 --> 0:09:22,380
 rolled out an impressive amount of copper on

146
0:09:22,380 --> 0:09:24,040
 the venue so we could all get

147
0:09:24,040 --> 0:09:26,380
 something resembling 230

148
0:09:26,380 --> 0:09:26,840
 volts.

149
0:09:29,140 --> 0:09:30,520
 It is tricky

150
0:09:30,520 --> 0:09:31,580
 with the

151
0:09:31,580 --> 0:09:34,440
 resources we have

152
0:09:34,440 --> 0:09:36,440
 available and the way the power is wired

153
0:09:36,440 --> 0:09:38,340
 on the venue. It is very difficult to

154
0:09:38,340 --> 0:09:40,300
 provide stable power

155
0:09:40,300 --> 0:09:41,920
 at the voltages we would like to but

156
0:09:41,920 --> 0:09:44,220
 they are again and again

157
0:09:44,220 --> 0:09:46,440
 proving that it can be done with

158
0:09:46,440 --> 0:09:47,660
 a few

159
0:09:47,660 --> 0:09:49,920
 low voltages.

160
0:09:50,200 --> 0:09:52,200
 It is very hard to avoid completely

161
0:09:52,200 --> 0:09:54,200
 because with the weather we have been having

162
0:09:54,200 --> 0:09:56,200
 it is tricky keeping water out of everything.

163
0:09:56,200 --> 0:09:58,200
 And when you do take down your village,

164
0:09:58,200 --> 0:10:00,200
 please unplug stuff before you start touching

165
0:10:00,200 --> 0:10:02,200
 the roof and stuff so we don't get any

166
0:10:02,200 --> 0:10:04,200
 outages during teardown.

167
0:10:04,200 --> 0:10:06,200
 The power team has been very quick to respond

168
0:10:06,200 --> 0:10:08,200
 when there has been outages.

169
0:10:08,200 --> 0:10:10,200
 They go from the distribution point

170
0:10:10,200 --> 0:10:12,200
 to the

171
0:10:12,200 --> 0:10:14,200
 distribution point.

172
0:10:14,200 --> 0:10:16,200
 The power team has been very quick to respond

173
0:10:16,200 --> 0:10:18,200
 when there has been outages.

174
0:10:18,200 --> 0:10:20,200
 They go from the distribution point to the

175
0:10:20,200 --> 0:10:22,200
 distribution point and try to turn it off

176
0:10:22,200 --> 0:10:24,200
 and isolate and eventually find the culprit

177
0:10:24,200 --> 0:10:26,200
 and get it fixed and everybody

178
0:10:26,200 --> 0:10:28,200
 has power again. It is usually a quick process.

179
0:10:28,200 --> 0:10:30,200
 Thank you so much to the power

180
0:10:30,200 --> 0:10:32,200
 team, Flemming and the others.

181
0:10:42,200 --> 0:10:44,200
 As you know

182
0:10:44,200 --> 0:10:46,200
 we are, as you may know,

183
0:10:46,200 --> 0:10:48,200
 we are about 10 people or 11 people

184
0:10:48,200 --> 0:10:50,200
 in the ORGA group and it takes

185
0:10:50,200 --> 0:10:52,200
 maybe 50 people to run this event

186
0:10:52,200 --> 0:10:54,200
 or more. We would

187
0:10:54,200 --> 0:10:56,200
 be unable to

188
0:10:56,200 --> 0:10:58,200
 even begin considering doing this

189
0:10:58,200 --> 0:11:00,200
 if we didn't get all the help

190
0:11:00,200 --> 0:11:02,200
 from all the volunteers. Especially this

191
0:11:02,200 --> 0:11:04,200
 year it has been a joy.

192
0:11:04,200 --> 0:11:06,200
 There has been volunteer meetings every day

193
0:11:06,200 --> 0:11:08,200
 at 14 in the

194
0:11:08,200 --> 0:11:10,200
 what used to be the start end across from

195
0:11:10,200 --> 0:11:12,200
 the info desk until it disappeared.

196
0:11:12,200 --> 0:11:14,200
 And people have

197
0:11:14,200 --> 0:11:16,200
 been willing and

198
0:11:16,200 --> 0:11:18,200
 have been helping out even

199
0:11:18,200 --> 0:11:20,200
 on their own, discovering things

200
0:11:20,200 --> 0:11:22,200
 and just putting a message in the signal group

201
0:11:22,200 --> 0:11:24,200
 this was off, I fixed it, you don't need to

202
0:11:24,200 --> 0:11:26,200
 worry about it. It is such a

203
0:11:26,200 --> 0:11:28,200
 huge load off of

204
0:11:28,200 --> 0:11:30,200
 ORGA specs which means that

205
0:11:30,200 --> 0:11:32,200
 we've had excess cycles

206
0:11:32,200 --> 0:11:34,200
 to do other stuff that would usually

207
0:11:34,200 --> 0:11:36,200
 pile up towards the end of the event.

208
0:11:36,200 --> 0:11:38,200
 Stuff like economy

209
0:11:38,200 --> 0:11:40,200
 stuff that's usually

210
0:11:40,200 --> 0:11:42,200
 lying because that can be

211
0:11:42,200 --> 0:11:44,200
 pushed forward.

212
0:11:44,200 --> 0:11:46,200
 It means a lot to us because

213
0:11:46,200 --> 0:11:48,200
 when we get home we, like everybody else,

214
0:11:48,200 --> 0:11:50,200
 need to wind down and

215
0:11:50,200 --> 0:11:52,200
 that's difficult when you know you have a pile of work

216
0:11:52,200 --> 0:11:54,200
 waiting for you. And a lot of that

217
0:11:54,200 --> 0:11:56,200
 has already been done from day to day

218
0:11:56,200 --> 0:11:58,200
 and that's all thanks to all the volunteers.

219
0:11:58,200 --> 0:12:00,200
 Can everybody who helped out please stand up

220
0:12:00,200 --> 0:12:02,200
 and be applauded.

221
0:12:20,200 --> 0:12:22,200
 Thank you.

222
0:12:22,200 --> 0:12:24,200
 We are

223
0:12:24,200 --> 0:12:26,200
 preparing tear down

224
0:12:26,200 --> 0:12:28,200
 at

225
0:12:28,200 --> 0:12:30,200
 right after this talk we'll take down

226
0:12:30,200 --> 0:12:32,200
 this tent. I'll talk more about that

227
0:12:32,200 --> 0:12:34,200
 after. But tomorrow

228
0:12:34,200 --> 0:12:36,200
 at noon the event is officially over

229
0:12:36,200 --> 0:12:38,200
 and then we'll start taking down power and

230
0:12:38,200 --> 0:12:40,200
 network and all the infrastructure

231
0:12:40,200 --> 0:12:42,200
 until noon tomorrow

232
0:12:42,200 --> 0:12:44,200
 there will be full power and network

233
0:12:44,200 --> 0:12:46,200
 and everything. The only thing we are taking down

234
0:12:46,200 --> 0:12:48,200
 is this tent. But

235
0:12:48,200 --> 0:12:50,200
 we do need help with tear down

236
0:12:50,200 --> 0:12:52,200
 so if you have one or two

237
0:12:52,200 --> 0:12:54,200
 extra days and you can stick around and help us

238
0:12:54,200 --> 0:12:56,200
 sort, carry,

239
0:12:56,200 --> 0:12:58,200
 stack stuff, return

240
0:12:58,200 --> 0:13:00,200
 it, get it ready to return to

241
0:13:00,200 --> 0:13:02,200
 all the suppliers who are showing up

242
0:13:02,200 --> 0:13:04,200
 Thursday or Friday to do

243
0:13:04,200 --> 0:13:06,200
 pickups, then it

244
0:13:06,200 --> 0:13:08,200
 I mean the more the merrier. We can always

245
0:13:08,200 --> 0:13:10,200
 use more hands. Jonathan is cooking

246
0:13:10,200 --> 0:13:12,200
 from starting tomorrow evening

247
0:13:12,200 --> 0:13:14,200
 and it's always

248
0:13:14,200 --> 0:13:16,200
 yes.

249
0:13:20,200 --> 0:13:24,200
 And it is actually always

250
0:13:24,200 --> 0:13:26,200
 good fun even though it's of course

251
0:13:26,200 --> 0:13:28,200
 hard work and you have a full week

252
0:13:28,200 --> 0:13:30,200
 of event and maybe even build up

253
0:13:30,200 --> 0:13:32,200
 in your system already.

254
0:13:32,200 --> 0:13:34,200
 The more the merrier.

255
0:13:34,200 --> 0:13:36,200
 Not all of it is hard work and hopefully

256
0:13:36,200 --> 0:13:38,200
 the weather will treat us

257
0:13:38,200 --> 0:13:40,200
 nicely and

258
0:13:40,200 --> 0:13:42,200
 yeah, maybe some

259
0:13:42,200 --> 0:13:44,200
 bar leftovers. It's usually

260
0:13:44,200 --> 0:13:46,200
 a good time. Fires every

261
0:13:46,200 --> 0:13:48,200
 evening and everything you

262
0:13:48,200 --> 0:13:50,200
 can want. All

263
0:13:50,200 --> 0:13:52,200
 the work you could ask for.

264
0:13:52,200 --> 0:13:54,200
 Yeah.

265
0:13:54,200 --> 0:13:56,200
 Even a little helps. Even a half a day

266
0:13:56,200 --> 0:13:58,200
 or something. So please consider

267
0:13:58,200 --> 0:14:00,200
 staying for tear down.

268
0:14:02,200 --> 0:14:04,200
 We had the first coordination

269
0:14:04,200 --> 0:14:06,200
 meeting at 1600

270
0:14:06,200 --> 0:14:08,200
 in the bar start tent where we also had

271
0:14:08,200 --> 0:14:10,200
 the volunteer meetings during

272
0:14:12,200 --> 0:14:14,200
 during build up. The tent is disassembling

273
0:14:14,200 --> 0:14:16,200
 itself as we speak. It knows

274
0:14:16,200 --> 0:14:18,200
 what's about to happen.

275
0:14:18,200 --> 0:14:20,200
 So at

276
0:14:20,200 --> 0:14:22,200
 16 tomorrow in the

277
0:14:22,200 --> 0:14:24,200
 start tent by the bar we will have the first

278
0:14:24,200 --> 0:14:26,200
 coordination meeting and at 19 we will

279
0:14:26,200 --> 0:14:28,200
 have the first official tear down meal

280
0:14:28,200 --> 0:14:30,200
 and those of you who have tried it before know

281
0:14:30,200 --> 0:14:32,200
 after each meal there will

282
0:14:32,200 --> 0:14:34,200
 be 9, 13 and 19

283
0:14:34,200 --> 0:14:36,200
 we have a coordination meeting

284
0:14:36,200 --> 0:14:38,200
 and hand out the tasks.

285
0:14:38,200 --> 0:14:40,200
 We have the venue until

286
0:14:40,200 --> 0:14:42,200
 Saturday officially. We are aiming

287
0:14:42,200 --> 0:14:44,200
 for most things to be fixed by

288
0:14:44,200 --> 0:14:46,200
 Friday.

289
0:14:46,200 --> 0:14:48,200
 Barring any

290
0:14:48,200 --> 0:14:50,200
 violent weather or something can

291
0:14:50,200 --> 0:14:52,200
 easily delay things but

292
0:14:52,200 --> 0:14:54,200
 we think we should be

293
0:14:54,200 --> 0:14:56,200
 ready around Friday, Saturday.

294
0:15:00,200 --> 0:15:02,200
 We would like to know what you thought

295
0:15:02,200 --> 0:15:04,200
 of the event. Sometimes

296
0:15:04,200 --> 0:15:06,200
 it's easier to sit down and gather

297
0:15:06,200 --> 0:15:08,200
 your thoughts and put it in writing so

298
0:15:08,200 --> 0:15:10,200
 we have the, and it's easier for us

299
0:15:10,200 --> 0:15:12,200
 to remember.

300
0:15:12,200 --> 0:15:14,200
 Bornhack.dk feedback

301
0:15:14,200 --> 0:15:16,200
 please post positive and negative feedback

302
0:15:16,200 --> 0:15:18,200
 is greatly appreciated

303
0:15:18,200 --> 0:15:20,200
 and there's also an option

304
0:15:20,200 --> 0:15:22,200
 on the individual events in the program

305
0:15:22,200 --> 0:15:24,200
 to give feedback to the speaker

306
0:15:24,200 --> 0:15:26,200
 about the event and

307
0:15:26,200 --> 0:15:28,200
 that is also appreciated by the content team

308
0:15:28,200 --> 0:15:30,200
 because then they know what to get more of

309
0:15:30,200 --> 0:15:32,200
 next year so

310
0:15:32,200 --> 0:15:34,200
 the program can be even better.

311
0:15:38,200 --> 0:15:40,200
 If you lost anything or you found

312
0:15:40,200 --> 0:15:42,200
 something then please take it to the info desk

313
0:15:42,200 --> 0:15:44,200
 and we will try to get it untangled

314
0:15:44,200 --> 0:15:46,200
 and get the right stuff sent home with the right

315
0:15:46,200 --> 0:15:48,200
 people so nobody leaves anything

316
0:15:48,200 --> 0:15:50,200
 in funeral.

317
0:15:50,200 --> 0:15:52,200
 Our food vendor

318
0:15:52,200 --> 0:15:54,200
 will leave

319
0:15:54,200 --> 0:15:56,200
 tomorrow around 14

320
0:15:56,200 --> 0:15:58,200
 so there's time to get lunch tomorrow

321
0:15:58,200 --> 0:16:00,200
 and then there will be a

322
0:16:00,200 --> 0:16:02,200
 tear down meal in the

323
0:16:02,200 --> 0:16:04,200
 dinner in the cabin from 19

324
0:16:04,200 --> 0:16:06,200
 but you do need to

325
0:16:06,200 --> 0:16:08,200
 we're not serving

326
0:16:08,200 --> 0:16:10,200
 volunteer lunch tomorrow

327
0:16:10,200 --> 0:16:12,200
 so make sure you eat on your own

328
0:16:12,200 --> 0:16:14,200
 and then we will start taking

329
0:16:14,200 --> 0:16:16,200
 care of the meals starting tomorrow evening.

330
0:16:16,200 --> 0:16:18,200
 The food area

331
0:16:18,200 --> 0:16:20,200
 tent will stay up until

332
0:16:20,200 --> 0:16:22,200
 Thursday and we will start

333
0:16:22,200 --> 0:16:24,200
 taking it down there so there's also the option

334
0:16:24,200 --> 0:16:26,200
 of cooking for yourself over the next couple of days.

335
0:16:28,200 --> 0:16:30,200
 The food area team has been keeping

336
0:16:30,200 --> 0:16:32,200
 and we are talking about a

337
0:16:32,200 --> 0:16:34,200
 two man army or two person army

338
0:16:34,200 --> 0:16:36,200
 has been keeping the food area so

339
0:16:36,200 --> 0:16:38,200
 nice and tidy so let's give them a

340
0:16:38,200 --> 0:16:40,200
 big round of applause.

341
0:16:50,200 --> 0:16:52,200
 It's a fun story because

342
0:16:52,200 --> 0:16:54,200
 we didn't quite

343
0:16:54,200 --> 0:16:56,200
 understand what happened

344
0:16:56,200 --> 0:16:58,200
 suddenly the food area started being really

345
0:16:58,200 --> 0:17:00,200
 messy and dirty and we had to get cleaners

346
0:17:00,200 --> 0:17:02,200
 to fix it and everything and it turned out that

347
0:17:02,200 --> 0:17:04,200
 these two lovely people just missed a couple of

348
0:17:04,200 --> 0:17:06,200
 born hacks and wasn't doing all the cleaning

349
0:17:06,200 --> 0:17:08,200
 they were usually doing and suddenly

350
0:17:08,200 --> 0:17:10,200
 the absence of something

351
0:17:10,200 --> 0:17:12,200
 like that becomes very obvious when it's

352
0:17:12,200 --> 0:17:14,200
 not there so they have been doing this

353
0:17:14,200 --> 0:17:16,200
 we just maybe

354
0:17:16,200 --> 0:17:18,200
 forgot to notice or appreciate it

355
0:17:18,200 --> 0:17:20,200
 fantastic work thank you.

356
0:17:20,200 --> 0:17:28,200
 applause

357
0:17:28,200 --> 0:17:30,200
 okay we

358
0:17:30,200 --> 0:17:32,200
 have a tradition that goes back all

359
0:17:32,200 --> 0:17:34,200
 the way to the first born hack that

360
0:17:34,200 --> 0:17:36,200
 the speakers chair is built

361
0:17:36,200 --> 0:17:38,200
 carefully and lovingly and

362
0:17:38,200 --> 0:17:40,200
 artfully and then

363
0:17:40,200 --> 0:17:42,200
 when we are done with it we burn it

364
0:17:42,200 --> 0:17:44,200
 and it's kind of a weird tradition

365
0:17:44,200 --> 0:17:46,200
 but it is a tradition nonetheless

366
0:17:46,200 --> 0:17:48,200
 and

367
0:17:48,200 --> 0:17:50,200
 tomorrow evening whether permitting or

368
0:17:50,200 --> 0:17:52,200
 otherwise Thursday we are probably

369
0:17:52,200 --> 0:17:54,200
 having a fire anyway but

370
0:17:54,200 --> 0:17:56,200
 one of these days the

371
0:17:56,200 --> 0:17:58,200
 speakers chair is going

372
0:17:58,200 --> 0:18:00,200
 it's usually great fun

373
0:18:00,200 --> 0:18:02,200
 we can get rid of some hand sanitizer

374
0:18:02,200 --> 0:18:04,200
 while we are at it

375
0:18:04,200 --> 0:18:06,200
 laughter

376
0:18:10,200 --> 0:18:12,200
 so post camp

377
0:18:12,200 --> 0:18:14,200
 blues can be pretty rough

378
0:18:14,200 --> 0:18:16,200
 being surrounded by so many lovely

379
0:18:16,200 --> 0:18:18,200
 people and

380
0:18:18,200 --> 0:18:20,200
 enjoying the content and

381
0:18:20,200 --> 0:18:22,200
 the environment and the community

382
0:18:22,200 --> 0:18:24,200
 and the feeling of togetherness

383
0:18:24,200 --> 0:18:26,200
 and then returning to

384
0:18:26,200 --> 0:18:28,200
 a pretty bleak reality

385
0:18:28,200 --> 0:18:30,200
 on the outside of these walls can be

386
0:18:30,200 --> 0:18:32,200
 a little rough and

387
0:18:32,200 --> 0:18:34,200
 and that's I mean

388
0:18:34,200 --> 0:18:36,200
 there's nothing to do

389
0:18:36,200 --> 0:18:38,200
 you have to come down when you've

390
0:18:38,200 --> 0:18:40,200
 been up right but

391
0:18:40,200 --> 0:18:42,200
 there's some suggested remedies

392
0:18:42,200 --> 0:18:44,200
 for when you feel the sadness

393
0:18:44,200 --> 0:18:46,200
 watch some of the talks you missed

394
0:18:46,200 --> 0:18:48,200
 we are getting them up as soon as

395
0:18:48,200 --> 0:18:50,200
 we can you can play with your bass

396
0:18:50,200 --> 0:18:52,200
 or some of the previous years badges

397
0:18:52,200 --> 0:18:54,200
 you can organize all your pictures and

398
0:18:54,200 --> 0:18:56,200
 send the cool ones to us if they are

399
0:18:56,200 --> 0:18:58,200
 in a creative commons lies under

400
0:18:58,200 --> 0:19:00,200
 creative commons license so we can use

401
0:19:00,200 --> 0:19:02,200
 them we would greatly appreciate that

402
0:19:02,200 --> 0:19:04,200
 stay in touch online

403
0:19:04,200 --> 0:19:06,200
 we have the ISE channel we have the

404
0:19:06,200 --> 0:19:08,200
 signal groups talk to old and new

405
0:19:08,200 --> 0:19:10,200
 friends keep the community going

406
0:19:10,200 --> 0:19:12,200
 throughout the year

407
0:19:12,200 --> 0:19:14,200
 buy a ticket for born hack 2024

408
0:19:14,200 --> 0:19:16,200
 they will be for sale as soon as we've

409
0:19:16,200 --> 0:19:18,200
 recovered from this during the fall at

410
0:19:18,200 --> 0:19:20,200
 some point

411
0:19:20,200 --> 0:19:22,200
 and keep on hacking

412
0:19:22,200 --> 0:19:24,200
 applause

413
0:19:24,200 --> 0:19:26,200
 applause

414
0:19:26,200 --> 0:19:28,200
 applause

415
0:19:28,200 --> 0:19:30,200
 applause

416
0:19:30,200 --> 0:19:32,200
 applause

417
0:19:32,200 --> 0:19:34,200
 applause

418
0:19:34,200 --> 0:19:36,200
 born hack 2024 has moved forward slightly

419
0:19:36,200 --> 0:19:38,200
 it is scheduled

420
0:19:38,200 --> 0:19:40,200
 for the 17th to the 24th

421
0:19:40,200 --> 0:19:42,200
 of July 2024

422
0:19:42,200 --> 0:19:44,200
 it's a Wednesday to Wednesday

423
0:19:44,200 --> 0:19:46,200
 we realize moving it is going to be

424
0:19:46,200 --> 0:19:48,200
 inconvenient for some people

425
0:19:48,200 --> 0:19:50,200
 for other people it will be convenient

426
0:19:50,200 --> 0:19:52,200
 there's no way to

427
0:19:52,200 --> 0:19:54,200
 make everybody happy with this

428
0:19:54,200 --> 0:19:56,200
 the current dates in

429
0:19:56,200 --> 0:19:58,200
 like mid-August that we've been doing

430
0:19:58,200 --> 0:20:00,200
 for some years

431
0:20:00,200 --> 0:20:02,200
 conflict with the big German and Dutch

432
0:20:02,200 --> 0:20:04,200
 camps in a way that makes it really

433
0:20:04,200 --> 0:20:06,200
 difficult for us to get the venue because

434
0:20:06,200 --> 0:20:08,200
 this venue has to be booked about two

435
0:20:08,200 --> 0:20:10,200
 years in advance and when the big Dutch

436
0:20:10,200 --> 0:20:12,200
 and German events don't decide on their

437
0:20:12,200 --> 0:20:14,200
 dates until eight months before then we

438
0:20:14,200 --> 0:20:16,200
 have

439
0:20:16,200 --> 0:20:18,200
 as you can see an impossible job of

440
0:20:18,200 --> 0:20:20,200
 picking a date that doesn't fit the

441
0:20:20,200 --> 0:20:22,200
 conflict because we are the small

442
0:20:22,200 --> 0:20:24,200
 camp if we end up being

443
0:20:24,200 --> 0:20:26,200
 at the same time a CCC camp or the

444
0:20:26,200 --> 0:20:28,200
 Dutch events we will lose

445
0:20:28,200 --> 0:20:30,200
 even Orga would not show up because we

446
0:20:30,200 --> 0:20:32,200
 want to go to the big events too

447
0:20:32,200 --> 0:20:34,200
 so we want to avoid that and

448
0:20:34,200 --> 0:20:36,200
 I mean

449
0:20:36,200 --> 0:20:38,200
 moving it ahead a bit means that we dodge

450
0:20:38,200 --> 0:20:40,200
 both the big German and the big

451
0:20:40,200 --> 0:20:42,200
 Dutch events there will be other conflicts

452
0:20:42,200 --> 0:20:44,200
 some people might be unable to attend

453
0:20:44,200 --> 0:20:46,200
 that have been coming for years we are very

454
0:20:46,200 --> 0:20:48,200
 sorry about that hopefully this will

455
0:20:48,200 --> 0:20:50,200
 allow other people to come and

456
0:20:50,200 --> 0:20:52,200
 at the very least it will make it so we

457
0:20:52,200 --> 0:20:54,200
 don't have to ask the venue people to

458
0:20:54,200 --> 0:20:56,200
 move other people who rented the venue

459
0:20:56,200 --> 0:20:58,200
 where we needed so they have to

460
0:20:58,200 --> 0:21:00,200
 cancel other

461
0:21:00,200 --> 0:21:02,200
 renters at Hylkedam so they can

462
0:21:02,200 --> 0:21:04,200
 fit us in

463
0:21:04,200 --> 0:21:06,200
 they did it twice

464
0:21:06,200 --> 0:21:08,200
 and we've been here in four years and it's just

465
0:21:08,200 --> 0:21:10,200
 too stressful and it's too much to ask

466
0:21:10,200 --> 0:21:12,200
 we cannot keep doing this and we cannot

467
0:21:12,200 --> 0:21:14,200
 demand from CCC or the Dutch

468
0:21:14,200 --> 0:21:16,200
 events that they put their dates

469
0:21:16,200 --> 0:21:18,200
 out several years in advance

470
0:21:18,200 --> 0:21:20,200
 that's not going to happen the only way we can do

471
0:21:20,200 --> 0:21:22,200
 this is to kind of

472
0:21:22,200 --> 0:21:24,200
 roll with the punches and move

473
0:21:24,200 --> 0:21:26,200
 to a place in the calendar that

474
0:21:26,200 --> 0:21:28,200
 doesn't have so many big events

475
0:21:28,200 --> 0:21:30,200
 so BornHack 2024

476
0:21:30,200 --> 0:21:32,200
 will be from the 17th to the 24th

477
0:21:32,200 --> 0:21:34,200
 of July we hope very much to

478
0:21:34,200 --> 0:21:36,200
 see you all there

479
0:21:46,200 --> 0:21:48,200
 speaking of avoiding Hacker Blues

480
0:21:48,200 --> 0:21:50,200
 another way of doing that is just to keep

481
0:21:50,200 --> 0:21:52,200
 on trucking when we're done with

482
0:21:52,200 --> 0:21:54,200
 Teardown we will

483
0:21:54,200 --> 0:21:56,200
 repeat our great

484
0:21:56,200 --> 0:21:58,200
 success from 2019

485
0:21:58,200 --> 0:22:00,200
 where the CCC camp was also right after

486
0:22:00,200 --> 0:22:02,200
 BornHack what we did was basically

487
0:22:02,200 --> 0:22:04,200
 finish Teardown pack everything

488
0:22:04,200 --> 0:22:06,200
 and then do a big convoy of

489
0:22:06,200 --> 0:22:08,200
 10-15 vehicles and just drive

490
0:22:08,200 --> 0:22:10,200
 down there with radios and

491
0:22:10,200 --> 0:22:12,200
 everything it was amazingly

492
0:22:12,200 --> 0:22:14,200
 good fun and we arrived

493
0:22:14,200 --> 0:22:16,200
 at CCC camp

494
0:22:16,200 --> 0:22:18,200
 maybe one vehicle didn't

495
0:22:18,200 --> 0:22:20,200
 get there until 48 hours later

496
0:22:20,200 --> 0:22:22,200
 it's quite a story you can ask Omni about that

497
0:22:22,200 --> 0:22:24,200
 but mostly

498
0:22:24,200 --> 0:22:26,200
 it went very well

499
0:22:26,200 --> 0:22:28,200
 and we are repeating it

500
0:22:28,200 --> 0:22:30,200
 so as soon as we are done here

501
0:22:30,200 --> 0:22:32,200
 everybody gets in their cars and we

502
0:22:32,200 --> 0:22:34,200
 drive

503
0:22:34,200 --> 0:22:36,200
 to CCC camp

504
0:22:36,200 --> 0:22:38,200
 you are welcome to

505
0:22:38,200 --> 0:22:40,200
 if you need to leave and come

506
0:22:40,200 --> 0:22:42,200
 back you can do that but most people will probably

507
0:22:42,200 --> 0:22:44,200
 stay and help with Teardown and then leave

508
0:22:44,200 --> 0:22:46,200
 when we are done it should be good fun

509
0:22:46,200 --> 0:22:48,200
 and it's a good way to recover

510
0:22:48,200 --> 0:22:50,200
 what better way to recover from BornHack

511
0:22:50,200 --> 0:22:52,200
 than by going to another

512
0:22:52,200 --> 0:22:54,200
 hacker camp

513
0:22:58,200 --> 0:23:00,200
 okay we have some inventory

514
0:23:00,200 --> 0:23:02,200
 left in the bar that we don't want to

515
0:23:02,200 --> 0:23:04,200
 carry around too much we would like

516
0:23:04,200 --> 0:23:06,200
 all of you to take it home

517
0:23:06,200 --> 0:23:08,200
 so we are selling booze bottles

518
0:23:08,200 --> 0:23:10,200
 and infodesk at reduced prices

519
0:23:10,200 --> 0:23:12,200
 you can get a full bottle for

520
0:23:12,200 --> 0:23:14,200
 200 hacks instead of 300

521
0:23:14,200 --> 0:23:16,200
 and there is Ackervit

522
0:23:16,200 --> 0:23:18,200
 and vodka and Säbeblöd

523
0:23:18,200 --> 0:23:20,200
 up there also mate

524
0:23:20,200 --> 0:23:22,200
 and beer I think

525
0:23:22,200 --> 0:23:24,200
 it should be already ready in the infodesk

526
0:23:24,200 --> 0:23:26,200
 I don't think they will open about now

527
0:23:26,200 --> 0:23:28,200
 and be open today

528
0:23:28,200 --> 0:23:30,200
 and also tomorrow

529
0:23:30,200 --> 0:23:32,200
 so when you leave

530
0:23:32,200 --> 0:23:34,200
 or about to leave consider going by there

531
0:23:34,200 --> 0:23:36,200
 and getting some nice Säbeblöd

532
0:23:36,200 --> 0:23:38,200
 or Ackervit or vodka to take home

533
0:23:40,200 --> 0:23:42,200
 it is also a good way to get rid of the hacker blues

534
0:23:48,200 --> 0:23:50,200
 okay I'm almost done

535
0:23:50,200 --> 0:23:52,200
 we would like some help

536
0:23:52,200 --> 0:23:54,200
 right now with taking down the speakers tent

537
0:23:54,200 --> 0:23:56,200
 this is a massively parallelizable

538
0:23:56,200 --> 0:23:58,200
 job we could almost do it

539
0:23:58,200 --> 0:24:00,200
 with the GPU

540
0:24:00,200 --> 0:24:02,200
 but we do need some help

541
0:24:02,200 --> 0:24:04,200
 so

542
0:24:04,200 --> 0:24:06,200
 it is

543
0:24:06,200 --> 0:24:08,200
 once people get up and start running

544
0:24:08,200 --> 0:24:10,200
 around it gets a bit chaotic

545
0:24:10,200 --> 0:24:12,200
 so I'm going to go over it slowly

546
0:24:12,200 --> 0:24:14,200
 and explain what we would like

547
0:24:14,200 --> 0:24:16,200
 and once we start

548
0:24:16,200 --> 0:24:18,200
 please everybody be careful

549
0:24:18,200 --> 0:24:20,200
 nobody hurt themselves we used to time

550
0:24:20,200 --> 0:24:22,200
 taking down of the speakers tent

551
0:24:22,200 --> 0:24:24,200
 we don't do that anymore because people are way too competitive

552
0:24:24,200 --> 0:24:26,200
 and will end up hurting themselves

553
0:24:26,200 --> 0:24:28,200
 and we of course

554
0:24:28,200 --> 0:24:30,200
 don't want that

555
0:24:30,200 --> 0:24:32,200
 we have a bunch of helmets that we are getting

556
0:24:32,200 --> 0:24:34,200
 for when the frame has to come down

557
0:24:34,200 --> 0:24:36,200
 but before all that

558
0:24:36,200 --> 0:24:38,200
 the very first thing is

559
0:24:38,200 --> 0:24:40,200
 you get up take the chair you are sitting on

560
0:24:40,200 --> 0:24:42,200
 and take it to the car

561
0:24:42,200 --> 0:24:44,200
 park right outside and stack it inside

562
0:24:44,200 --> 0:24:46,200
 that I'm guessing

563
0:24:46,200 --> 0:24:48,200
 two people inside it to stack

564
0:24:48,200 --> 0:24:50,200
 and then an anthill

565
0:24:50,200 --> 0:24:52,200
 of people taking out chairs

566
0:24:52,200 --> 0:24:54,200
 after that

567
0:24:54,200 --> 0:24:56,200
 we are taking out all the tables

568
0:24:56,200 --> 0:24:58,200
 there is a row of metal frames

569
0:24:58,200 --> 0:25:00,200
 out here the tables go on the metal frame

570
0:25:00,200 --> 0:25:02,200
 20 high or so

571
0:25:02,200 --> 0:25:04,200
 and then they get a ratchet strap

572
0:25:04,200 --> 0:25:06,200
 there will be organizers in these black

573
0:25:06,200 --> 0:25:08,200
 auger vests at all the stacks

574
0:25:08,200 --> 0:25:10,200
 and they know all of them know

575
0:25:10,200 --> 0:25:12,200
 how to stack it

576
0:25:12,200 --> 0:25:14,200
 so there is nothing worse than having

577
0:25:14,200 --> 0:25:16,200
 to restack a stack

578
0:25:16,200 --> 0:25:18,200
 of tables that turned out to be stacked wrongly

579
0:25:18,200 --> 0:25:20,200
 or a stack of floor plates

580
0:25:20,200 --> 0:25:22,200
 in two or three days

581
0:25:22,200 --> 0:25:24,200
 before they pick it up because our arms

582
0:25:24,200 --> 0:25:26,200
 are hanging down there at that point

583
0:25:26,200 --> 0:25:28,200
 so let's get it right the first time

584
0:25:28,200 --> 0:25:30,200
 so it's much better to do it a little slowly

585
0:25:30,200 --> 0:25:32,200
 a little more slowly

586
0:25:32,200 --> 0:25:34,200
 than to get it wrong and we have to redo it

587
0:25:34,200 --> 0:25:36,200
 and especially the chairs

588
0:25:36,200 --> 0:25:38,200
 sorry the tables and the floor plates

589
0:25:38,200 --> 0:25:40,200
 have historically been

590
0:25:40,200 --> 0:25:42,200
 sources of

591
0:25:42,200 --> 0:25:44,200
 restacking work

592
0:25:44,200 --> 0:25:46,200
 so let's get it right

593
0:25:46,200 --> 0:25:48,200
 and just check with the vests before you leave anything

594
0:25:48,200 --> 0:25:50,200
 even though you think you might know

595
0:25:50,200 --> 0:25:52,200
 it's a very

596
0:25:52,200 --> 0:25:54,200
 we're all very capable in our

597
0:25:54,200 --> 0:25:56,200
 daily work and stuff and it's easy to

598
0:25:56,200 --> 0:25:58,200
 I know how to do this I'll just get it going

599
0:25:58,200 --> 0:26:00,200
 but please check with somebody in a vest

600
0:26:00,200 --> 0:26:02,200
 before you place things

601
0:26:02,200 --> 0:26:04,200
 the chairs go to the auger van

602
0:26:04,200 --> 0:26:06,200
 the tables go on the

603
0:26:06,200 --> 0:26:08,200
 the frames

604
0:26:08,200 --> 0:26:10,200
 out here and the floors go

605
0:26:10,200 --> 0:26:12,200
 on the wooden pallets that have the big

606
0:26:12,200 --> 0:26:14,200
 wooden plates on top

607
0:26:14,200 --> 0:26:16,200
 the floors

608
0:26:16,200 --> 0:26:18,200
 the floors

609
0:26:18,200 --> 0:26:20,200
 kind of snap into each other when you stack them

610
0:26:20,200 --> 0:26:22,200
 so it's not like a pile

611
0:26:22,200 --> 0:26:24,200
 it's a very neat pile when you're done

612
0:26:24,200 --> 0:26:26,200
 so they click into each other

613
0:26:26,200 --> 0:26:28,200
 so they're completely straight the sides

614
0:26:28,200 --> 0:26:30,200
 so if they're not straight they have to be

615
0:26:30,200 --> 0:26:32,200
 restacked so put it down

616
0:26:32,200 --> 0:26:34,200
 get it into place so it clicks in

617
0:26:34,200 --> 0:26:36,200
 and then put the next one in

618
0:26:36,200 --> 0:26:38,200
 the video team

619
0:26:38,200 --> 0:26:40,200
 will start taking down all this stuff

620
0:26:40,200 --> 0:26:42,200
 and they will

621
0:26:42,200 --> 0:26:44,200
 handle that themselves

622
0:26:44,200 --> 0:26:46,200
 so tables and chairs and when we're done with that

623
0:26:46,200 --> 0:26:48,200
 we can start taking up the floor

624
0:26:48,200 --> 0:26:50,200
 and putting that down and taking down the sides

625
0:26:50,200 --> 0:26:52,200
 and folding those and putting them on the pallets

626
0:26:52,200 --> 0:26:54,200
 if you have questions

627
0:26:54,200 --> 0:26:56,200
 or doubts then stop

628
0:26:56,200 --> 0:26:58,200
 working and just stand around

629
0:26:58,200 --> 0:27:00,200
 look what others are doing or come ask an auger person

630
0:27:00,200 --> 0:27:02,200
 much rather get it

631
0:27:02,200 --> 0:27:04,200
 right than doing it twice

632
0:27:08,200 --> 0:27:10,200
 that is it we love you all

633
0:27:10,200 --> 0:27:12,200
 we will see you next year and thank you for

634
0:27:12,200 --> 0:27:14,200
 everything

635
0:27:20,200 --> 0:27:24,200
 applause
