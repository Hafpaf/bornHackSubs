0:00:00,000 --> 0:00:13,360
 It has become possible, at least for all my webcam and screen share videos, so I'm going

2
0:00:13,360 --> 0:00:17,760
 to share that with you today, how that is helping me, and hopefully you can get some

3
0:00:17,760 --> 0:00:25,720
 inspiration from that, either to improve your own setup or to see, hey, okay, that's maybe

4
0:00:25,720 --> 0:00:33,400
 not so difficult. Maybe I can start putting some videos out there as well. So that's it.

5
0:00:33,400 --> 0:00:38,540
 Why am I doing this? Well, that's because 11 years ago, I quit my daytime job to become

6
0:00:38,540 --> 0:00:47,080
 a writing instructor. A year later, I figured out that being a self-employed writing instructor

7
0:00:47,080 --> 0:00:53,520
 with a small kid and a family you want to see sometimes, that's not super easy, so I

8
0:00:53,520 --> 0:00:55,720
 decided I would try to take some of that.

9
0:00:55,720 --> 0:01:02,080
 My teaching online, back then, 10 years ago, we were like two people in Denmark who did

10
0:01:02,080 --> 0:01:06,820
 online courses on horse training, so people were a bit like, oh, that's weird, but also

11
0:01:06,820 --> 0:01:13,060
 pretty interested because it brought some knowledge to them that they had a hard time

12
0:01:13,060 --> 0:01:19,140
 obtaining in other ways without driving a long while to get there or something like

13
0:01:19,140 --> 0:01:19,340
 that.

14
0:01:19,340 --> 0:01:25,680
 So this is me 10 years ago, almost to the date.

15
0:01:25,720 --> 0:01:28,040
 It was all bit women's 01s, but the thing was, I think that the technicalå¿ƒ tribal

16
0:01:28,040 --> 0:01:35,480
 issues imagining did a great job because I used to go out in Denmark as well with a couple

17
0:01:35,480 --> 0:01:40,620
 of women exchange lines and somethings and things, but not much you can do together.

18
0:01:40,620 --> 0:01:46,040
 It was, I don't want to complain, but you know, just being a kind-quality person, I

19
0:01:46,040 --> 0:01:54,840
 passed the four year, but I didn't seem to be able to get anywhere other than to train

20
0:01:54,840 --> 0:01:55,040
 my children.

21
0:01:55,040 --> 0:01:55,180
 Thank you.

22
0:01:55,180 --> 0:01:55,560
 Thank you.

23
0:01:55,560 --> 0:01:55,620
 Thank you.

24
0:01:55,620 --> 0:01:55,680
 Thank you, Kai.

25
0:01:55,680 --> 0:01:55,720
 Thank you.

26
0:01:55,720 --> 0:02:01,060
 not so super, also the internet connection back then was like

27
0:02:01,060 --> 0:02:04,900
 terrible, but I managed.

28
0:02:04,900 --> 0:02:08,200
 It

29
0:02:08,200 --> 0:02:11,220
 improved a wee bit pretty fast by

30
0:02:11,220 --> 0:02:15,280
 switching webinar provider.

31
0:02:15,280 --> 0:02:19,380
 I've always been

32
0:02:19,380 --> 0:02:23,760
 sort of both compassionate but also a bit

33
0:02:23,760 --> 0:02:29,260
 picky about how my teaching content shall be because I know

34
0:02:29,260 --> 0:02:33,440
 it makes a difference for people. I've used to be a teacher and

35
0:02:33,440 --> 0:02:36,700
 I know it makes a difference to people if you're just

36
0:02:36,700 --> 0:02:40,080
 providing them talking slides

37
0:02:40,080 --> 0:02:43,520
 or if you actually are there on webcam. Even if it's

38
0:02:43,520 --> 0:02:46,600
 a grainy old webcam with a fussy

39
0:02:46,600 --> 0:02:51,840
 image, it makes a difference that people can actually see you and can feel a

40
0:02:51,840 --> 0:02:53,040
 connection to you

41
0:02:53,040 --> 0:02:56,400
 when you're teaching online. So

42
0:02:56,400 --> 0:03:00,360
 I upgraded my system to something where I actually felt that

43
0:03:00,360 --> 0:03:03,980
 they could see me better

44
0:03:03,980 --> 0:03:08,420
 and that worked.

45
0:03:08,420 --> 0:03:13,860
 Then I started doing

46
0:03:13,860 --> 0:03:19,180
 also not just live webinars but also recording videos and this here, this is

47
0:03:19,180 --> 0:03:22,720
 some of the videos that took a long time to produce compared to

48
0:03:22,720 --> 0:03:27,780
 the video time because I had to record the slides

49
0:03:27,780 --> 0:03:32,180
 presentation first or have the images for that and put into my video editor.

50
0:03:32,180 --> 0:03:34,900
 Then I had to sit there and talk about the slides,

51
0:03:34,900 --> 0:03:38,740
 record that, put them together, put the logo on,

52
0:03:38,740 --> 0:03:42,220
 put the text on and

53
0:03:42,220 --> 0:03:46,720
 that took usually longer than actually doing the video.

54
0:03:46,720 --> 0:03:51,040
 Then the video had to process afterwards before I could upload it.

55
0:03:51,040 --> 0:03:52,080
 It was boring.

56
0:03:52,720 --> 0:03:57,360
 That is like 2015.

57
0:03:57,360 --> 0:04:04,380
 Then in 18, as I said, I met OBS at my first born hack.

58
0:04:04,380 --> 0:04:11,160
 I had been looking at it previously because I heard someone talk about it at some

59
0:04:11,160 --> 0:04:17,480
 marketing webinar I had attended but it was like, ah, it's a bit, it's difficult and I

60
0:04:17,480 --> 0:04:20,860
 don't really know what to do about it.

61
0:04:20,860 --> 0:04:22,720
 But then when I had my hands in it at

62
0:04:22,720 --> 0:04:27,200
 born hack, I was like, yeah, okay, oh, so there's something about scenes and there's

63
0:04:27,200 --> 0:04:29,880
 something about sources, ah, I get that now.

64
0:04:29,880 --> 0:04:32,380
 I can go back and use this.

65
0:04:32,380 --> 0:04:37,440
 Still took me six months because as far as I could tell when I was digging through my

66
0:04:37,440 --> 0:04:44,040
 archives yesterday, I only started using OBS in January 2019.

67
0:04:44,040 --> 0:04:47,600
 So that's like almost four and a half years ago now.

68
0:04:47,600 --> 0:04:51,360
 This is one of the first attempts.

69
0:04:51,360 --> 0:04:59,120
 The video series where I put myself in in the corner and I had some background images

70
0:04:59,120 --> 0:05:06,100
 that I could switch like slides and that worked really well and it was still like a one-take

71
0:05:06,100 --> 0:05:07,340
 video.

72
0:05:07,340 --> 0:05:13,020
 Of course, doing one-take videos means that you need to actually know what you're going

73
0:05:13,020 --> 0:05:20,240
 to talk about and not make that many mistakes and stuff, but today I much rather do, if

74
0:05:20,240 --> 0:05:21,240
 I'm doing like a 10-minute video.

75
0:05:21,240 --> 0:05:21,340
 10 minutes.

76
0:05:21,360 --> 0:05:27,360
 I try not to make them longer, but if I'm doing like a 10-minute video or 5-minute video,

77
0:05:27,360 --> 0:05:30,360
 if something goes wrong, I just restart.

78
0:05:30,360 --> 0:05:38,300
 It's a lot faster than actually having to go back and edit out a cough attack or whatever.

79
0:05:38,300 --> 0:05:47,340
 So it really, really helps my flow in content creation.

80
0:05:47,340 --> 0:05:51,240
 This is then in May 2019 where I started doing.

81
0:05:51,240 --> 0:05:53,240
 I started doing screen share videos.

82
0:05:53,240 --> 0:05:59,340
 My business had then moved on from doing, as you can see, this has not much to do with

83
0:05:59,340 --> 0:06:01,980
 horses.

84
0:06:01,980 --> 0:06:09,000
 I'm now primarily teaching other people how to use the online course and email marketing

85
0:06:09,000 --> 0:06:10,860
 system called Simplero.

86
0:06:10,860 --> 0:06:17,240
 I've been doing that since 2015, 16, where it slowly took over.

87
0:06:17,240 --> 0:06:19,240
 So, today, my main video production is Simplero.

88
0:06:19,240 --> 0:06:20,240
 I've been doing that since 2015, 16, where it slowly took over.

89
0:06:20,240 --> 0:06:21,240
 So today, my main video production is Simplero.

90
0:06:21,240 --> 0:06:22,240
 So, today, my main video production is Simplero.

91
0:06:22,240 --> 0:06:23,240
 So, today, my main video production is Simplero.

92
0:06:23,240 --> 0:06:24,240
 So, today, my main video production is Simplero.

93
0:06:24,240 --> 0:06:25,240
 So, today, my main video production is Simplero.

94
0:06:25,240 --> 0:06:26,240
 I started doing all this videos where I'm on screen share and I show something from

95
0:06:26,240 --> 0:06:34,520
 inside Simplero and tell people how to set up a course or create an email series or do

96
0:06:34,520 --> 0:06:39,860
 fancy automation stuff.

97
0:06:39,860 --> 0:06:49,200
 So, I started doing these courses also back sometime in 2019 and this is what it looked

98
0:06:49,200 --> 0:06:50,280
 like back then.

99
0:06:50,280 --> 0:06:51,120
 So, today, I'm going to be inspiring my customers to use my inland work.

100
0:06:51,120 --> 0:06:54,700
 And this is then what it looks like today.

101
0:06:54,700 --> 0:06:56,800
 I've gone to green screen.

102
0:06:56,800 --> 0:07:01,000
 So now I can just put myself in without sitting in a square

103
0:07:01,000 --> 0:07:04,140
 with some sort of background.

104
0:07:04,140 --> 0:07:09,740
 That's really nice, and that's also built in in OBS.

105
0:07:09,740 --> 0:07:12,660
 Also, I use this to stream.

106
0:07:12,660 --> 0:07:15,480
 This is actually from, I have like a membership club

107
0:07:15,480 --> 0:07:17,180
 for people who are using Simplero.

108
0:07:17,180 --> 0:07:22,700
 And we do monthly themes, and they are like live streamed.

109
0:07:22,700 --> 0:07:25,700
 We have a Facebook group.

110
0:07:25,700 --> 0:07:29,240
 So I live stream it to the Facebook group using OBS.

111
0:07:29,240 --> 0:07:33,260
 So I get a high quality local recording of the stream,

112
0:07:33,260 --> 0:07:35,060
 because then it's not the stream.

113
0:07:35,060 --> 0:07:39,260
 Then it's just what's happening on my desktop.

114
0:07:39,260 --> 0:07:40,880
 Then I also stream it to Facebook.

115
0:07:40,880 --> 0:07:44,440
 And then afterwards, I take the recorded video

116
0:07:44,440 --> 0:07:47,060
 from my desktop computer and upload it

117
0:07:47,060 --> 0:07:47,180
 to Simplero.

118
0:07:47,180 --> 0:07:49,300
 So the course material in Simplero.

119
0:07:49,300 --> 0:07:52,120
 So I have both this option.

120
0:07:52,120 --> 0:07:53,220
 I don't know.

121
0:07:53,220 --> 0:07:55,440
 You're probably not that much of a Facebook crowd.

122
0:07:55,440 --> 0:07:57,140
 But in Facebook, if you do live, you

123
0:07:57,140 --> 0:07:59,780
 can either do screen share or do webcam.

124
0:07:59,780 --> 0:08:01,300
 You can't combine them.

125
0:08:01,300 --> 0:08:05,600
 When I use OBS to stream, I can combine totally like I want.

126
0:08:05,600 --> 0:08:08,540
 So I have full control.

127
0:08:08,540 --> 0:08:13,900
 And I get the local recording in high quality.

128
0:08:13,900 --> 0:08:17,060
 And I could also use this to stream to YouTube or any other

129
0:08:17,060 --> 0:08:23,360
 service where you can stream with a stream key.

130
0:08:23,360 --> 0:08:27,660
 So that's really, really nice.

131
0:08:27,660 --> 0:08:29,760
 And that makes my work so much easier also.

132
0:08:32,880 --> 0:08:38,280
 I've also been doing like if you want

133
0:08:38,280 --> 0:08:42,400
 to teach something about like a creative process or thought

134
0:08:42,400 --> 0:08:45,140
 process, then it's not always the best.

135
0:08:45,140 --> 0:08:46,940
 Like people get so much, especially

136
0:08:46,940 --> 0:08:51,580
 during corona, people had so much of everything being online

137
0:08:51,580 --> 0:08:56,980
 and people just doing talking slide presentations.

138
0:08:56,980 --> 0:09:01,460
 And it kind of gets boring.

139
0:09:01,460 --> 0:09:03,440
 If you need to keep people's attention,

140
0:09:03,440 --> 0:09:05,140
 then you should mix things up.

141
0:09:05,140 --> 0:09:08,840
 So what I have on my desk is I have a second webcam mounted

142
0:09:08,840 --> 0:09:09,620
 on an arm.

143
0:09:09,620 --> 0:09:13,720
 So I can take that and point it down on my desk.

144
0:09:13,720 --> 0:09:16,560
 And then I can have a writing pad.

145
0:09:16,560 --> 0:09:16,820
 And I can.

146
0:09:16,820 --> 0:09:22,340
 I can sketch up things, either if I want to design flows

147
0:09:22,340 --> 0:09:25,940
 or I want to sketch out a thought process

148
0:09:25,940 --> 0:09:29,420
 or whatever it is I want to do.

149
0:09:29,420 --> 0:09:32,900
 I can actually do that and put that on webcam as well.

150
0:09:32,900 --> 0:09:36,320
 And then I still have myself down in the corner.

151
0:09:36,320 --> 0:09:41,180
 So I can also look up, put down the pen, and sit there

152
0:09:41,180 --> 0:09:43,380
 and talk to people.

153
0:09:43,380 --> 0:09:45,440
 And this is, I know from my students,

154
0:09:45,440 --> 0:09:46,580
 that they are like.

155
0:09:46,580 --> 0:09:48,860
 I'm really happy about this way of doing things.

156
0:09:48,860 --> 0:09:52,100
 I could also be standing by a whiteboard or whatever

157
0:09:52,100 --> 0:09:54,820
 I wanted to do that was like something else.

158
0:09:54,820 --> 0:09:57,960
 I had been looking into, oh, maybe I

159
0:09:57,960 --> 0:10:02,020
 should get one of those fancy drawing pads for my computer.

160
0:10:02,020 --> 0:10:05,800
 And because I wanted to do some live drawing stuff,

161
0:10:05,800 --> 0:10:09,020
 and then I was like, hmm, I have an extra webcam.

162
0:10:09,020 --> 0:10:09,720
 I have pen.

163
0:10:09,720 --> 0:10:10,760
 I have paper.

164
0:10:10,760 --> 0:10:11,660
 How does that work?

165
0:10:11,660 --> 0:10:13,220
 And that actually works excellent.

166
0:10:13,220 --> 0:10:15,220
 So that's it.

167
0:10:15,220 --> 0:10:15,700
 Thank you.

168
0:10:15,700 --> 0:10:16,200
 Thank you.

169
0:10:16,200 --> 0:10:19,660
 So that's a way of mixing things up.

170
0:10:19,660 --> 0:10:23,440
 And that's totally easy to set up several camera sources

171
0:10:23,440 --> 0:10:26,240
 in OBS.

172
0:10:26,240 --> 0:10:29,900
 And I can switch between the scenes so that I can do this.

173
0:10:29,900 --> 0:10:32,780
 And then I can switch to another scene where I have screen share.

174
0:10:32,780 --> 0:10:36,680
 Or I can switch to another scene where it's just me on webcam.

175
0:10:36,680 --> 0:10:40,540
 And I can sort of spice my teaching up a bit

176
0:10:40,540 --> 0:10:45,680
 without having to do all that editing that, for me, I know

177
0:10:45,680 --> 0:10:48,240
 some people are probably editing faster than me.

178
0:10:48,240 --> 0:10:52,260
 But for me, at least, it takes a lot of time.

179
0:10:52,260 --> 0:10:54,600
 And it isn't really worth it.

180
0:10:54,600 --> 0:10:59,140
 I could maybe get like 2%, 3%, 4%, 5% fancier videos

181
0:10:59,140 --> 0:11:01,480
 if I decided to do after editing.

182
0:11:01,480 --> 0:11:05,240
 But that's really, really not worth it.

183
0:11:05,240 --> 0:11:11,720
 So this is how things look today.

184
0:11:11,720 --> 0:11:13,720
 This is how it looks from inside OBS.

185
0:11:13,720 --> 0:11:14,720
 And in a second, I'm going to show you how it looks from inside OBS.

186
0:11:14,720 --> 0:11:15,680
 And in a second, I'm going to show you how it looks from inside OBS.

187
0:11:15,680 --> 0:11:18,060
 I'm going to switch over so you can see.

188
0:11:18,060 --> 0:11:21,560
 I'm going to open OBS here on my machine.

189
0:11:21,560 --> 0:11:25,120
 And then we can take a look at how does this actually work.

190
0:11:25,120 --> 0:11:28,120
 How do we set it up?

191
0:11:28,120 --> 0:11:30,620
 What do you need to be aware of?

192
0:11:30,620 --> 0:11:33,580
 And then there will be some room for questions.

193
0:11:33,580 --> 0:11:36,160
 Yeah?

194
0:11:36,160 --> 0:11:36,660
 So.

195
0:11:44,780 --> 0:11:45,280
 Oh, yeah.

196
0:11:45,680 --> 0:11:46,560
 Just a second.

197
0:11:46,560 --> 0:11:48,620
 I wanted to show you my setup as well.

198
0:11:48,620 --> 0:11:52,940
 So this is my desktop at home being unusually tidy.

199
0:11:52,940 --> 0:11:54,320
 So I have like two screens.

200
0:11:54,320 --> 0:11:56,480
 Because if you're working with OBS,

201
0:11:56,480 --> 0:12:00,580
 you can do that in a one-screen setup.

202
0:12:00,580 --> 0:12:05,260
 But it's really, really, really nice to have like two screens.

203
0:12:05,260 --> 0:12:08,320
 So you can have whatever you are, if you're doing a screen share,

204
0:12:08,320 --> 0:12:11,600
 then you have whatever you're working with on the front screen.

205
0:12:11,600 --> 0:12:13,680
 And then you have OBS.

206
0:12:13,680 --> 0:12:15,560
 Or if you have some chat you need, you can do that.

207
0:12:15,560 --> 0:12:18,500
 But if you have something you need to pay attention to,

208
0:12:18,500 --> 0:12:21,320
 you have that on the other screen.

209
0:12:21,320 --> 0:12:22,940
 That's a really, really big help.

210
0:12:22,940 --> 0:12:26,660
 And I also highly recommend that, even if you don't use OBS,

211
0:12:26,660 --> 0:12:29,900
 if you're doing any other sort of webinars or anything

212
0:12:29,900 --> 0:12:36,020
 where you need to be able to both screen share something

213
0:12:36,020 --> 0:12:40,460
 or have your slides and also keep an eye on a chat

214
0:12:40,460 --> 0:12:45,440
 or some other tech that is running, it's really, really, really, a lot easier.

215
0:12:45,560 --> 0:12:49,020
 If you have at least two screens.

216
0:12:49,020 --> 0:12:53,620
 I teach a lot of my clients are like not very techie.

217
0:12:53,620 --> 0:12:56,180
 And when I come and say, yeah, you should probably

218
0:12:56,180 --> 0:12:57,200
 get an extra screen.

219
0:12:57,200 --> 0:13:00,820
 And they're like, but I only have my MacBook.

220
0:13:00,820 --> 0:13:03,920
 And then we'll have to figure out how to attach an extra screen

221
0:13:03,920 --> 0:13:07,860
 because it's just so much easier.

222
0:13:07,860 --> 0:13:12,180
 I have a microphone and I have an external webcam.

223
0:13:12,180 --> 0:13:14,660
 And that's basically it.

224
0:13:14,660 --> 0:13:19,420
 What you maybe can see in the corners of the desk

225
0:13:19,420 --> 0:13:26,080
 is I have a couple of, that's like 20 vat halogen, not halogen,

226
0:13:26,080 --> 0:13:31,340
 LED working lights that are pointing away from me

227
0:13:31,340 --> 0:13:34,520
 because they create a pretty good ambient light.

228
0:13:34,520 --> 0:13:43,260
 So that's a lot easier than buying some very fancy studio lights.

229
0:13:43,260 --> 0:13:43,960
 If you have some.

230
0:13:43,960 --> 0:13:44,460
 Why?

231
0:13:44,460 --> 0:13:44,660
 Why?

232
0:13:44,660 --> 0:13:47,940
 Oh, wait, is walls that you control the light up on

233
0:13:47,940 --> 0:13:52,620
 and then it comes back that that really makes a big difference.

234
0:13:52,620 --> 0:13:55,040
 I tried buying one of them.

235
0:13:55,040 --> 0:13:56,180
 Famous ring lights.

236
0:13:56,180 --> 0:13:58,060
 Because like there, so fancy, right?

237
0:13:58,060 --> 0:13:59,980
 But I have glasses.

238
0:13:59,980 --> 0:14:03,560
 And if you have glasses and you're sitting in front of a ring light,

239
0:14:03,560 --> 0:14:05,200
 you have ring light in your glasses.

240
0:14:05,200 --> 0:14:07,760
 And that doesn't really look that good on videos.

241
0:14:07,760 --> 0:14:10,760
 Actually you can see it in the, it's also

242
0:14:10,760 --> 0:14:13,500
 reflected in the eyes of people that have ring light.

243
0:14:13,500 --> 0:14:14,460
 So you can you can see it.

244
0:14:14,460 --> 0:14:17,460
 inside there, the irises.

245
0:14:17,460 --> 0:14:23,380
 So I still have the ring light, but now it's mounted under the ceiling and it's also pointing

246
0:14:23,380 --> 0:14:31,100
 away from me, so it's creating ambient light instead of shining directly in my eyes.

247
0:14:31,100 --> 0:14:35,480
 So that's the setup.

248
0:14:35,480 --> 0:14:45,640
 I also bought a low-noise mouse and keyboard, because I found out at some point that when

249
0:14:45,640 --> 0:14:50,720
 I was sitting doing things and setting things up and I needed to type, all that typing,

250
0:14:50,720 --> 0:14:57,660
 especially with the microphone so close to the keyboard, that was sort of annoying.

251
0:14:57,660 --> 0:15:03,720
 But basically, I would say get a decent webcam, get a second monitor so you have at least

252
0:15:03,720 --> 0:15:04,720
 two.

253
0:15:04,720 --> 0:15:05,480
 Okay.

254
0:15:05,480 --> 0:15:11,480
 And you can see here, this is my green screen setup, so this is, this image is looking the

255
0:15:11,480 --> 0:15:12,840
 other way.

256
0:15:12,840 --> 0:15:21,480
 My office is not very big, and I have my back up to a, what do you call that, a cabinet

257
0:15:21,480 --> 0:15:24,720
 with a lot of glassware.

258
0:15:24,720 --> 0:15:25,720
 It's brown.

259
0:15:25,720 --> 0:15:26,720
 It's not very pretty.

260
0:15:26,720 --> 0:15:30,300
 It showed on some of my first webinar videos.

261
0:15:30,300 --> 0:15:35,320
 Then I got a white roller blind that I couldn't put up, that I mounted in the ceiling, so

262
0:15:35,320 --> 0:15:40,140
 I could roll that down when I was doing videos, and I could pull it up again when I needed

263
0:15:40,140 --> 0:15:42,880
 to go to the cupboard behind me.

264
0:15:42,880 --> 0:15:51,420
 And now I've upgraded that, so now I have mounted just basically a piece of vibrant

265
0:15:51,420 --> 0:15:58,820
 green sheet on the roller blind, fastened it with magnets so it's easy to remove.

266
0:15:58,820 --> 0:16:01,000
 And that's my green screen.

267
0:16:01,000 --> 0:16:04,320
 And that's working really, really well.

268
0:16:04,320 --> 0:16:13,640
 So that's like a super cheap setup to get a green screen, so you can remove your background,

269
0:16:13,640 --> 0:16:16,320
 put yourself in any background you want.

270
0:16:16,320 --> 0:16:22,940
 Even when I'm doing, I do a lot of Zoom meetings, and Zoom also has all these virtual backgrounds

271
0:16:22,940 --> 0:16:29,480
 thing, but you can really, really see if people, I'm sure you have had meetings with people

272
0:16:29,480 --> 0:16:33,560
 that are using virtual background and are not sitting on like a uniform.

273
0:16:33,560 --> 0:16:40,240
 Then if they have a headset on, sometimes the headset disappears, sometimes their ears

274
0:16:40,240 --> 0:16:43,340
 disappear, sometimes their arms disappear.

275
0:16:43,340 --> 0:16:48,280
 If you're using a green screen and you tell Zoom that you actually have a green screen,

276
0:16:48,280 --> 0:16:50,940
 it is working much, much better.

277
0:16:50,940 --> 0:16:57,140
 So you won't be as fussy as the usual virtual background function.

278
0:16:57,140 --> 0:16:58,680
 So I really like that.

279
0:16:58,680 --> 0:17:01,880
 It has upped my game a lot.

280
0:17:01,880 --> 0:17:03,120
 Cheers.

281
0:17:03,560 --> 0:17:04,100
 Cheers.

282
0:17:10,340 --> 0:17:11,620
 Yeah.

283
0:17:11,620 --> 0:17:13,320
 I think that was the last slide.

284
0:17:13,320 --> 0:17:14,960
 Yes, it was.

285
0:17:14,960 --> 0:17:15,880
 Good.

286
0:17:15,880 --> 0:17:18,220
 So OBS.

287
0:17:18,220 --> 0:17:20,380
 Open Broadcaster Software.

288
0:17:20,380 --> 0:17:24,380
 It's open source, so it's free.

289
0:17:24,380 --> 0:17:26,860
 It's running on Windows, Mac, Linux.

290
0:17:26,860 --> 0:17:28,360
 I'm on a Linux machine.

291
0:17:31,260 --> 0:17:33,560
 And it runs real.

292
0:17:33,560 --> 0:17:45,720
 really well. It also had a built-in virtual webcam function, so like if you're using some

293
0:17:45,720 --> 0:17:51,160
 program where you need to put in your webcam that, for instance, the software I use for,

294
0:17:51,160 --> 0:17:58,040
 I use this really, it's a nice software to do webinars in called Webinar Jam, but the

295
0:17:58,040 --> 0:18:03,160
 customer support is like really, really crappy, so I can't really recommend them, but I signed

296
0:18:03,160 --> 0:18:10,580
 up so long ago that I'm like grandfathered into the big plan forever, so hey, it works,

297
0:18:10,580 --> 0:18:18,740
 and I like to use it, but I don't really recommend it, but they don't have a streaming function.

298
0:18:18,740 --> 0:18:24,140
 I can't put in, I can't get a stream key for them and then say I just want to stream my

299
0:18:24,140 --> 0:18:31,100
 OBS feed into Webinar Jam. I have to use my webcam, and can of course do slides and webcam

300
0:18:31,100 --> 0:18:32,980
 and stuff, but they don't have.

301
0:18:32,980 --> 0:18:36,680
 Now they have sort of a virtual background function for the webcam, but it's not very

302
0:18:36,680 --> 0:18:44,040
 good, so I'm like I would much rather just take my OBS feed, put that into Webinar Jam

303
0:18:44,040 --> 0:18:52,300
 or whatever else service I'm using, and now there's a virtual webcam function in OBS,

304
0:18:52,300 --> 0:19:00,160
 so I can just tell Webinar Jam to use my virtual webcam. That's not super, there's sometimes

305
0:19:00,160 --> 0:19:02,920
 a bit of a delay, so it's not necessarily super good for Zoom.

306
0:19:02,980 --> 0:19:03,980
 But I think that I can do it.

307
0:19:03,980 --> 0:19:10,840
 If you're using a virtual meeting, you can do it, but those real time meetings is maybe

308
0:19:10,840 --> 0:19:17,220
 not always the good solution, but it can be done. But it works super well for webinars,

309
0:19:17,220 --> 0:19:23,360
 and that makes it a lot easier. Then I don't have to use all the controls in the webinar

310
0:19:23,360 --> 0:19:30,040
 program to switch between slides and webcam, and I just do everything in OBS as I used

311
0:19:30,040 --> 0:19:31,040
 to do.

312
0:19:31,040 --> 0:19:35,800
 And I can even make the local recording in OBS as well to get the high-quality recording

313
0:19:35,800 --> 0:19:37,600
 that I want.

314
0:19:37,600 --> 0:19:40,060
 So I love OBS.

315
0:19:40,060 --> 0:19:46,080
 It's like one of my absolutely favorite tools.

316
0:19:46,080 --> 0:19:49,500
 So what does it look like?

317
0:19:49,500 --> 0:19:58,640
 I do run a slightly old version on my laptop for some reason, so it might look slightly

318
0:19:58,640 --> 0:20:03,540
 different if you go and install a new version now.

319
0:20:03,540 --> 0:20:09,080
 I just only realized a few days ago, and then I didn't want to rock the boat by running

320
0:20:09,080 --> 0:20:11,900
 a big upgrade.

321
0:20:11,900 --> 0:20:13,960
 But the principles are the same.

322
0:20:13,960 --> 0:20:19,600
 What we have here is you can put it in down here I have studio mode.

323
0:20:19,600 --> 0:20:24,300
 This is what we have here where we have like a preview screen and a program screen.

324
0:20:24,300 --> 0:20:28,640
 Actually, those of you that can see the setup up here, where we're using the

325
0:20:28,640 --> 0:20:32,080
 black magic box, it has the same principle.

326
0:20:32,080 --> 0:20:39,520
 You have program, that is what we are streaming live or showing or recording, and preview

327
0:20:39,520 --> 0:20:47,340
 is what we will, if we click the transit button, get instead of what we are recording or streaming

328
0:20:47,340 --> 0:20:48,340
 now.

329
0:20:48,340 --> 0:20:55,400
 So that's like the main setup that we have these two scenes that we're looking at.

330
0:20:55,400 --> 0:20:58,620
 And a scene in OBS is like a combination of

331
0:20:58,620 --> 0:20:59,920
 sources.

332
0:20:59,920 --> 0:21:03,920
 So you can have a number of scenes that you're switching between.

333
0:21:03,920 --> 0:21:06,640
 This scene I have right here.

334
0:21:06,640 --> 0:21:08,100
 And this is if it's in studio mode.

335
0:21:08,100 --> 0:21:11,760
 I can also just say I'm only doing like one scene.

336
0:21:11,760 --> 0:21:13,380
 I don't want the studio mode thing.

337
0:21:13,380 --> 0:21:21,340
 But I really like that I can have usually what I'm doing is I have one scene that is

338
0:21:21,340 --> 0:21:28,380
 just me and webcam, maybe with a background image of like I have

339
0:21:28,380 --> 0:21:28,580
 the

340
0:21:28,620 --> 0:21:33,420
 a starting slide or something like that, or title slide.

341
0:21:33,420 --> 0:21:35,720
 So I have that as the background.

342
0:21:35,720 --> 0:21:43,080
 And then I switch to me with screen share and the webcam.

343
0:21:43,080 --> 0:21:46,140
 And of course, at home, I have the green screen.

344
0:21:46,140 --> 0:21:51,120
 So what we have here is we put in the scene.

345
0:21:51,120 --> 0:21:52,260
 So we have a scene.

346
0:21:52,260 --> 0:21:54,920
 And we can rename that to something.

347
0:21:54,920 --> 0:21:58,380
 That makes sense.

348
0:21:58,380 --> 0:21:59,380
 That makes sense.

349
0:21:59,380 --> 0:22:02,620
 So we could call this one.

350
0:22:02,620 --> 0:22:04,620
 That didn't really work.

351
0:22:04,620 --> 0:22:06,480
 Yes, it did work.

352
0:22:06,480 --> 0:22:17,080
 So we call this webcam and screen.

353
0:22:17,080 --> 0:22:21,900
 So that's one scene.

354
0:22:21,900 --> 0:22:25,400
 And I can have here I have now I have adjusted some resolution.

355
0:22:25,400 --> 0:22:28,220
 So I have to like if I can

356
0:22:28,220 --> 0:22:29,220
 do this.

357
0:22:29,220 --> 0:22:41,240
 I'm moving that one.

358
0:22:41,240 --> 0:22:50,220
 This is a lot easier with a real mouse, you know.

359
0:22:50,220 --> 0:22:57,220
 There we go.

360
0:22:57,220 --> 0:22:59,560
 There we go.

361
0:22:59,560 --> 0:23:04,720
 And now I move the video capture device somewhere else.

362
0:23:04,720 --> 0:23:07,220
 I need to see if I can grab that and drag it back in.

363
0:23:07,220 --> 0:23:11,220
 There it goes.

364
0:23:11,220 --> 0:23:12,220
 There.

365
0:23:12,220 --> 0:23:15,220
 So I can put myself in the corner here.

366
0:23:15,220 --> 0:23:16,220
 Here it goes.

367
0:23:16,220 --> 0:23:17,220
 Yes.

368
0:23:17,220 --> 0:23:23,220
 So that is like we have a screen with screen share and the webcam.

369
0:23:23,220 --> 0:23:26,980
 That would be a quite usual setup for me.

370
0:23:26,980 --> 0:23:34,980
 I could also put in my logo and some text at the bottom if I wanted to do that.

371
0:23:34,980 --> 0:23:41,980
 Then if I say, hey, I want to have another screen that is just me on the webcam maybe,

372
0:23:41,980 --> 0:23:44,980
 then I go and say here I can add a scene.

373
0:23:44,980 --> 0:23:48,980
 There's a little plus down here.

374
0:23:48,980 --> 0:23:52,980
 So add a scene and then we call that just webcam.

375
0:23:52,980 --> 0:23:54,980
 And it's a really good idea.

376
0:23:54,980 --> 0:23:56,980
 Tiny piece of advice.

377
0:23:56,980 --> 0:24:01,980
 Label your scenes in a sane way.

378
0:24:01,980 --> 0:24:07,980
 Because like three years later, when you're running still on the same setup,

379
0:24:07,980 --> 0:24:13,980
 and you have like 20 different scenes and they are all labeled something weird,

380
0:24:13,980 --> 0:24:19,980
 it makes it a bit hard to go in and see what is actually the two scenes I need to use today.

381
0:24:19,980 --> 0:24:21,980
 That will, of course, never happen.

382
0:24:21,980 --> 0:24:22,980
 But I'm going to do that.

383
0:24:22,980 --> 0:24:23,980
 I'm going to do that.

384
0:24:23,980 --> 0:24:24,980
 Okay.

385
0:24:24,980 --> 0:24:27,980
 I don't know what happened to you, but that happened to me.

386
0:24:27,980 --> 0:24:29,980
 So label it.

387
0:24:29,980 --> 0:24:33,980
 Then we have to go here and see now it says here we don't have any sources.

388
0:24:33,980 --> 0:24:34,980
 Yeah, I know.

389
0:24:34,980 --> 0:24:38,980
 So I go and add a source.

390
0:24:38,980 --> 0:24:42,980
 And I say I want, since this one was supposed to be webcam only,

391
0:24:42,980 --> 0:24:50,980
 I go and add a video capture device.

392
0:24:50,980 --> 0:24:53,980
 And since I already have...

393
0:24:53,980 --> 0:25:00,980
 An input device for my built-in webcam, I just go and say I want to add this one.

394
0:25:00,980 --> 0:25:03,980
 So I click add existing, and then I can take this one.

395
0:25:03,980 --> 0:25:05,980
 And I can say okay.

396
0:25:05,980 --> 0:25:07,980
 So now I have the webcam.

397
0:25:07,980 --> 0:25:10,980
 Then we can say...

398
0:25:10,980 --> 0:25:12,980
 And it's...

399
0:25:12,980 --> 0:25:16,980
 Then we can see, oh, but it's four by three.

400
0:25:16,980 --> 0:25:18,980
 It's not 69.

401
0:25:18,980 --> 0:25:21,980
 So I can go and right-click this one.

402
0:25:21,980 --> 0:25:26,980
 And we can say settings, properties.

403
0:25:26,980 --> 0:25:30,980
 I'm going to show you how to do the green screen as well in a moment.

404
0:25:30,980 --> 0:25:33,980
 So I have here...

405
0:25:33,980 --> 0:25:35,980
 I can see what is this...

406
0:25:35,980 --> 0:25:37,980
 What's the device?

407
0:25:37,980 --> 0:25:39,980
 It's input one.

408
0:25:39,980 --> 0:25:41,980
 What's the video format?

409
0:25:41,980 --> 0:25:42,980
 Resolution.

410
0:25:42,980 --> 0:25:45,980
 Then I can say, hey, can this actually do...

411
0:25:45,980 --> 0:25:49,980
 It can do 1280 by 720.

412
0:25:49,980 --> 0:25:50,980
 So that's at least 69.

413
0:25:50,980 --> 0:25:54,980
 That was what I wanted.

414
0:25:54,980 --> 0:25:59,980
 I can change the frame rate.

415
0:25:59,980 --> 0:26:01,980
 So it can only...

416
0:26:01,980 --> 0:26:07,980
 It can only do a frame rate of 10 if I set the resolution to 720.

417
0:26:07,980 --> 0:26:12,980
 So that's maybe not so impressive.

418
0:26:12,980 --> 0:26:18,980
 And there's also something about color range.

419
0:26:18,980 --> 0:26:27,980
 This is also where you can experiment with if your color settings are not correct, if you need it to zoom in or something like that.

420
0:26:27,980 --> 0:26:35,980
 You set that here under setting for the camera.

421
0:26:35,980 --> 0:26:43,980
 You have all these settings here, like set the power line frequency to 50 and stuff like that.

422
0:26:43,980 --> 0:26:47,980
 So you have all the controls for your webcam inside.

423
0:26:47,980 --> 0:26:52,980
 OPS are small.

424
0:26:52,980 --> 0:26:53,980
 Then...

425
0:26:53,980 --> 0:26:55,980
 And see now we changed the resolution.

426
0:26:55,980 --> 0:26:59,980
 So now it got like way too big.

427
0:26:59,980 --> 0:27:00,980
 Oops.

428
0:27:00,980 --> 0:27:10,980
 That was not what I tried to do.

429
0:27:10,980 --> 0:27:15,980
 So we just need it to exactly fit here.

430
0:27:15,980 --> 0:27:16,980
 Bridge.

431
0:27:17,980 --> 0:27:25,980
 So that goes, fits.

432
0:27:25,980 --> 0:27:36,980
 So if this was at home and I was using my green screen, then I would also add the filter.

433
0:27:36,980 --> 0:27:39,980
 Because green screen, that lives in filters.

434
0:27:39,980 --> 0:27:43,980
 So I go down here to the bottom and I pick filters.

435
0:27:43,980 --> 0:27:45,980
 And then I can say I want to...

436
0:27:47,980 --> 0:27:51,980
 Add an effect filter.

437
0:27:51,980 --> 0:27:57,980
 If I could get to the bottom of this.

438
0:27:57,980 --> 0:28:03,980
 Oh, my screen is too small.

439
0:28:03,980 --> 0:28:12,980
 How do I do that?

440
0:28:12,980 --> 0:28:15,980
 Now that's a good question.

441
0:28:15,980 --> 0:28:25,980
 There goes.

442
0:28:25,980 --> 0:28:30,980
 So here I have the effect filters and I want to add that.

443
0:28:30,980 --> 0:28:33,980
 And I have what's called a chroma key.

444
0:28:33,980 --> 0:28:35,980
 And that is the...

445
0:28:35,980 --> 0:28:37,980
 So chroma, that's something with color.

446
0:28:37,980 --> 0:28:43,980
 So we need to fill out and call this one green screen.

447
0:28:43,980 --> 0:28:49,980
 So I can remember what it is.

448
0:28:49,980 --> 0:28:54,980
 And then I can choose what type of screen am I sitting with.

449
0:28:54,980 --> 0:28:58,980
 Do I have a green, blue, magenta, or custom color?

450
0:28:58,980 --> 0:29:03,980
 Sometimes you need to say custom.

451
0:29:03,980 --> 0:29:06,980
 And then give it a slightly...

452
0:29:06,980 --> 0:29:11,980
 If your green screen is a different shade of gray, or not gray, green.

453
0:29:11,980 --> 0:29:19,980
 You might have to tell it exactly what color green your green screen is.

454
0:29:19,980 --> 0:29:21,980
 But otherwise, just go with green.

455
0:29:21,980 --> 0:29:24,980
 And then you can experiment with these.

456
0:29:24,980 --> 0:29:27,980
 So now there's like nothing green behind me.

457
0:29:27,980 --> 0:29:30,980
 So it isn't working.

458
0:29:30,980 --> 0:29:40,980
 But what you need to do is you need to experiment a bit with similarity, smoothness, and spill reduction.

459
0:29:40,980 --> 0:29:48,980
 To make it fit your setup with your webcam, your lightning, the exact color of your green screen.

460
0:29:48,980 --> 0:29:53,980
 So that it actually removes the background.

461
0:29:53,980 --> 0:29:59,980
 But it doesn't remove all of you.

462
0:29:59,980 --> 0:30:02,980
 Or you don't get green hair unless you have that already.

463
0:30:02,980 --> 0:30:06,980
 If you have green hair already, green screen is a really bad idea.

464
0:30:06,980 --> 0:30:09,980
 Also, don't wear...

465
0:30:09,980 --> 0:30:13,980
 Green clothes.

466
0:30:13,980 --> 0:30:18,980
 Don't wear a multicolored scarf with green stuff.

467
0:30:18,980 --> 0:30:28,980
 Actually, I've had issues when I've been wearing this old Bornhack or Bornhack t-shirts with the green logo on them.

468
0:30:28,980 --> 0:30:32,980
 Then you can see it's a minor detail.

469
0:30:32,980 --> 0:30:34,980
 But then you'll suddenly see...

470
0:30:34,980 --> 0:30:37,980
 Then you become transparent where the logo is.

471
0:30:37,980 --> 0:30:39,980
 You can see the back...

472
0:30:39,980 --> 0:30:44,980
 Whatever is behind you in the layers here on the screen.

473
0:30:44,980 --> 0:30:49,980
 That they will appear through whatever green clothing you have on.

474
0:30:49,980 --> 0:30:50,980
 I still haven't...

475
0:30:50,980 --> 0:30:57,980
 I need to get like a long-sleeved green roller neck sweater to play around with.

476
0:30:57,980 --> 0:30:59,980
 I haven't gotten to that.

477
0:30:59,980 --> 0:31:01,980
 But I think that would be fun.

478
0:31:01,980 --> 0:31:03,980
 So you could be a talking head?

479
0:31:03,980 --> 0:31:04,980
 Exactly.

480
0:31:04,980 --> 0:31:06,980
 Then I can become totally a talking head.

481
0:31:07,980 --> 0:31:10,980
 In the middle of the screen.

482
0:31:10,980 --> 0:31:13,980
 And also need some green gloves.

483
0:31:13,980 --> 0:31:21,980
 I had an issue once where I did a webinar where I needed to talk about...

484
0:31:21,980 --> 0:31:27,980
 That was on horse training where I needed to talk about like comfort zone or zone of development or zone of danger.

485
0:31:27,980 --> 0:31:31,980
 So like where you are, are you comfortable or are you...

486
0:31:31,980 --> 0:31:36,980
 It's a bit exciting or a bit too interesting but it's still okay.

487
0:31:36,980 --> 0:31:38,980
 Or is it feeling like really dangerous?

488
0:31:38,980 --> 0:31:40,980
 And I had three pieces of paper.

489
0:31:40,980 --> 0:31:42,980
 A green, a yellow and a red.

490
0:31:42,980 --> 0:31:47,980
 And whenever I hold up the green piece of paper, it just disappeared and showed the background.

491
0:31:47,980 --> 0:31:50,980
 I was like, oh, I need to do something else about this.

492
0:31:50,980 --> 0:31:54,980
 I had to figure out a way to actually...

493
0:31:54,980 --> 0:31:57,980
 I think I found a very different shade of green paper.

494
0:31:57,980 --> 0:31:59,980
 And then it kind of worked.

495
0:31:59,980 --> 0:32:05,980
 But you have to think about what you're doing when you're using green screen like this.

496
0:32:05,980 --> 0:32:09,980
 Because it actually filters out anything green.

497
0:32:09,980 --> 0:32:12,980
 So...

498
0:32:12,980 --> 0:32:16,980
 But that will give some interesting effects sometimes.

499
0:32:16,980 --> 0:32:20,980
 But it is pretty easy to just put this in.

500
0:32:20,980 --> 0:32:25,980
 Also, if I wanted to have maybe that...

501
0:32:25,980 --> 0:32:29,980
 Okay, now I wanted to use the 16.9.

502
0:32:29,980 --> 0:32:33,980
 And not the 4.3 output of my webcam.

503
0:32:33,980 --> 0:32:35,980
 But I want to just cut a wee bit off.

504
0:32:35,980 --> 0:32:36,980
 And the sides.

505
0:32:36,980 --> 0:32:42,980
 I could put in another filter as well.

506
0:32:42,980 --> 0:32:45,980
 I think...

507
0:32:45,980 --> 0:32:48,980
 Yeah, that's like a crop.

508
0:32:48,980 --> 0:32:51,980
 So I could say...

509
0:32:51,980 --> 0:32:53,980
 Like...

510
0:32:53,980 --> 0:32:55,980
 We just call that crop.

511
0:32:55,980 --> 0:33:02,980
 And then I can say, okay, so on the left, I want to crop 100 pixels.

512
0:33:02,980 --> 0:33:05,980
 And on the right, I want to crop 100 pixels.

513
0:33:05,980 --> 0:33:09,980
 There it goes.

514
0:33:09,980 --> 0:33:12,980
 If I for some reason wanted to do that.

515
0:33:12,980 --> 0:33:14,980
 So now my input is smaller.

516
0:33:14,980 --> 0:33:16,980
 And then maybe I want to turn it to the side.

517
0:33:16,980 --> 0:33:17,980
 Maybe I want to put it in the middle.

518
0:33:17,980 --> 0:33:18,980
 Whatever.

519
0:33:18,980 --> 0:33:27,980
 But I have put like a bit of cropping on the sides without altering the input format.

520
0:33:27,980 --> 0:33:28,980
 So that can also be helpful.

521
0:33:28,980 --> 0:33:34,980
 That can also be helpful if like you have your webcam put in a position where it...

522
0:33:35,980 --> 0:33:40,980
 Of course, if you need the entire width of the webcam, that's not a good solution.

523
0:33:40,980 --> 0:33:48,980
 But like if you have a corner that will always be shown on your webcam where your green screen isn't covering or something like that,

524
0:33:48,980 --> 0:33:53,980
 you can just crop that out without actually having to alter the resolution.

525
0:33:57,980 --> 0:34:04,980
 So now if I say I have this, I want to now do my live presentation or something like that.

526
0:34:05,980 --> 0:34:08,980
 Then I'll have to set up some streaming.

527
0:34:08,980 --> 0:34:14,980
 And I do that by going here to Tools, I think.

528
0:34:14,980 --> 0:34:15,980
 No.

529
0:34:18,980 --> 0:34:19,980
 Settings.

530
0:34:19,980 --> 0:34:20,980
 Here.

531
0:34:20,980 --> 0:34:21,980
 Under File, we have Settings.

532
0:34:24,980 --> 0:34:25,980
 And then I have like...

533
0:34:25,980 --> 0:34:27,980
 There's like a ton of settings.

534
0:34:27,980 --> 0:34:28,980
 And it's...

535
0:34:31,980 --> 0:34:35,980
 You basically start with the default settings.

536
0:34:35,980 --> 0:34:37,980
 And then see where that takes you.

537
0:34:37,980 --> 0:34:43,980
 One of the things I really, really also like about using OBS, that is because it's open source,

538
0:34:43,980 --> 0:34:50,980
 it has so many users and there's like a ton of videos on YouTube about using OBS.

539
0:34:50,980 --> 0:34:55,980
 So if you find a function and you're a bit like, hmm, how should I do that?

540
0:34:55,980 --> 0:34:56,980
 Go Google.

541
0:34:56,980 --> 0:34:58,980
 Find a video on YouTube.

542
0:34:58,980 --> 0:35:01,980
 See what people say.

543
0:35:01,980 --> 0:35:04,980
 Check out a different couple of videos to see who...

544
0:35:04,980 --> 0:35:08,980
 Is saying something sensible.

545
0:35:08,980 --> 0:35:15,980
 Because it's usually very easy to find information on whatever it is you need.

546
0:35:15,980 --> 0:35:20,980
 That also means if you have some sort of issue, there's someone, probably someone who already had that.

547
0:35:20,980 --> 0:35:25,980
 If you have an issue with a specific webcam that isn't working or something like that,

548
0:35:25,980 --> 0:35:31,980
 there's a good chance that someone else has already had that problem and have solved it.

549
0:35:31,980 --> 0:35:33,980
 So I really like that.

550
0:35:34,980 --> 0:35:42,980
 And also because it is a program that is widely used, there's a lot of development going on.

551
0:35:42,980 --> 0:35:45,980
 So there's continuously coming new versions.

552
0:35:45,980 --> 0:35:49,980
 But what we wanted to look at is, we might look at the output first.

553
0:35:49,980 --> 0:35:56,980
 Because if I want to do a recording, I want to make sure that I'm actually recording in the format that I would like.

554
0:35:58,980 --> 0:36:03,980
 So I say, yes, we want the encoder to be 264.

555
0:36:03,980 --> 0:36:06,980
 That makes sense.

556
0:36:06,980 --> 0:36:10,980
 Something about the audio bitrate, that's probably okay.

557
0:36:10,980 --> 0:36:20,980
 We can turn on some advanced encoder settings, but usually that's not necessary.

558
0:36:20,980 --> 0:36:24,980
 And we can say, what is the recording quality?

559
0:36:24,980 --> 0:36:27,980
 Same as stream, that's usually recommended.

560
0:36:27,980 --> 0:36:32,980
 Because if the computer needs to...

561
0:36:32,980 --> 0:36:39,980
 both create a stream in one resolution and a video output in another resolution, it has to work harder.

562
0:36:39,980 --> 0:36:43,980
 If you have a big computer with a lot of resources, that's not a problem.

563
0:36:43,980 --> 0:36:53,980
 If you're working on a laptop, then maybe you need to do that.

564
0:36:53,980 --> 0:37:01,980
 Actually it says here, recordings cannot be paused if the recording quality is set to same as stream.

565
0:37:01,980 --> 0:37:03,980
 Yeah, that kind of makes sense.

566
0:37:03,980 --> 0:37:07,980
 There's now, that wasn't when I started, but now there is a pause function.

567
0:37:07,980 --> 0:37:15,980
 So if you're doing something and then you hit a snag and you need to investigate something,

568
0:37:15,980 --> 0:37:19,980
 that happens a lot when I do videos.

569
0:37:19,980 --> 0:37:24,980
 It's like when you sit with a live piece of software and you demo that,

570
0:37:24,980 --> 0:37:27,980
 there might be something weird going on sometimes.

571
0:37:27,980 --> 0:37:30,980
 So sometimes, if I'm like five minutes into a video,

572
0:37:31,980 --> 0:37:34,980
 and I've been demoing some new feature or something like that,

573
0:37:34,980 --> 0:37:37,980
 and then something unexpected happens,

574
0:37:37,980 --> 0:37:40,980
 what I do instead of having to start over is I say,

575
0:37:40,980 --> 0:37:42,980
 I'll just, just a second, I'll investigate this,

576
0:37:42,980 --> 0:37:45,980
 and then I hit the pause button, that's if I'm not live,

577
0:37:45,980 --> 0:37:47,980
 then I hit the pause button,

578
0:37:47,980 --> 0:37:51,980
 and then I can go investigate and figure out,

579
0:37:51,980 --> 0:37:53,980
 have I misunderstood this feature?

580
0:37:53,980 --> 0:37:55,980
 Do we have a bug?

581
0:37:55,980 --> 0:37:59,980
 Is this doing what it's actually supposed to do?

582
0:37:59,980 --> 0:38:01,980
 Did I just click something wrong?

583
0:38:01,980 --> 0:38:02,980
 What happened?

584
0:38:02,980 --> 0:38:05,980
 And then I can go back to OBS and my screen share,

585
0:38:05,980 --> 0:38:07,980
 and I can pick up where I left, and I can say,

586
0:38:07,980 --> 0:38:11,980
 okay, so what we need to do is this, this, this,

587
0:38:11,980 --> 0:38:15,980
 again, instead of having to restart the recording

588
0:38:15,980 --> 0:38:17,980
 and start from the beginning.

589
0:38:25,980 --> 0:38:29,980
 Recording format, it defaults to Matroska,

590
0:38:29,980 --> 0:38:31,980
 which usually works really, really well.

591
0:38:31,980 --> 0:38:36,980
 There's also audio settings, video settings.

592
0:38:36,980 --> 0:38:43,980
 So we have, like, the canvas resolution,

593
0:38:43,980 --> 0:38:45,980
 and then we have the output resolution.

594
0:38:45,980 --> 0:38:48,980
 So the canvas resolution, that's what we are working on

595
0:38:48,980 --> 0:38:51,980
 in the program or preview,

596
0:38:51,980 --> 0:38:55,980
 and then we have the output scale resolution,

597
0:38:55,980 --> 0:38:58,980
 and we need to have the, you can see here,

598
0:38:58,980 --> 0:39:00,980
 like, the aspect ratio on the canvas,

599
0:39:00,980 --> 0:39:04,980
 is 1600 to 899.

600
0:39:04,980 --> 0:39:10,980
 That's, like, as close to 16.9 as you'll get, right?

601
0:39:10,980 --> 0:39:14,980
 I'm not really sure what happened to the last pixel here

602
0:39:14,980 --> 0:39:21,980
 since it's not 1600 by 900, but hey.

603
0:39:21,980 --> 0:39:24,980
 Yeah, we have a question there.

604
0:39:24,980 --> 0:39:28,980
 Can you hand him to me?

605
0:39:28,980 --> 0:39:31,980
 Then I'll just grab a bit of water.

606
0:39:33,980 --> 0:39:35,980
 And I need to hurry up.

607
0:39:35,980 --> 0:39:38,980
 What's the point of having a canvas bigger

608
0:39:38,980 --> 0:39:41,980
 than what we are going to actually output to,

609
0:39:41,980 --> 0:39:44,980
 because scaling might get lost?

610
0:39:44,980 --> 0:39:45,980
 Yeah, yeah.

611
0:39:45,980 --> 0:39:47,980
 You are absolutely right.

612
0:39:47,980 --> 0:39:49,980
 Usually I would also, I'm not quite sure

613
0:39:49,980 --> 0:39:51,980
 why it has default to the 1600.

614
0:39:51,980 --> 0:39:56,980
 I would usually make those the same because it's annoying.

615
0:39:56,980 --> 0:40:03,980
 And I would usually set this to 1080 for output

616
0:40:03,980 --> 0:40:08,980
 because then I get, like, the maximum quality on my videos.

617
0:40:08,980 --> 0:40:13,980
 One of the things you need to be aware of

618
0:40:13,980 --> 0:40:18,980
 if you're screen sharing is that if you're using, like, 1080

619
0:40:18,980 --> 0:40:21,980
 and people are maybe watching it on their phones

620
0:40:21,980 --> 0:40:25,980
 or on a smaller screen size, then things will become, like,

621
0:40:25,980 --> 0:40:28,980
 rather tiny where they are looking, like, nice and sharp

622
0:40:28,980 --> 0:40:32,980
 on your big screen than you can in your browser

623
0:40:32,980 --> 0:40:34,980
 when you're visiting any page.

624
0:40:34,980 --> 0:40:37,980
 Now I have, like, a really crappy resolution here.

625
0:40:37,980 --> 0:40:41,980
 But if you just, if you're on a page that you want to screen share

626
0:40:41,980 --> 0:40:43,980
 and you are working in a high resolution

627
0:40:43,980 --> 0:40:46,980
 and you want your audience to have a chance

628
0:40:46,980 --> 0:40:48,980
 to actually pick up on what you're doing,

629
0:40:48,980 --> 0:40:50,980
 you can use control and plus.

630
0:40:50,980 --> 0:40:54,980
 And I usually run on 125% zoom.

631
0:40:54,980 --> 0:40:57,980
 Because that actually makes it a lot easier

632
0:40:57,980 --> 0:40:59,980
 for my audience to see what's going on

633
0:40:59,980 --> 0:41:02,980
 if they're sitting on a smaller screen than me.

634
0:41:02,980 --> 0:41:05,980
 And I can keep the high resolution quality

635
0:41:05,980 --> 0:41:08,980
 on the videos, on the webcam, on everything.

636
0:41:08,980 --> 0:41:11,980
 I kind of like that.

637
0:41:11,980 --> 0:41:13,980
 Yeah, we have another question there.

638
0:41:13,980 --> 0:41:17,980
 So this is also regarding the base canvas resolution

639
0:41:17,980 --> 0:41:19,980
 and the output scaled resolution.

640
0:41:19,980 --> 0:41:21,980
 So, for example, I'm doing a broadcast

641
0:41:21,980 --> 0:41:23,980
 or recording on my computer,

642
0:41:23,980 --> 0:41:25,980
 but my computer has a 4K screen.

643
0:41:25,980 --> 0:41:28,980
 Here is where I can choose, hey, what people see is just 1080p?

644
0:41:28,980 --> 0:41:29,980
 Yeah.

645
0:41:29,980 --> 0:41:30,980
 And it does the downscaling?

646
0:41:30,980 --> 0:41:31,980
 Yeah.

647
0:41:31,980 --> 0:41:32,980
 Okay.

648
0:41:32,980 --> 0:41:34,980
 And I saw there's also a recording option.

649
0:41:34,980 --> 0:41:36,980
 Then the recording is also the downscaled version.

650
0:41:36,980 --> 0:41:37,980
 Yeah.

651
0:41:37,980 --> 0:41:38,980
 Okay.

652
0:41:38,980 --> 0:41:39,980
 Yeah.

653
0:41:39,980 --> 0:41:41,980
 Thank you.

654
0:41:41,980 --> 0:41:43,980
 And that's a good point.

655
0:41:43,980 --> 0:41:45,980
 So, and also, if you're using, like,

656
0:41:45,980 --> 0:41:47,980
 if you're using background images,

657
0:41:47,980 --> 0:41:50,980
 it's a really good idea that whatever background image

658
0:41:50,980 --> 0:41:52,980
 you're using is actually

659
0:41:52,980 --> 0:41:54,980
 your canvas size.

660
0:41:54,980 --> 0:41:58,980
 So if I have a 1600 by 900 canvas size,

661
0:41:58,980 --> 0:42:01,980
 I should make my background images that size

662
0:42:01,980 --> 0:42:03,980
 because then I don't have to scale them.

663
0:42:03,980 --> 0:42:06,980
 Then I'll get a better quality.

664
0:42:06,980 --> 0:42:10,980
 So that's good to keep in mind.

665
0:42:10,980 --> 0:42:12,980
 The last thing I wanted to show you

666
0:42:12,980 --> 0:42:15,980
 before we have time for a few questions more,

667
0:42:15,980 --> 0:42:17,980
 that's, like, the stream.

668
0:42:17,980 --> 0:42:20,980
 You just go to the stream here,

669
0:42:20,980 --> 0:42:22,980
 and then you choose whatever services

670
0:42:22,980 --> 0:42:26,980
 they have some predefined sources you can use.

671
0:42:26,980 --> 0:42:30,980
 I found out that choosing Facebook Live

672
0:42:30,980 --> 0:42:33,980
 actually doesn't work.

673
0:42:33,980 --> 0:42:37,980
 I usually need to say custom,

674
0:42:37,980 --> 0:42:39,980
 not Twitch, custom.

675
0:42:39,980 --> 0:42:40,980
 There it goes.

676
0:42:40,980 --> 0:42:43,980
 And then I, from my Facebook,

677
0:42:43,980 --> 0:42:45,980
 it tells me the server,

678
0:42:45,980 --> 0:42:47,980
 and it tells me the stream key.

679
0:42:47,980 --> 0:42:50,980
 And in Facebook, I can set up so that I have

680
0:42:50,980 --> 0:42:52,980
 for the same Facebook,

681
0:42:52,980 --> 0:42:55,980
 I have a recurring stream key,

682
0:42:55,980 --> 0:42:57,980
 so I don't have to go into OBS every time

683
0:42:57,980 --> 0:42:59,980
 and change the stream key.

684
0:42:59,980 --> 0:43:01,980
 That is, of course, less secure.

685
0:43:01,980 --> 0:43:04,980
 If someone should obtain my stream key,

686
0:43:04,980 --> 0:43:07,980
 they can now stream to my Facebook groups.

687
0:43:07,980 --> 0:43:11,980
 But the risk of that happening is not, like, enormous.

688
0:43:11,980 --> 0:43:14,980
 And if it happens, I can go and reset my stream key.

689
0:43:14,980 --> 0:43:17,980
 But you, of course, need to be aware

690
0:43:17,980 --> 0:43:20,980
 that that's the risk of reusing stream keys.

691
0:43:20,980 --> 0:43:21,980
 But it's a lot easier.

692
0:43:21,980 --> 0:43:23,980
 You don't have to go into OBS every time

693
0:43:23,980 --> 0:43:29,980
 and paste in the new stream key when you're going live.

694
0:43:29,980 --> 0:43:32,980
 There's also, you can program hotkeys,

695
0:43:32,980 --> 0:43:38,980
 and there's other settings.

696
0:43:38,980 --> 0:43:43,980
 But basically, this is OBS.

697
0:43:43,980 --> 0:43:49,980
 This is my Swiss Army knife for video production.

698
0:43:49,980 --> 0:43:50,980
 I love working in it.

699
0:43:50,980 --> 0:43:52,980
 It saves me, I have no idea,

700
0:43:52,980 --> 0:43:56,980
 over the last, now, four and a half years,

701
0:43:56,980 --> 0:44:01,980
 how many hours of editing work this has saved me.

702
0:44:01,980 --> 0:44:04,980
 I just love that I can get an idea to a video,

703
0:44:04,980 --> 0:44:07,980
 I can create the setup.

704
0:44:07,980 --> 0:44:10,980
 Usually, it's only like editing a small piece of text

705
0:44:10,980 --> 0:44:14,980
 or something like that in the scenes I already have.

706
0:44:14,980 --> 0:44:16,980
 I sit down, I click record,

707
0:44:16,980 --> 0:44:19,980
 I show whatever it is I want to show.

708
0:44:19,980 --> 0:44:21,980
 This could also be something to a client

709
0:44:21,980 --> 0:44:24,980
 if I need to tell them how to set up something specific

710
0:44:24,980 --> 0:44:26,980
 in their Simplero account.

711
0:44:26,980 --> 0:44:28,980
 I go into their Simplero account.

712
0:44:28,980 --> 0:44:30,980
 I do a short recording with OBS.

713
0:44:30,980 --> 0:44:32,980
 I upload it to their account.

714
0:44:32,980 --> 0:44:33,980
 I send them an email and say,

715
0:44:33,980 --> 0:44:35,980
 hey, here's the video.

716
0:44:35,980 --> 0:44:36,980
 And I don't need to do any,

717
0:44:36,980 --> 0:44:40,980
 after processing, the Matruska video is just ready to use

718
0:44:40,980 --> 0:44:43,980
 as soon as I hit stop recording on OBS.

719
0:44:43,980 --> 0:44:45,980
 I love it.

720
0:44:45,980 --> 0:44:46,980
 It's fantastic.

721
0:44:46,980 --> 0:44:47,980
 Yeah?

722
0:44:47,980 --> 0:44:48,980
 Any questions?

723
0:44:49,980 --> 0:44:59,980
 Hello again.

724
0:44:59,980 --> 0:45:03,980
 So the question I have is I use,

725
0:45:03,980 --> 0:45:05,980
 I personally use a fork of OBS,

726
0:45:05,980 --> 0:45:08,980
 but I'm considering using OBS itself

727
0:45:08,980 --> 0:45:11,980
 because it's well maintained.

728
0:45:11,980 --> 0:45:14,980
 The software I use is also an older version

729
0:45:14,980 --> 0:45:16,980
 and I only have a single screen.

730
0:45:16,980 --> 0:45:18,980
 And you early showed you have a studio mode

731
0:45:18,980 --> 0:45:21,980
 and a single mode screen thingy.

732
0:45:21,980 --> 0:45:22,980
 Yeah.

733
0:45:22,980 --> 0:45:24,980
 So studio mode is just switching between

734
0:45:24,980 --> 0:45:26,980
 showing like two,

735
0:45:26,980 --> 0:45:28,980
 both the preview and the program

736
0:45:28,980 --> 0:45:30,980
 or only having...

737
0:45:30,980 --> 0:45:31,980
 Yeah.

738
0:45:31,980 --> 0:45:33,980
 So mine looks like this.

739
0:45:33,980 --> 0:45:36,980
 And when you were doing your talk in studio mode,

740
0:45:36,980 --> 0:45:38,980
 I saw when you were building scenes,

741
0:45:38,980 --> 0:45:41,980
 you can just play around in the scene,

742
0:45:41,980 --> 0:45:43,980
 adding sources.

743
0:45:43,980 --> 0:45:46,980
 And on the right side for us,

744
0:45:46,980 --> 0:45:48,980
 that is what is live.

745
0:45:48,980 --> 0:45:50,980
 And then the left side is...

746
0:45:50,980 --> 0:45:53,980
 The left side is always preview.

747
0:45:53,980 --> 0:45:55,980
 And the right side is always live.

748
0:45:55,980 --> 0:45:57,980
 How do you push the preview to the live?

749
0:45:57,980 --> 0:45:58,980
 Yeah.

750
0:45:58,980 --> 0:45:59,980
 Then I just hit transition

751
0:45:59,980 --> 0:46:01,980
 and then I switch to the new scene.

752
0:46:01,980 --> 0:46:02,980
 Yeah.

753
0:46:02,980 --> 0:46:03,980
 Because for example,

754
0:46:03,980 --> 0:46:05,980
 when I do a broadcast or at work,

755
0:46:05,980 --> 0:46:06,980
 I need to present something.

756
0:46:06,980 --> 0:46:07,980
 Sometimes they ask something,

757
0:46:07,980 --> 0:46:09,980
 I need to pull in a terminal.

758
0:46:09,980 --> 0:46:10,980
 Yeah.

759
0:46:10,980 --> 0:46:13,980
 Or maybe I need a scene with a terminal in it.

760
0:46:13,980 --> 0:46:14,980
 But I was just wondering with this mode,

761
0:46:14,980 --> 0:46:17,980
 I can check for myself something first

762
0:46:17,980 --> 0:46:18,980
 and then push it to live?

763
0:46:18,980 --> 0:46:20,980
 And then press it to program.

764
0:46:20,980 --> 0:46:21,980
 Push it to program.

765
0:46:21,980 --> 0:46:22,980
 Yeah.

766
0:46:22,980 --> 0:46:23,980
 Thank you.

767
0:46:23,980 --> 0:46:24,980
 Yeah.

768
0:46:27,980 --> 0:46:30,980
 And you said there were virtual webcams.

769
0:46:30,980 --> 0:46:31,980
 Yeah.

770
0:46:31,980 --> 0:46:33,980
 Is that you can designate pretty much any...

771
0:46:33,980 --> 0:46:36,980
 The video output of any app,

772
0:46:36,980 --> 0:46:40,980
 of any window that is running on your machine,

773
0:46:40,980 --> 0:46:43,980
 you can designate that to be a virtual webcam?

774
0:46:43,980 --> 0:46:44,980
 Yeah.

775
0:46:44,980 --> 0:46:47,980
 Because then whatever is running in program

776
0:46:47,980 --> 0:46:50,980
 will then be shown on the virtual webcam.

777
0:46:50,980 --> 0:46:52,980
 Ah, I see.

778
0:46:52,980 --> 0:46:55,980
 It's a pretty cool feature.

779
0:46:55,980 --> 0:46:56,980
 For a long while,

780
0:46:56,980 --> 0:46:58,980
 it was like a special plugin on Windows

781
0:46:58,980 --> 0:47:01,980
 where they had it on Linux,

782
0:47:01,980 --> 0:47:03,980
 where they had it on Windows and I also think Mac.

783
0:47:03,980 --> 0:47:06,980
 But now it's built in from the beginning.

784
0:47:09,980 --> 0:47:10,980
 Hi.

785
0:47:10,980 --> 0:47:11,980
 Hi.

786
0:47:11,980 --> 0:47:13,980
 I've heard that the Linux version of OBS

787
0:47:13,980 --> 0:47:17,980
 is more limited than the Windows version.

788
0:47:17,980 --> 0:47:19,980
 Is that still the case or...

789
0:47:19,980 --> 0:47:22,980
 I think so, yes.

790
0:47:22,980 --> 0:47:23,980
 It's still...

791
0:47:23,980 --> 0:47:27,980
 One of the specific example was the virtual webcam

792
0:47:27,980 --> 0:47:29,980
 where you needed a special plugin

793
0:47:29,980 --> 0:47:31,980
 that someone else had created for the Linux version.

794
0:47:31,980 --> 0:47:34,980
 That is now built in.

795
0:47:34,980 --> 0:47:37,980
 And there are some other limitations,

796
0:47:37,980 --> 0:47:38,980
 but it's...

797
0:47:38,980 --> 0:47:40,980
 I've been running this on Linux for four and a half years

798
0:47:40,980 --> 0:47:42,980
 and I'm happy, happy.

799
0:47:42,980 --> 0:47:45,980
 You can't remember any other limitations?

800
0:47:45,980 --> 0:47:46,980
 No, no.

801
0:47:46,980 --> 0:47:49,980
 I haven't met anything where I've been limited

802
0:47:49,980 --> 0:47:52,980
 and then what usually happens is

803
0:47:52,980 --> 0:47:54,980
 if I find something and I start Googling

804
0:47:54,980 --> 0:47:55,980
 and then they say,

805
0:47:55,980 --> 0:47:57,980
 hey, there's this function you blah, blah.

806
0:47:57,980 --> 0:47:59,980
 And then I see, oh, okay,

807
0:47:59,980 --> 0:48:00,980
 so that's like a Windows function

808
0:48:00,980 --> 0:48:01,980
 and then I Google a bit more

809
0:48:01,980 --> 0:48:02,980
 and then I find out, okay,

810
0:48:02,980 --> 0:48:04,980
 so that's not available on Linux yet.

811
0:48:04,980 --> 0:48:05,980
 But it's...

812
0:48:05,980 --> 0:48:07,980
 So far, the only thing I've seen

813
0:48:07,980 --> 0:48:10,980
 was the webcam, the virtual webcam function.

814
0:48:10,980 --> 0:48:11,980
 Okay, thank you.

815
0:48:11,980 --> 0:48:20,980
 Hello again.

816
0:48:20,980 --> 0:48:22,980
 So as I said, I do presentations at work,

817
0:48:22,980 --> 0:48:23,980
 you know, Monday meetings,

818
0:48:23,980 --> 0:48:25,980
 but I'm considering live streaming.

819
0:48:25,980 --> 0:48:26,980
 Yeah.

820
0:48:26,980 --> 0:48:29,980
 I'm not sure what I'm going to do yet.

821
0:48:29,980 --> 0:48:30,980
 Earlier in the settings,

822
0:48:30,980 --> 0:48:33,980
 you were scrolling through like the video and audio

823
0:48:33,980 --> 0:48:35,980
 and I saw shortcuts.

824
0:48:35,980 --> 0:48:37,980
 When you're recording for yourself

825
0:48:37,980 --> 0:48:39,980
 or doing a presentation,

826
0:48:39,980 --> 0:48:41,980
 do you use any shortcuts?

827
0:48:41,980 --> 0:48:43,980
 For like scene changing?

828
0:48:43,980 --> 0:48:44,980
 I do that.

829
0:48:44,980 --> 0:48:47,980
 If I use more than two or three scenes,

830
0:48:47,980 --> 0:48:50,980
 I can put shortcuts on specific scenes

831
0:48:50,980 --> 0:48:52,980
 so that I know that if I hit F2

832
0:48:52,980 --> 0:48:53,980
 or something like that,

833
0:48:53,980 --> 0:48:55,980
 it will, in the preview,

834
0:48:55,980 --> 0:48:56,980
 switch to a specific scene

835
0:48:56,980 --> 0:48:58,980
 so I don't have to scroll and look for it.

836
0:48:58,980 --> 0:49:00,980
 I can just hit a button.

837
0:49:00,980 --> 0:49:01,980
 That was also what we had

838
0:49:01,980 --> 0:49:04,980
 on the video box set up here

839
0:49:04,980 --> 0:49:07,980
 way back when, when we used OBS.

840
0:49:07,980 --> 0:49:09,980
 And that works really nicely

841
0:49:09,980 --> 0:49:10,980
 because that's a big help.

842
0:49:10,980 --> 0:49:11,980
 If you have any questions,

843
0:49:11,980 --> 0:49:13,980
 we have many scenes you're switching between.

844
0:49:13,980 --> 0:49:14,980
 Okay.

845
0:49:14,980 --> 0:49:17,980
 And I'll assume that all the shortcuts

846
0:49:17,980 --> 0:49:20,980
 are defaulted in the application

847
0:49:20,980 --> 0:49:22,980
 and you don't need to add yourself

848
0:49:22,980 --> 0:49:25,980
 because when I was researching a week ago

849
0:49:25,980 --> 0:49:26,980
 when I looked on YouTube

850
0:49:26,980 --> 0:49:28,980
 to some reviews about OBS,

851
0:49:28,980 --> 0:49:31,980
 they all, most of them suggested

852
0:49:31,980 --> 0:49:32,980
 to get one of these devices

853
0:49:32,980 --> 0:49:34,980
 with like multiple buttons and so on.

854
0:49:34,980 --> 0:49:35,980
 Yeah.

855
0:49:35,980 --> 0:49:36,980
 But they're very pricey.

856
0:49:36,980 --> 0:49:39,980
 So I was wondering if everything is just doable

857
0:49:39,980 --> 0:49:40,980
 on just a regular keyboard

858
0:49:40,980 --> 0:49:42,980
 with your computer or on the laptop.

859
0:49:42,980 --> 0:49:44,980
 I actually can't remember.

860
0:49:44,980 --> 0:49:46,980
 Yeah, see, you have here like start streaming,

861
0:49:46,980 --> 0:49:47,980
 stop streaming.

862
0:49:47,980 --> 0:49:49,980
 You have keys for that

863
0:49:49,980 --> 0:49:51,980
 that you can put in.

864
0:49:51,980 --> 0:49:53,980
 I'm guessing then you just put in

865
0:49:53,980 --> 0:49:56,980
 the key combination you want.

866
0:49:56,980 --> 0:50:03,980
 But there's also a way to put

867
0:50:03,980 --> 0:50:07,980
 key shortcuts on your specific scenes.

868
0:50:07,980 --> 0:50:09,980
 I just can't remember how.

869
0:50:10,980 --> 0:50:14,980
 Okay, so let's try this.

870
0:50:14,980 --> 0:50:16,980
 I have to put in this.

871
0:50:25,980 --> 0:50:27,980
 I can't remember how you do that,

872
0:50:27,980 --> 0:50:28,980
 but there's a way to do it.

873
0:50:28,980 --> 0:50:31,980
 You can bind a shortcut to a specific scene?

874
0:50:31,980 --> 0:50:33,980
 Yeah, there's a way to do that

875
0:50:33,980 --> 0:50:36,980
 but I just can't remember right now how you do that.

876
0:50:36,980 --> 0:50:37,980
 Thank you.

877
0:50:37,980 --> 0:50:38,980
 It's there.

878
0:50:40,980 --> 0:50:50,240
 The green screen function, does it have to be green or can you designate pretty much

879
0:50:50,240 --> 0:50:52,000
 any color to be the back?

880
0:50:52,000 --> 0:50:57,280
 You can use other colors and you can tell OBS exactly what color you have.

881
0:50:57,280 --> 0:51:03,120
 Some colors work better than others and you also have to consider, but like if your brand

882
0:51:03,120 --> 0:51:07,520
 colors are green and you're wearing a lot of green, you need to figure out another color

883
0:51:07,520 --> 0:51:12,260
 because otherwise everything will be very weird.

884
0:51:12,260 --> 0:51:13,800
 So you can do other colors.

885
0:51:13,800 --> 0:51:18,420
 Blue is another traditional color for, then it's blue screen instead of green screen.

886
0:51:18,420 --> 0:51:19,420
 That also works really well.

887
0:51:19,420 --> 0:51:23,280
 So it works better if it's a primary color?

888
0:51:23,280 --> 0:51:24,280
 Yeah.

889
0:51:24,280 --> 0:51:29,880
 So you just need to, and you can, in the chroma key settings, you can specify the color of

890
0:51:29,880 --> 0:51:31,760
 your green screen.

891
0:51:31,760 --> 0:51:32,760
 Yeah.

892
0:51:32,760 --> 0:51:35,760
 Any more questions?

893
0:51:35,760 --> 0:51:36,760
 No?

894
0:51:36,760 --> 0:51:37,520
 Okay.

895
0:51:37,520 --> 0:51:43,420
 So if you get any questions, then you're welcome to stop me on the street here and

896
0:51:43,420 --> 0:51:47,240
 say hi or send me an email or anything.

897
0:51:47,240 --> 0:51:51,160
 I'll be happy to answer your questions.

898
0:51:51,160 --> 0:51:54,160
 Please give a big round of applause to Arete.

899
0:51:54,160 --> 0:51:55,160
 Thank you.

900
0:51:55,160 --> 0:51:56,160
 Thank you.
