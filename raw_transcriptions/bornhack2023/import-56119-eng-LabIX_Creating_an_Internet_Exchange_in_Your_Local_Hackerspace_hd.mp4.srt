0:00:00,000 --> 0:00:11,560
 To find information on how an internet exchange operates, there is some information that is

2
0:00:11,560 --> 0:00:16,860
 a very high level and doesn't really explain too much.

3
0:00:16,860 --> 0:00:21,960
 And then there is also the administration of talking to RIPE and what objects do you

4
0:00:21,960 --> 0:00:26,600
 need and how do you get IP addresses and stuff like that.

5
0:00:26,600 --> 0:00:31,620
 There's many policies included, and yes, I wrote everything as an acronym soup because

6
0:00:31,620 --> 0:00:35,040
 that's pretty much what it is.

7
0:00:35,040 --> 0:00:41,260
 So Labix is a community-run internet exchange.

8
0:00:41,260 --> 0:00:49,680
 We made this because I like BGP and network routing, and I would like to play more with

9
0:00:49,680 --> 0:00:51,020
 it.

10
0:00:51,020 --> 0:00:54,860
 So in Labasat we have a facility called Labicolo.

11
0:00:54,860 --> 0:00:56,540
 We will get more into that.

12
0:00:56,540 --> 0:00:58,200
 At some point.

13
0:00:58,200 --> 0:01:04,320
 But we offer a service called a route server.

14
0:01:04,320 --> 0:01:06,880
 Again I will get more into it.

15
0:01:06,880 --> 0:01:17,120
 What that is, we can assist you in how should you talk to a local internet registry to get

16
0:01:17,120 --> 0:01:19,680
 an AS number and IP addresses.

17
0:01:19,680 --> 0:01:24,860
 You can actually start looking into real network routing stuff and not just play with it in

18
0:01:24,860 --> 0:01:26,540
 a virtual machine.

19
0:01:26,540 --> 0:01:37,200
 You can do BGP stuff, BGP security, and research and build on what is RPKI and things like this.

20
0:01:37,200 --> 0:01:44,400
 Also, yes, I wrote 9KM2, we don't have that currently, but we will very soon set that

21
0:01:44,400 --> 0:01:45,400
 up to 9KM2.

22
0:01:45,400 --> 0:01:49,620
 It's currently 1,500, like most.

23
0:01:49,620 --> 0:01:51,200
 So what is an internet exchange?

24
0:01:51,200 --> 0:01:53,200
 Well, it's a very simple way.

25
0:01:53,200 --> 0:01:54,200
 It's a VLAN on a little switch.

26
0:01:54,200 --> 0:01:55,200
 It's a very simple way.

27
0:01:55,200 --> 0:01:56,200
 It's a VLAN on a little switch.

28
0:01:56,200 --> 0:02:00,320
 And then some networks are connected to it.

29
0:02:00,320 --> 0:02:03,500
 Well, that doesn't really say much.

30
0:02:03,500 --> 0:02:07,020
 So let me explain what is the internet.

31
0:02:07,020 --> 0:02:14,760
 First, this is how you do it, how to do internet routing or network routing.

32
0:02:14,760 --> 0:02:15,760
 We have some prefixes.

33
0:02:15,760 --> 0:02:20,160
 You find a facility that would like to host you, that includes some power and cooling

34
0:02:20,160 --> 0:02:22,260
 and stuff like that.

35
0:02:22,260 --> 0:02:23,260
 You install your machines.

36
0:02:23,260 --> 0:02:24,260
 You set up a routing daemon.

37
0:02:24,260 --> 0:02:25,260
 There could be like a bird.

38
0:02:25,260 --> 0:02:26,200
 If you do that, it's a bird.

39
0:02:26,200 --> 0:02:30,700
 You can use Linux or other things.

40
0:02:30,700 --> 0:02:37,120
 Then you have some peers that are operating network operators.

41
0:02:37,120 --> 0:02:40,660
 And you will peer with them to get their content.

42
0:02:40,660 --> 0:02:47,860
 And then you also need a transit uplink, which is how do you, well, now you're in like facility

43
0:02:47,860 --> 0:02:52,120
 with, and you can connect with the other people in that facility, but how do you connect with

44
0:02:52,120 --> 0:02:53,120
 the rest of the world?

45
0:02:53,120 --> 0:02:54,120
 We're not Copenhagen.

46
0:02:54,120 --> 0:02:55,200
 It's just, it doesn't contain the whole network.

47
0:02:55,200 --> 0:02:56,200
 Yeah.

48
0:02:56,200 --> 0:02:58,020
 It's just the whole internet.

49
0:02:58,020 --> 0:03:06,920
 So you need a transit that says we will like to transport the traffic from your network

50
0:03:06,920 --> 0:03:11,780
 over to the destination and profit, I guess.

51
0:03:11,780 --> 0:03:15,140
 So let's set a scenario.

52
0:03:15,140 --> 0:03:16,520
 You want Eyeball ISP.

53
0:03:16,520 --> 0:03:24,700
 You are currently located in Hyggedam, coincidentally where we are, and an Eyeball ISP is that we

54
0:03:24,700 --> 0:03:25,700
 have some customers.

55
0:03:25,700 --> 0:03:33,520
 And Eyeballs, they consume content that could be watching their favorite series or watching

56
0:03:33,520 --> 0:03:37,940
 the news or somehow get content.

57
0:03:37,940 --> 0:03:42,120
 You don't host servers necessarily.

58
0:03:42,120 --> 0:03:54,060
 So for you to be able to have, to say, like when a customer wants to, when a customer

59
0:03:54,060 --> 0:03:55,060
 wants to...

60
0:03:55,060 --> 0:04:01,120
 Connect to another provider to get content, you need some IP addresses.

61
0:04:01,120 --> 0:04:07,380
 That is, well, hopefully most of you know, some is like an address, like a postal address

62
0:04:07,380 --> 0:04:09,720
 where I do the thing you need to go.

63
0:04:09,720 --> 0:04:13,820
 You also need that for your servers.

64
0:04:13,820 --> 0:04:18,260
 Then yeah, you need housing and fiber stuff.

65
0:04:18,260 --> 0:04:22,300
 I won't go into the fiber stuff.

66
0:04:22,300 --> 0:04:24,880
 I don't dig too much into layer one things.

67
0:04:24,880 --> 0:04:28,740
 Layer three, in this case.

68
0:04:28,740 --> 0:04:35,160
 So how does the network connect with other networks?

69
0:04:35,160 --> 0:04:38,300
 You probably cannot see my mouse.

70
0:04:38,300 --> 0:04:44,640
 So we have in the left, it's called, well, in this case, it's called Acme.

71
0:04:44,640 --> 0:04:46,440
 This is one network provider.

72
0:04:46,440 --> 0:04:52,540
 What if Acme is, Acme one and Acme two are not located in the same city and the same

73
0:04:52,540 --> 0:04:53,540
 facility?

74
0:04:53,540 --> 0:04:54,540
 Well.

75
0:04:54,540 --> 0:04:59,000
 So in our lovely picture here, we can have, we have two transit providers that need to

76
0:04:59,000 --> 0:05:02,360
 go through first.

77
0:05:02,360 --> 0:05:08,800
 So says Comcast and say DDT, which are some providers in the world that exist.

78
0:05:08,800 --> 0:05:12,020
 And then we can go into Acme number two.

79
0:05:12,020 --> 0:05:21,980
 That could be where all the nice services are hosted or similar.

80
0:05:21,980 --> 0:05:23,540
 It could also be that.

81
0:05:23,540 --> 0:05:24,540
 What if Acme one is not located in the same city and the same facility?

82
0:05:24,540 --> 0:05:30,760
 Well, Acme one and Acme two are located in the same city, they're just not really connected.

83
0:05:30,760 --> 0:05:33,460
 And it would be perhaps too expensive to connect them.

84
0:05:33,460 --> 0:05:37,100
 So let's look at what is an autonomous system.

85
0:05:37,100 --> 0:05:43,720
 It says AS one and AS two here, AS something, something, something in other ones.

86
0:05:43,720 --> 0:05:51,660
 So we have a lovely RFC that describes AS as a connected group of one or more prefixes

87
0:05:51,660 --> 0:05:53,360
 run by one or more network operators.

88
0:05:53,360 --> 0:05:54,360
 Which has a set of prefixes.

89
0:05:54,360 --> 0:05:58,780
 Has a single and clearly defined routing policy.

90
0:05:58,780 --> 0:06:00,980
 I can explain a tiny bit more on that.

91
0:06:00,980 --> 0:06:06,160
 But it is the most clear explanation I have found until now.

92
0:06:06,160 --> 0:06:08,920
 So that's why it's here.

93
0:06:08,920 --> 0:06:22,900
 So an AS is an organization, as I said, and we have used what we call AS numbers or ASNs

94
0:06:22,900 --> 0:06:23,900
 to identify.

95
0:06:23,900 --> 0:06:26,340
 Identify an organization.

96
0:06:26,340 --> 0:06:27,340
 That could be your transit provider.

97
0:06:27,340 --> 0:06:31,440
 That could also be your friends in the other side of the facility.

98
0:06:31,440 --> 0:06:37,120
 And they have some, well, you and the other ASs have some prefixes allocated to them so

99
0:06:37,120 --> 0:06:44,780
 you know where the content should go or the traffic should go.

100
0:06:44,780 --> 0:06:47,820
 So the routing policy.

101
0:06:47,820 --> 0:06:52,320
 Well it's found in databases.

102
0:06:52,320 --> 0:06:53,320
 Regional internet.

103
0:06:53,320 --> 0:06:59,700
 Registry database like RIPE's database.

104
0:06:59,700 --> 0:07:08,040
 These routing policies says something like I have authorized to use these IP prefixes

105
0:07:08,040 --> 0:07:15,800
 and they should, so now see IP prefixes at all traffic to these prefixes should be different

106
0:07:15,800 --> 0:07:16,800
 to me.

107
0:07:16,800 --> 0:07:21,560
 It could also be that you have some customers that may be a little bit more fancy with their

108
0:07:21,560 --> 0:07:22,560
 networking.

109
0:07:23,320 --> 0:07:28,000
 And they would also like to announce through you.

110
0:07:28,000 --> 0:07:31,160
 So you are their transit.

111
0:07:31,160 --> 0:07:37,680
 And that could be some business customers, for example, or in our case, Labitat or me

112
0:07:37,680 --> 0:07:41,960
 where Labitat is my uplink.

113
0:07:41,960 --> 0:07:49,700
 I have included a lot of places, links to things that could be read more since I found

114
0:07:49,700 --> 0:07:50,700
 this useful.

115
0:07:50,700 --> 0:07:51,700
 I have left them in.

116
0:07:51,700 --> 0:07:52,700
 Okay.

117
0:07:52,700 --> 0:07:58,080
 So peering and transit.

118
0:07:58,080 --> 0:08:04,460
 Well first peering is that we agree it's free to both of us.

119
0:08:04,460 --> 0:08:09,420
 There is some optics fibers included and like things like cross connect where you have to

120
0:08:09,420 --> 0:08:15,520
 like you are located in data center and you would like to connect to the other side of

121
0:08:15,520 --> 0:08:16,520
 the data center.

122
0:08:16,520 --> 0:08:18,580
 So the data center takes a bit of money for that.

123
0:08:18,580 --> 0:08:19,700
 It costs usually some X amount per month.

124
0:08:19,700 --> 0:08:20,700
 Okay.

125
0:08:20,700 --> 0:08:21,700
 So that's that.

126
0:08:21,700 --> 0:08:22,700
 Okay.

127
0:08:22,700 --> 0:08:25,700
 So we only send traffic to each other.

128
0:08:25,700 --> 0:08:28,460
 That is totally fine.

129
0:08:28,460 --> 0:08:35,140
 As long as we don't, that's like a balance and we don't tip the balance where I send

130
0:08:35,140 --> 0:08:38,920
 a lot of traffic to you and you don't send that much traffic to me.

131
0:08:38,920 --> 0:08:39,920
 But it's fine.

132
0:08:39,920 --> 0:08:42,060
 We peer with a lot of people.

133
0:08:42,060 --> 0:08:43,700
 Then we also have transit.

134
0:08:43,700 --> 0:08:47,700
 So transit is, yes, where it costs per megabit.

135
0:08:47,700 --> 0:08:50,700
 And this I will transport traffic from you to other networks.

136
0:08:50,700 --> 0:08:51,700
 Okay.

137
0:08:51,700 --> 0:08:58,320
 As I always said, it's if you want to go to other side of the globe, you perhaps don't

138
0:08:58,320 --> 0:09:02,560
 have the funds to lay a cable over the Atlantic or something similar.

139
0:09:02,560 --> 0:09:07,940
 So someone has done that for you and you would just pay them.

140
0:09:07,940 --> 0:09:12,100
 Well what is the instant exchange then?

141
0:09:12,100 --> 0:09:15,580
 We keep local traffic local.

142
0:09:15,580 --> 0:09:17,700
 We avoid what we call the Trombone effect.

143
0:09:17,700 --> 0:09:18,700
 This is an image.

144
0:09:18,700 --> 0:09:19,700
 Okay.

145
0:09:19,700 --> 0:09:29,040
 This is an image of the United States, San Francisco, New York, and Los Angeles.

146
0:09:29,040 --> 0:09:34,940
 So what would be the shortest path between San Francisco and Los Angeles?

147
0:09:34,940 --> 0:09:40,160
 Clearly not New York at least.

148
0:09:40,160 --> 0:09:46,320
 That can sometimes happen with how due to some characteristics with our network routing,

149
0:09:46,320 --> 0:09:48,320
 you usually don't have a lot of traffic.

150
0:09:48,320 --> 0:09:49,320
 Okay.

151
0:09:49,320 --> 0:09:57,700
 You look at the shortest path, for example, in many, many cases, also other things.

152
0:09:57,700 --> 0:10:03,580
 But it could be that your transit just didn't have a direct connection between San Francisco

153
0:10:03,580 --> 0:10:05,440
 and Los Angeles.

154
0:10:05,440 --> 0:10:10,480
 So you would need to go over New York.

155
0:10:10,480 --> 0:10:15,320
 So we have the instant exchange to avoid these kind of things.

156
0:10:15,320 --> 0:10:18,660
 It also gives lower latency because, again, we keep local traffic local.

157
0:10:18,660 --> 0:10:27,040
 It's easier to interconnect with other networks.

158
0:10:27,040 --> 0:10:33,380
 So what if we are two small providers and we don't necessarily have the need to connect

159
0:10:33,380 --> 0:10:35,380
 to each other?

160
0:10:35,380 --> 0:10:40,660
 But why should we pay transit when we are located in the same facility?

161
0:10:40,660 --> 0:10:48,660
 We can't justify paying the fees to have this cross-connect active.

162
0:10:48,660 --> 0:10:51,660
 We have similar things.

163
0:10:51,660 --> 0:11:00,360
 So when you have the internet exchange, it makes things a bit easier when you are local.

164
0:11:00,360 --> 0:11:07,860
 So here is a very, very simplified topology of an internet exchange point.

165
0:11:07,860 --> 0:11:11,960
 Well there are four providers of some kind.

166
0:11:11,960 --> 0:11:17,040
 They all connect with one link into a Meet Me room, as we call it.

167
0:11:17,040 --> 0:11:18,000
 And they connect to a meeting room.

168
0:11:18,000 --> 0:11:32,520
 With this, we now, instead of everybody connecting to each other, I have one cable to you, you

169
0:11:32,520 --> 0:11:36,940
 have one cable to you, I have one cable to you, we just have one cable in and then we

170
0:11:36,940 --> 0:11:38,760
 get the traffic via that cable.

171
0:11:38,760 --> 0:11:46,720
 That could be like a larger cable, for example.

172
0:11:46,720 --> 0:11:54,900
 What I showed here is, yes, we do have the meet-me-room, but in an internet exchange,

173
0:11:54,900 --> 0:12:06,580
 we also can go from what we call bilateral to multilateral peering.

174
0:12:06,580 --> 0:12:13,900
 It is from many-to-many to one-to-many, as the image also shows.

175
0:12:13,900 --> 0:12:16,600
 We have the route server.

176
0:12:16,600 --> 0:12:26,000
 Again, I have explained this because it was not easy for me in the first five hours to

177
0:12:26,000 --> 0:12:30,280
 understand, why do we need a route server?

178
0:12:30,280 --> 0:12:34,540
 It was not clear, but now it is more clear for me at least.

179
0:12:34,540 --> 0:12:39,700
 So the control plane traffic is now aggregated to the route server.

180
0:12:39,700 --> 0:12:45,780
 We don't necessarily aggregate the data plane traffic.

181
0:12:45,780 --> 0:12:48,080
 but we at least control the traffic.

182
0:12:49,420 --> 0:12:50,760
 It kind of looks like this.

183
0:12:51,800 --> 0:12:56,800
 So we need less maintenance, we need less points,

184
0:12:57,340 --> 0:13:02,340
 like less configurations that you can screw up with.

185
0:13:05,460 --> 0:13:08,820
 If I'm already connected to a route server

186
0:13:08,820 --> 0:13:13,820
 and we have some new clients that comes to our IXP

187
0:13:13,820 --> 0:13:15,500
 and then joins the route server,

188
0:13:15,500 --> 0:13:17,260
 we can immediately peer with each other

189
0:13:17,260 --> 0:13:20,320
 without necessarily agreeing

190
0:13:21,120 --> 0:13:24,260
 and talk to each other directly.

191
0:13:24,260 --> 0:13:27,940
 We can have our peering policy set as,

192
0:13:27,940 --> 0:13:31,140
 yes, I would like to accept everybody who's on the route server.

193
0:13:32,580 --> 0:13:33,760
 We can also have a little more sense

194
0:13:33,760 --> 0:13:37,600
 on what is going on in our IXP, like traffic stats.

195
0:13:39,940 --> 0:13:42,560
 So our route server looks like this.

196
0:13:42,560 --> 0:13:43,800
 It's a very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very,

197
0:13:43,800 --> 0:13:44,940
 very, very small machine.

198
0:13:46,020 --> 0:13:47,420
 It uses six for the power.

199
0:13:50,100 --> 0:13:53,360
 We chose this because it was free and we had it,

200
0:13:53,360 --> 0:13:54,740
 I had it in my storage.

201
0:13:54,740 --> 0:13:59,740
 So it fits really well for our use case.

202
0:14:01,220 --> 0:14:04,180
 The Labasat Internet Exchange is only

203
0:14:04,180 --> 0:14:07,760
 for very small devices, embedded devices,

204
0:14:07,760 --> 0:14:11,920
 like APU2 or Raspberry Pi.

205
0:14:11,920 --> 0:14:12,760
 So,

206
0:14:13,800 --> 0:14:18,800
 yeah, it didn't really make sense to have a large machine

207
0:14:20,140 --> 0:14:24,380
 that could do fancy stuff and have many more routes

208
0:14:24,380 --> 0:14:26,260
 and things like that.

209
0:14:26,260 --> 0:14:30,020
 So the software is, well, Debian is,

210
0:14:30,020 --> 0:14:33,600
 we use a route server as a config parser

211
0:14:33,600 --> 0:14:38,460
 to then to create our BERT config.

212
0:14:38,460 --> 0:14:40,600
 We use BERT as a BTP speaker.

213
0:14:40,600 --> 0:14:43,100
 So a route server does a very, very, very, very, very, very,

214
0:14:43,100 --> 0:14:47,300
 there's a lot of automation of,

215
0:14:47,300 --> 0:14:49,900
 like we have a list of clients and we have some,

216
0:14:52,900 --> 0:14:55,120
 we have some AS sets and we have some prefixes

217
0:14:55,120 --> 0:14:57,900
 and similar things.

218
0:14:57,900 --> 0:15:02,480
 And then a route server creates all the,

219
0:15:02,480 --> 0:15:05,260
 all the 300,000 line config files.

220
0:15:06,180 --> 0:15:07,840
 So we don't need to maintain that.

221
0:15:10,480 --> 0:15:12,400
 Yes, server hosting, it's located in Labicorps,

222
0:15:12,400 --> 0:15:17,400
 again, there's links all over the place.

223
0:15:19,100 --> 0:15:24,100
 And we, yeah, Oliver and Eskian will go more into details

224
0:15:24,860 --> 0:15:27,980
 on the Labicorps on a talk on Sunday, so.

225
0:15:28,820 --> 0:15:30,300
 But there's a very short version is,

226
0:15:30,300 --> 0:15:33,800
 it's intended for things like Raspberry Pis and APU2s.

227
0:15:36,100 --> 0:15:41,100
 But at Bornhag, you can connect to a Labifer village,

228
0:15:41,240 --> 0:15:42,200
 or you can connect via BERT.

229
0:15:42,200 --> 0:15:45,020
 You can connect via VLAN, which I haven't received yet.

230
0:15:45,020 --> 0:15:48,000
 So, yeah, but you can connect.

231
0:15:49,240 --> 0:15:52,880
 So we have, we have made it so,

232
0:15:52,880 --> 0:15:54,900
 since our uplink is very nice,

233
0:15:55,840 --> 0:16:00,660
 that we have transported the VLAN via Labitat

234
0:16:00,660 --> 0:16:04,080
 and then over FiberVue,

235
0:16:05,680 --> 0:16:09,660
 and which is then Bornhag's uplink.

236
0:16:09,660 --> 0:16:10,500
 And that means we can have the whole VLAN transported,

237
0:16:10,500 --> 0:16:11,400
 and that means we can have the whole VLAN transported,

238
0:16:11,400 --> 0:16:11,780
 and that means we can have the whole VLAN transported,

239
0:16:11,780 --> 0:16:12,620
 and that means we can have the whole VLAN transported,

240
0:16:12,620 --> 0:16:13,440
 and that means we can have the whole VLAN transported,

241
0:16:13,440 --> 0:16:16,440
 and that the whole peeing line transported down to the camp.

242
0:16:16,440 --> 0:16:17,540
 and that the whole peeing line transported down to the camp.

243
0:16:17,540 --> 0:16:20,540
 That's a bit weird, but we can, since we could, we did it.

244
0:16:20,540 --> 0:16:22,540
 That's a bit weird, but we can, since we could, we did it.

245
0:16:24,180 --> 0:16:26,100
 So our switch looks like,

246
0:16:26,100 --> 0:16:28,120
 our switch and our rack looks like this.

247
0:16:28,120 --> 0:16:29,940
 It's a horrible mess.

248
0:16:29,940 --> 0:16:34,940
 But again, the switch was a pre-used thing,

249
0:16:36,360 --> 0:16:38,380
 it's a Cisco switch.

250
0:16:38,380 --> 0:16:39,860
 We are all using it.

251
0:16:39,860 --> 0:16:41,260
 It could do Mac port filtering, and that's like,

252
0:16:41,260 --> 0:16:43,260
 It could do Mac port filtering, and that's like,

253
0:16:43,260 --> 0:16:46,660
 fine, it's nice for writing loops.

254
0:16:48,580 --> 0:16:51,800
 So, yeah, it's a switch,

255
0:16:51,800 --> 0:16:54,640
 that's not really much to show,

256
0:16:54,640 --> 0:16:55,880
 other than they can do that.

257
0:16:55,880 --> 0:16:58,980
 We actually tested out a switch which we found out

258
0:16:58,980 --> 0:17:02,860
 could not use Mac port filtering, so yeah.

259
0:17:02,860 --> 0:17:04,020
 That's why we keep this.

260
0:17:06,660 --> 0:17:09,680
 We have a peeing policy set up.

261
0:17:11,260 --> 0:17:14,840
 So when you join a Internet Exchange or join,

262
0:17:16,400 --> 0:17:18,760
 start peering with other networks,

263
0:17:18,760 --> 0:17:22,560
 it, you accept that peering policy.

264
0:17:22,560 --> 0:17:25,920
 So it could be like, I only accept traffic

265
0:17:25,920 --> 0:17:30,920
 that is distant to you, and how, and sorry,

266
0:17:31,040 --> 0:17:33,440
 you only, I want to send traffic distant to you,

267
0:17:33,440 --> 0:17:36,120
 and you want to send traffic distant to me.

268
0:17:36,120 --> 0:17:39,380
 In a Internet Exchange, we have a few more things,

269
0:17:39,380 --> 0:17:40,220
 not much.

270
0:17:40,220 --> 0:17:41,100
 Not much. Well, we say a few things, not much.

271
0:17:41,100 --> 0:17:50,680
 We can say we will accept IPv4, ARP and IPv6 addresses, Ethernet frames, sorry.

272
0:17:50,680 --> 0:17:57,220
 We do not like ProxyARP, we do not like OSPF and other kinds of things.

273
0:17:57,220 --> 0:18:04,740
 We will do make port filtering again to avoid a lot of loops and the same with ProxyARP,

274
0:18:04,740 --> 0:18:09,300
 it creates funny things on the network.

275
0:18:09,300 --> 0:18:24,240
 So yes, we will not, routes learned through the peering network are not allowed to be

276
0:18:24,240 --> 0:18:35,300
 announced by BGP and we also would not like to be connected via a tunnel of some kind

277
0:18:35,300 --> 0:18:38,840
 where the MTU is lower than 1500.

278
0:18:38,840 --> 0:18:46,000
 So this means you have to be directly connected to us and not a remote IEX which defeats a

279
0:18:46,000 --> 0:18:50,280
 lot of the purposes of an internet exchange.

280
0:18:50,280 --> 0:18:57,320
 Though I have nothing against remote internet exchanges, but for all purposes, it didn't

281
0:18:57,320 --> 0:19:01,920
 really fit.

282
0:19:01,920 --> 0:19:08,780
 So well, you have to get some IP address.

283
0:19:08,780 --> 0:19:14,960
 Also, internet resources, I call it here, but yeah, IP allocations.

284
0:19:14,960 --> 0:19:22,640
 So an AS number and an IP address is like, there is a large pool, I usually call it a

285
0:19:22,640 --> 0:19:31,660
 cake, so a large cake, IANA owns a cake and then RIPE, which is the organization handing

286
0:19:31,660 --> 0:19:35,780
 out IP addresses in Europe and Russia and Middle East.

287
0:19:35,780 --> 0:19:38,020
 They get a bit smaller.

288
0:19:38,020 --> 0:19:43,680
 They get a bit smaller piece of the cake, which they can then hand out.

289
0:19:43,680 --> 0:19:51,920
 So you have the local internet registry that then they can then have a little smaller piece

290
0:19:51,920 --> 0:19:55,920
 of the cake, which they can then hand out to you.

291
0:19:55,920 --> 0:20:04,640
 So RIPE do not want to talk to you, and they have decided that they do not talk to you

292
0:20:04,640 --> 0:20:06,200
 unless you are a local internet registry.

293
0:20:06,200 --> 0:20:07,200
 And that means you are RIPE NCC.

294
0:20:07,200 --> 0:20:08,000
 That means you are RIPE NCC.

295
0:20:08,020 --> 0:20:10,180
 That means you are RIPE NCC member.

296
0:20:10,180 --> 0:20:15,300
 I am a private person, so if I want an AS number, I do not necessarily want to pay the

297
0:20:15,300 --> 0:20:21,700
 1,600 euro fee per year to be able to talk to RIPE.

298
0:20:21,700 --> 0:20:29,540
 So you need a sponsoring LIA to be able to get addresses.

299
0:20:29,540 --> 0:20:32,300
 You can find some nice people.

300
0:20:32,300 --> 0:20:37,680
 You can also pay a bit for it, and there are multiple ways to do it.

301
0:20:38,020 --> 0:20:41,380
 So we have found a LIA that we really like.

302
0:20:41,380 --> 0:20:49,460
 It is a project called Free Transit Project, and they are some nice people.

303
0:20:49,460 --> 0:20:55,460
 So what is the difference between IP addresses when you have an IXP and you are a network

304
0:20:55,460 --> 0:21:01,420
 operator is that you would usually like your IP address to be globally routable.

305
0:21:01,420 --> 0:21:02,900
 That means it is your IP addresses, and the route to them is in everybody's routing table.

306
0:21:02,900 --> 0:21:03,820
 So basically what you are doing here is you are going to go to the IP addresses at this

307
0:21:03,820 --> 0:21:06,780
 IP address and you are going to go to your IP addresses at this IP address and the IP address

308
0:21:06,780 --> 0:21:07,780
 and the IP address is in this IP address.

309
0:21:08,020 --> 0:21:20,840
 So, that is reasonable, but when you have an IXP, you do not necessarily want to be

310
0:21:20,840 --> 0:21:22,520
 globally routable.

311
0:21:22,520 --> 0:21:29,300
 There's no reasons for the routers in your network to have a global route.

312
0:21:29,300 --> 0:21:36,040
 It should only be the routers on the peering LAN which should be able to connect to you.

313
0:21:36,040 --> 0:21:39,280
 So yeah.

314
0:21:39,280 --> 0:21:52,980
 You have the, well, yeah, when you, well, so how do you, how do I know that you have

315
0:21:52,980 --> 0:21:56,180
 some resources allocated?

316
0:21:56,180 --> 0:22:04,020
 It is available in the regional Internet registries databases, again, like RIPE, that we use in

317
0:22:04,020 --> 0:22:05,420
 our case.

318
0:22:05,420 --> 0:22:12,420
 And you, so what you need to create an IX, or just as a person, you need an organization

319
0:22:12,420 --> 0:22:22,240
 object, you need a maintainer object, you need a person object, and also, as a network

320
0:22:22,240 --> 0:22:24,800
 operator, you need an AS set.

321
0:22:24,800 --> 0:22:32,660
 This is for other networks to include in their routing policies, so they, so others can know

322
0:22:32,660 --> 0:22:34,660
 that you are a network operator.

323
0:22:34,660 --> 0:22:35,180
 Okay.

324
0:22:35,180 --> 0:22:40,000
 And that they are allowed to announce your prefixes, for example.

325
0:22:40,000 --> 0:22:47,640
 And I've, again, included a course in, a small, very nice course, in the bottom here.

326
0:22:47,640 --> 0:22:53,240
 So I also found out there's some miscellaneous info I could never have guessed.

327
0:22:53,240 --> 0:23:00,180
 When talking to our local Internet registry, which then forwarded it all directly to RIPE,

328
0:23:00,180 --> 0:23:02,180
 well, the obvious one is that, well, your IX needs a name.

329
0:23:02,180 --> 0:23:03,180
 So you need a name.

330
0:23:03,180 --> 0:23:04,180
 So you need a name.

331
0:23:04,180 --> 0:23:05,180
 So you need a name.

332
0:23:05,180 --> 0:23:06,180
 Yeah.

333
0:23:06,180 --> 0:23:07,180
 I guess.

334
0:23:07,180 --> 0:23:12,120
 So do you also, like, want a route server?

335
0:23:12,120 --> 0:23:13,820
 You have to, like, think of that.

336
0:23:13,820 --> 0:23:15,800
 And you probably do.

337
0:23:15,800 --> 0:23:19,880
 So then that means you need an AS number.

338
0:23:19,880 --> 0:23:26,320
 And also, you should probably get a 16-bit AS number, because you never know if some

339
0:23:26,320 --> 0:23:30,760
 customers bring really old equipment that cannot handle 32-bit AS numbers.

340
0:23:30,760 --> 0:23:34,180
 A little bonus is that, also, that a 32-bit AS number is a bit more expensive than a 32-bit

341
0:23:34,180 --> 0:23:35,180
 AS number.

342
0:23:35,180 --> 0:23:38,080
 A 32-bit AS number fits on a Danish number plate.

343
0:23:38,080 --> 0:23:47,560
 So you can get some, you can find a number plate that is valid in Denmark.

344
0:23:47,560 --> 0:23:50,000
 So you also need some prefixes.

345
0:23:50,000 --> 0:24:00,920
 And this is one of the reasons why I said this, but not global routable and globally

346
0:24:00,920 --> 0:24:01,920
 routable.

347
0:24:01,920 --> 0:24:11,320
 You do have a shortage of IPv4 IP addresses, so RIPE is not very keen to hand them out

348
0:24:11,320 --> 0:24:13,880
 unless you really, really need.

349
0:24:13,880 --> 0:24:17,600
 They have set aside some addresses.

350
0:24:17,600 --> 0:24:26,300
 And that's why you say, yes, I so and so swear that I would not use these two as normal services.

351
0:24:26,300 --> 0:24:28,920
 And then you will get them.

352
0:24:28,920 --> 0:24:29,920
 Hooray.

353
0:24:29,920 --> 0:24:30,920
 Hooray.

354
0:24:30,920 --> 0:24:31,920
 Hooray.

355
0:24:31,920 --> 0:24:32,920
 I will do that.

356
0:24:32,920 --> 0:24:36,880
 And then you will get the IP address if you really need, but you probably do not need

357
0:24:36,880 --> 0:24:37,880
 a large address.

358
0:24:37,880 --> 0:24:44,280
 We use six addresses out of a lot.

359
0:24:44,280 --> 0:24:45,860
 So yeah.

360
0:24:45,860 --> 0:24:55,100
 So, yeah, again, things I had not thought of was get a hold of a seed or contract confirming

361
0:24:55,100 --> 0:24:57,820
 connectivity to IXP Colo site.

362
0:24:57,820 --> 0:25:01,160
 I had to find our bell to our uplink.

363
0:25:01,160 --> 0:25:01,820
 Oh, yeah.

364
0:25:01,820 --> 0:25:08,180
 I guess it makes sense that our facilities somehow should have an uplink.

365
0:25:08,180 --> 0:25:14,620
 You also need to say, yes, I do have three customers that are willing to appear at our

366
0:25:14,620 --> 0:25:27,280
 XP, so I'm not just creating an XP for one, for me, and then I have no customers.

367
0:25:27,280 --> 0:25:33,780
 This also matters if you want to go in and be present on peeringdb as an XP.

368
0:25:33,780 --> 0:25:43,860
 Again, it's like the magic number is at least three, and also with the XP database.

369
0:25:43,860 --> 0:25:53,460
 These are some databases that network operators use to find out what XP should we go to and

370
0:25:53,460 --> 0:25:55,980
 what facilities should we go to and who is there.

371
0:25:55,980 --> 0:25:57,260
 So it's a very nice way.

372
0:25:57,260 --> 0:26:01,600
 It's a way of network operators talking to each other.

373
0:26:01,600 --> 0:26:04,820
 It's kind of like a social media, but we don't post pictures.

374
0:26:04,820 --> 0:26:09,480
 We just post where we are.

375
0:26:09,480 --> 0:26:17,540
 So yeah, again, facilities, like what is my address, and then you also need at least one

376
0:26:17,540 --> 0:26:21,300
 contact person and a phone number.

377
0:26:21,300 --> 0:26:27,260
 Just things I didn't know, and then it took five days extra to get all these.

378
0:26:27,260 --> 0:26:34,480
 So if you can send it at the same time, it will save a few days of talking back and forth.

379
0:26:34,480 --> 0:26:39,980
 So yes, the local internet registry, well, we use the Free Transit project.

380
0:26:39,980 --> 0:26:42,140
 I have used it for my own AS number.

381
0:26:42,140 --> 0:26:46,040
 There are some nice people, also some hackers.

382
0:26:46,040 --> 0:26:54,260
 So I like this, but also I have a bias because I know some of them personally.

383
0:26:54,260 --> 0:26:55,260
 Yeah.

384
0:26:55,260 --> 0:26:56,260
 Yeah.

385
0:26:56,260 --> 0:26:57,260
 Yeah.

386
0:26:57,260 --> 0:27:03,260
 So if you want to find some local internet registry services, you can search on an engine

387
0:27:03,260 --> 0:27:10,300
 right there service, and someone will gladly take your money to get an AS number and some

388
0:27:10,300 --> 0:27:13,860
 prefixes.

389
0:27:13,860 --> 0:27:19,440
 It is really expensive as just an organization to get IPv4 addresses, but I won't dwell too

390
0:27:19,440 --> 0:27:20,440
 much into that.

391
0:27:20,440 --> 0:27:25,300
 It's just because we have a shortage, and there's a market for that shortage.

392
0:27:25,300 --> 0:27:26,300
 So yeah.

393
0:27:26,300 --> 0:27:27,700
 So similar projects, well...

394
0:27:27,700 --> 0:27:28,700
 Sorry.

395
0:27:28,700 --> 0:27:29,700
 My tech phone is calling.

396
0:27:29,700 --> 0:27:30,700
 Okay.

397
0:27:30,700 --> 0:27:31,700
 There we go.

398
0:27:31,700 --> 0:27:36,700
 I'm not answering that.

399
0:27:36,700 --> 0:27:37,700
 Sorry.

400
0:27:37,700 --> 0:27:38,700
 No.

401
0:27:38,700 --> 0:27:39,700
 It's all right.

402
0:27:39,700 --> 0:27:40,700
 It's fine.

403
0:27:40,700 --> 0:27:41,700
 Thank you.

404
0:27:41,700 --> 0:27:42,700
 Thank you.

405
0:27:42,700 --> 0:27:43,700
 Thank you.

406
0:27:43,700 --> 0:27:44,700
 Thank you so much.

407
0:27:44,700 --> 0:27:45,700
 Oh, hello.

408
0:27:45,700 --> 0:27:46,700
 Thank you.

409
0:27:46,700 --> 0:27:47,700
 Nice to meet you.

410
0:27:47,700 --> 0:27:48,700
 Nice to meet you.

411
0:27:48,700 --> 0:27:49,700
 Nice to meet you.

412
0:27:49,700 --> 0:27:50,700
 Yeah.

413
0:27:50,700 --> 0:27:51,700
 Thank you.

414
0:27:51,700 --> 0:27:52,700
 Thanks, guys.

415
0:27:52,700 --> 0:27:53,700
 All right.

416
0:27:53,700 --> 0:27:54,700
 Thanks, everyone.

417
0:27:54,700 --> 0:27:55,700
 Thank you.

418
0:27:55,700 --> 0:28:07,520
 There are many internet exchanges in the world that are community run by network operators,

419
0:28:07,520 --> 0:28:12,100
 and it kind of makes sense.

420
0:28:12,100 --> 0:28:15,380
 Some people got to get an OAB and said, hey, why don't we do this?

421
0:28:15,380 --> 0:28:17,060
 And then they did this.

422
0:28:17,060 --> 0:28:27,300
 So yeah, that is also commercially run, a lot of them also, but I find it kind of inspiring

423
0:28:27,300 --> 0:28:35,880
 that a lot of them are just, hey, let's do this, and then we did this, and people donated

424
0:28:35,880 --> 0:28:43,200
 equipment and money and hosting and stuff, and it kind of just worked really nice.

425
0:28:43,200 --> 0:28:46,900
 So yeah.

426
0:28:46,900 --> 0:28:47,020
 That's all.

427
0:28:47,060 --> 0:28:55,380
 There's also some hosting, some projects similar to ours, our hackerspace.

428
0:28:55,380 --> 0:29:01,600
 We have Coloclue in Amsterdam, we have K-Space in Tallinn, we have Community Rec in Zurich.

429
0:29:01,600 --> 0:29:08,560
 They offer some hosting of some kind also to small machines and some for larger machines

430
0:29:08,560 --> 0:29:14,000
 for private persons or small businesses.

431
0:29:14,000 --> 0:29:16,900
 There's also BGP.whatthefuck.

432
0:29:16,900 --> 0:29:25,400
 They do BGP stuff similar to us, but they are just in Warsaw instead.

433
0:29:25,400 --> 0:29:31,840
 And we have InBerlin also, which I learned recently also existed.

434
0:29:31,840 --> 0:29:38,040
 So if you're interested in finding some of these, I will say thanks to my collaborators.

435
0:29:38,040 --> 0:29:43,900
 So I did this as a school project also, so hooray, I got easy test points for this thing.

436
0:29:43,900 --> 0:29:46,740
 Olivia and Daniel.

437
0:29:46,740 --> 0:29:53,280
 They helped me build this, and we also have Jori, which is from the Free Transit project

438
0:29:53,280 --> 0:29:54,980
 and really nice.

439
0:29:54,980 --> 0:30:02,180
 And then Aspern Tønnesen for having way too much knowledge about networking.

440
0:30:02,180 --> 0:30:08,940
 And it's a bit dangerous asking a question because then you get a very long answer.

441
0:30:08,940 --> 0:30:16,580
 So here are some good resources, like PNGDB, the interconnection database.

442
0:30:16,580 --> 0:30:20,340
 Yes, knock meetups like we have in Denmark.

443
0:30:20,340 --> 0:30:21,340
 Most countries have them.

444
0:30:21,340 --> 0:30:22,340
 That's the RIPE Academy.

445
0:30:22,340 --> 0:30:27,340
 I learned a lot on IPv6 with the course.

446
0:30:27,340 --> 0:30:29,580
 That was really nice.

447
0:30:29,580 --> 0:30:32,080
 You don't have to take the certificate.

448
0:30:32,080 --> 0:30:33,360
 You can take the course.

449
0:30:33,360 --> 0:30:37,820
 You can also pay to take the certificate if you want, but you can learn a lot for free.

450
0:30:37,820 --> 0:30:44,820
 And yes, the Network Start Research Center.

451
0:30:44,820 --> 0:30:52,060
 They also helped me in some of the introductions and slides they have.

452
0:30:52,060 --> 0:30:54,880
 It was really nice.

453
0:30:54,880 --> 0:30:59,420
 That's also, I didn't go into BGP filtering.

454
0:30:59,420 --> 0:31:04,020
 It's a very important thing of network security.

455
0:31:04,020 --> 0:31:11,580
 But there is a small guide that InnoNog have made collaboratively, and then InnoNog also

456
0:31:11,580 --> 0:31:14,380
 have a thing they call InnoNog Ring.

457
0:31:14,380 --> 0:31:22,900
 It's a nice way to find out how reachable is my prefix.

458
0:31:22,900 --> 0:31:30,600
 And you can find us in Bornhag, in the Labitat or Labifery Village, as a tech number.

459
0:31:30,600 --> 0:31:35,140
 And in all other days, you can find us on Labitat.

460
0:31:35,140 --> 0:31:37,140
 We have a website for the IX.

461
0:31:37,140 --> 0:31:40,000
 You can also find us on PNGDB.

462
0:31:40,000 --> 0:31:43,440
 So if you already got an AS number, you can join us.

463
0:31:43,440 --> 0:31:44,380
 Yes.

464
0:31:44,380 --> 0:31:46,380
 We would very much like to have you.

465
0:31:46,380 --> 0:31:49,380
 Again, VLAN is not decided.

466
0:31:49,380 --> 0:31:55,820
 We can also, if you bring a machine, we can probably host it.

467
0:31:55,820 --> 0:32:01,460
 And if anyone wants to kind of sponsor this project, because it's been paid out of my

468
0:32:01,460 --> 0:32:07,680
 money until now, it wasn't really that expensive, but still, I'm a student, so money.

469
0:32:07,680 --> 0:32:09,940
 All hardware is just things we found.

470
0:32:09,940 --> 0:32:12,900
 And we're very nice with some updates.

471
0:32:12,900 --> 0:32:13,900
 Thank you.

472
0:32:14,380 --> 0:32:20,580
 Updated hardware and maybe a second Uplink, because you never know, some machine may just

473
0:32:20,580 --> 0:32:24,460
 dig up the road and kill the whole Uplink or something, something.

474
0:32:24,460 --> 0:32:27,420
 And we like stickers.

475
0:32:27,420 --> 0:32:30,200
 So what is next for this project?

476
0:32:30,200 --> 0:32:34,500
 Well, we have RxP running, which is pretty nice.

477
0:32:34,500 --> 0:32:37,800
 We have a route server running.

478
0:32:37,800 --> 0:32:42,700
 But we would also like to have some, well, more peers, of course, but Looking Glass,

479
0:32:42,700 --> 0:32:44,180
 which we have not set up.

480
0:32:44,180 --> 0:32:57,300
 But I would very much like to set up ARP sponge to limit ARP requests, yeah, more monitoring,

481
0:32:57,300 --> 0:33:01,600
 more documentation, and set up a RPKI relay.

482
0:33:01,600 --> 0:33:06,960
 I have set up one for my own network, but not for this.

483
0:33:06,960 --> 0:33:12,180
 It uses a very inefficient way to check if AS number and prefix match.

484
0:33:12,180 --> 0:33:13,180
 So, yeah.

485
0:33:13,180 --> 0:33:14,180
 All right.

486
0:33:14,180 --> 0:33:15,180
 Thank you for listening.

487
0:33:15,180 --> 0:33:16,180
 Here's to you all.

488
0:33:16,180 --> 0:33:17,180
 Good talk.

489
0:33:44,180 --> 0:33:45,180
 Thank you.

490
0:33:45,180 --> 0:33:46,180
 Thank you.

491
0:33:46,180 --> 0:33:47,180
 Bye bye.

492
0:33:47,180 --> 0:33:48,180
 Bye bye.

493
0:33:48,180 --> 0:33:49,180
 Bye bye.

494
0:33:49,180 --> 0:33:50,180
 Bye bye.

495
0:33:50,180 --> 0:33:51,180
 .

496
0:34:14,180 --> 0:34:44,160
 Thank you.

497
0:34:44,180 --> 0:34:46,180
 You

498
0:35:14,180 --> 0:35:16,180
 You

499
0:35:44,180 --> 0:35:46,180
 You
