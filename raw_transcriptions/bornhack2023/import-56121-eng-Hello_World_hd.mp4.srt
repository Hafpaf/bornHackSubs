0:00:07,000 --> 0:00:10,000
 Hello, everybody, and welcome to BornHack 2023.

3
0:00:21,500 --> 0:00:25,000
 The first organizers arrived here about a week ago,

4
0:00:25,000 --> 0:00:28,500
 and it is insane to look around and see how much has changed,

5
0:00:28,500 --> 0:00:32,500
 and all the volunteers who have helped have done so much work

6
0:00:32,500 --> 0:00:34,500
 and deserve all our gratitude.

7
0:00:34,500 --> 0:00:36,500
 We'll get back to that later,

8
0:00:36,500 --> 0:00:40,500
 but it is fantastic to see everybody putting up camps

9
0:00:40,500 --> 0:00:42,500
 and moving into the field and unpacking

10
0:00:42,500 --> 0:00:46,500
 and starting to build our temporary home for the next week.

11
0:00:46,500 --> 0:00:49,500
 Well, technically, BornHack is a two-week event, right?

12
0:00:49,500 --> 0:00:52,500
 Only the volunteers know that secret,

13
0:00:52,500 --> 0:00:54,500
 so you get to be here much longer

14
0:00:54,500 --> 0:00:57,500
 if you help out with build-up and tear-down.

15
0:00:57,500 --> 0:00:58,500
 No.

16
0:00:58,500 --> 0:01:02,500
 We are very excited.

17
0:01:02,500 --> 0:01:05,500
 This has been a year of many challenges,

18
0:01:05,500 --> 0:01:07,500
 and, well, it always is,

19
0:01:07,500 --> 0:01:10,500
 but maybe some particularly big ones this year.

20
0:01:10,500 --> 0:01:13,500
 In particular, some sad news.

21
0:01:13,500 --> 0:01:16,500
 We lost one of our organizers, Jesper, this year,

22
0:01:16,500 --> 0:01:18,500
 or last year, in October,

23
0:01:18,500 --> 0:01:21,500
 very suddenly and way too soon,

24
0:01:21,500 --> 0:01:24,500
 and it hit all of us hard.

25
0:01:24,500 --> 0:01:30,500
 We dedicated the tagline for this year to Jesper,

26
0:01:30,500 --> 0:01:31,500
 Make Legacy,

27
0:01:31,500 --> 0:01:35,500
 because we feel that, well, everybody wants to leave a legacy,

28
0:01:35,500 --> 0:01:39,500
 and Jesper absolutely did leave a legacy.

29
0:01:39,500 --> 0:01:44,500
 He had a tremendous impact on BornHack as an organization

30
0:01:44,500 --> 0:01:48,500
 and on all of us personally.

31
0:01:48,500 --> 0:01:53,500
 And...

32
0:01:53,500 --> 0:01:55,500
 he left a giant void.

33
0:01:57,500 --> 0:02:00,500
 Thank you to the people in info

34
0:02:00,500 --> 0:02:02,500
 and the people in wellness

35
0:02:02,500 --> 0:02:04,500
 who have stepped up to fill the void after him.

36
0:02:04,500 --> 0:02:06,500
 Thank you in particular

37
0:02:06,500 --> 0:02:09,500
 to the new radio team

38
0:02:09,500 --> 0:02:11,500
 and to Maunus,

39
0:02:11,500 --> 0:02:14,500
 who have sponsored the new radios

40
0:02:14,500 --> 0:02:16,500
 and the new repeater and everything,

41
0:02:16,500 --> 0:02:19,500
 so we can continue the work that Jesper did

42
0:02:19,500 --> 0:02:22,500
 in every sense of the word.

43
0:02:22,500 --> 0:02:27,500
 There's nothing really we can do to properly mark this,

44
0:02:27,500 --> 0:02:31,500
 but I wanted to do a minute of silence,

45
0:02:31,500 --> 0:02:33,500
 but instead, I think that doesn't feel right,

46
0:02:33,500 --> 0:02:37,500
 because Jesper wasn't the silent type.

47
0:02:37,500 --> 0:02:40,500
 Instead, we'll do 30 seconds of silence

48
0:02:40,500 --> 0:02:44,500
 and then 30 seconds of applause to celebrate his life.

49
0:02:44,500 --> 0:02:46,500
 Starting now.

50
0:02:52,500 --> 0:03:02,500
 .

51
0:03:02,500 --> 0:03:12,500
 .

52
0:03:12,500 --> 0:03:16,500
 .

53
0:03:16,500 --> 0:03:17,500
 .

54
0:03:17,500 --> 0:03:18,500
 .

55
0:03:18,500 --> 0:03:20,500
 .

56
0:03:20,500 --> 0:03:21,500
 .

57
0:03:21,500 --> 0:03:24,500
 .

58
0:03:24,500 --> 0:03:26,500
 .

59
0:03:26,500 --> 0:03:27,500
 .

60
0:03:27,500 --> 0:03:29,500
 .

61
0:03:29,500 --> 0:03:31,500
 .

62
0:03:31,500 --> 0:03:32,500
 .

63
0:03:32,500 --> 0:03:36,500
 .

64
0:03:36,500 --> 0:03:39,500
 .

65
0:03:39,500 --> 0:03:41,500
 .

66
0:03:41,500 --> 0:03:42,500
 .

67
0:03:42,500 --> 0:03:46,500
 .

68
0:03:46,500 --> 0:03:48,500
 .

69
0:03:48,500 --> 0:03:49,500
 .

70
0:03:49,500 --> 0:04:17,580
 Thank you all, it means a lot, give me 30 seconds.

71
0:04:17,580 --> 0:04:23,480
 It's not a fun first slide, but let's pick it up from here.

72
0:04:23,480 --> 0:04:28,260
 The code of conduct is pretty basic to BornHack, and it's actually one of the things that Jesper

73
0:04:28,260 --> 0:04:33,240
 also helped out a lot with, I forgot to mention that Morten from the NOC team stepped up and

74
0:04:33,240 --> 0:04:38,480
 took Jesper's place in the code of conduct team, so thank you also, Morten, for that.

75
0:04:38,480 --> 0:04:42,440
 The code of conduct, you probably have all seen it by now, because it's taped to the

76
0:04:42,440 --> 0:04:46,580
 inside of the toilet doors, so it's pretty hard to miss.

77
0:04:46,580 --> 0:04:47,580
 We take this seriously.

78
0:04:47,580 --> 0:04:49,600
 We expect you to do the same.

79
0:04:49,600 --> 0:04:55,480
 It is about being nice to each other and respecting each other's personal space.

80
0:04:55,480 --> 0:04:58,680
 It's a photo policy and much more.

81
0:04:58,680 --> 0:05:01,220
 Make sure you read it, make sure you follow it.

82
0:05:01,220 --> 0:05:07,520
 If you have questions, we are available, there's a conduct team that you can speak to, and

83
0:05:07,520 --> 0:05:14,520
 we usually don't have to resort to any major code of conduct things.

84
0:05:14,520 --> 0:05:16,940
 People are generally very, very nice to each other here.

85
0:05:16,940 --> 0:05:17,540
 We really appreciate it.

86
0:05:17,580 --> 0:05:23,040
 We appreciate that, and we think and hope that that will continue, of course, but the

87
0:05:23,040 --> 0:05:29,520
 code of conduct is there to be a guideline in case some people have questions about that.

88
0:05:29,520 --> 0:05:32,580
 Reach out to the conduct team, please.

89
0:05:32,580 --> 0:05:33,580
 Okay.

90
0:05:33,580 --> 0:05:44,800
 Like I said, everybody who some people even showed up on the first day or second day,

91
0:05:44,800 --> 0:05:45,700
 so have been here almost a week, along with the first officer.

92
0:05:45,700 --> 0:05:46,700
 I'm not sure if you can see the difference.

93
0:05:46,700 --> 0:05:46,900
 I'm not sure.

94
0:05:46,900 --> 0:05:46,980
 I'm not sure.

95
0:05:46,980 --> 0:05:47,040
 I'm not sure.

96
0:05:47,040 --> 0:05:47,120
 I'm not sure.

97
0:05:47,120 --> 0:05:47,220
 I'm not sure.

98
0:05:47,220 --> 0:05:47,260
 I'm not sure.

99
0:05:47,260 --> 0:05:47,280
 I'm not sure.

100
0:05:47,280 --> 0:05:47,360
 I'm not sure.

101
0:05:47,360 --> 0:05:47,380
 I'm not sure.

102
0:05:47,380 --> 0:05:47,400
 I'm not sure.

103
0:05:47,400 --> 0:05:47,420
 I'm not sure.

104
0:05:47,420 --> 0:05:47,460
 I'm not sure.

105
0:05:47,460 --> 0:05:47,520
 I'm not sure.

106
0:05:47,580 --> 0:05:47,980
 I'm not sure.

107
0:05:47,980 --> 0:05:48,040
 I'm not sure.

108
0:05:48,040 --> 0:05:48,120
 I'm not sure.

109
0:05:48,120 --> 0:05:48,140
 I'm not sure.

110
0:05:48,140 --> 0:05:48,160
 I'm not sure.

111
0:05:48,160 --> 0:05:48,500
 I'm not sure.

112
0:05:48,500 --> 0:05:48,520
 I'm not sure.

113
0:05:48,520 --> 0:05:48,560
 I'm not sure.

114
0:05:48,560 --> 0:05:48,580
 I'm not sure.

115
0:05:48,580 --> 0:05:48,600
 I'm not sure.

116
0:05:48,600 --> 0:05:48,640
 I'm not sure.

117
0:05:49,100 --> 0:05:54,840
 It is such a big job putting up all this stuff, and the rain has not, the weather

118
0:05:54,840 --> 0:05:56,460
 has not helped one bit.

119
0:05:56,760 --> 0:06:02,020
 It has been not only raining, but very unstable, so occasionally raining and occasionally very

120
0:06:02,020 --> 0:06:06,680
 hot, so you have to change in and out of outfits every 10 seconds.

121
0:06:06,860 --> 0:06:11,600
 There's been a lot of work, and to the people who take extra days off of work and stuff

122
0:06:11,600 --> 0:06:15,580
 to come and help make this happen, and also in the other end who stay for the teardown

123
0:06:15,580 --> 0:06:17,560
 and extra space.

124
0:06:17,560 --> 0:06:18,900
 Rachel, a big thank you.

125
0:06:19,020 --> 0:06:23,900
 Can you please all stand up, people who helped with the build-up, so we can see how many people

126
0:06:23,900 --> 0:06:24,600
 there actually is?

127
0:06:44,600 --> 0:06:44,960
 Thank you.

128
0:06:44,960 --> 0:06:47,440
 Born Hackers, like the bar, always a work in progress.

129
0:06:47,440 --> 0:06:56,620
 Even though we have had a bit more of a less stressful build-up because we had a few more

130
0:06:56,620 --> 0:07:02,380
 days and some stuff got delivered and put up earlier than usual, so it's been a nice example

131
0:07:02,380 --> 0:07:06,220
 of a build-up the way it should be and not too stressful and not too many long nights

132
0:07:06,220 --> 0:07:11,160
 and stuff, but it would be crazy to think that we have remembered everything and gotten

133
0:07:11,160 --> 0:07:15,500
 everything done, so there's still small things to do, and there'll be stuff that keeps popping

134
0:07:15,500 --> 0:07:16,420
 up over the week.

135
0:07:17,440 --> 0:07:24,160
 We'll put jobs on the whiteboard by the info desk, so if you come by and see something and

136
0:07:24,160 --> 0:07:28,820
 think, I can do that, and I have some time and I want to help out, then by all means,

137
0:07:28,820 --> 0:07:35,420
 please talk to the info desk or somebody if you need to, or just do the job if it's easy

138
0:07:35,420 --> 0:07:39,020
 to do.

139
0:07:39,020 --> 0:07:41,900
 If you see something wrong and you can't fix it, then please let us know.

140
0:07:41,900 --> 0:07:44,480
 We will find somebody who can fix it.

141
0:07:44,480 --> 0:07:47,240
 I have a venue map.

142
0:07:47,240 --> 0:07:54,860
 At some point, and the venue continually evolving over the week is exemplified by, I made these

143
0:07:54,860 --> 0:07:59,620
 slides two hours ago and the map is already outdated, so bear with me on that.

144
0:07:59,620 --> 0:08:04,560
 I'll try to explain what happened when we get to it, but we're rolling with the punches

145
0:08:04,560 --> 0:08:08,820
 and we'll make everything work, of course.

146
0:08:08,820 --> 0:08:09,980
 Oh, here it is.

147
0:08:09,980 --> 0:08:11,820
 It's not terribly big, but...

148
0:08:11,820 --> 0:08:12,820
 Yeah, okay.

149
0:08:12,820 --> 0:08:13,820
 It's not terribly big.

150
0:08:13,820 --> 0:08:14,820
 It's not terribly big.

151
0:08:14,820 --> 0:08:15,820
 It's not terribly big.

152
0:08:15,820 --> 0:08:16,820
 It's not terribly big.

153
0:08:16,820 --> 0:08:17,820
 It's not terribly big.

154
0:08:17,820 --> 0:08:18,820
 It's not terribly big.

155
0:08:18,820 --> 0:08:19,820
 Okay.

156
0:08:19,820 --> 0:08:20,820
 So...

157
0:08:20,820 --> 0:08:23,820
 Well, I'll just use the colors.

158
0:08:23,820 --> 0:08:24,820
 Okay.

159
0:08:24,820 --> 0:08:31,640
 So we are in the white square in the middle of the light blue triangle, the general camping,

160
0:08:31,640 --> 0:08:35,240
 and this is the speaker stand.

161
0:08:35,240 --> 0:08:37,060
 Across the road, straight ahead is the bar.

162
0:08:37,060 --> 0:08:38,060
 It is hard to miss.

163
0:08:38,060 --> 0:08:42,820
 It is a big, colorful, loud place with all the beers.

164
0:08:42,820 --> 0:08:46,440
 We have northeast of this general camping.

165
0:08:46,440 --> 0:08:48,440
 In the pointy end, we have the caravans.

166
0:08:48,440 --> 0:08:54,200
 This year, they moved to the other side of the road, and across the road from them, we

167
0:08:54,200 --> 0:08:57,440
 have some more general camping for our tents.

168
0:08:57,440 --> 0:09:03,440
 On the other, between the bar and general camping is the orga area with the info desk

169
0:09:03,440 --> 0:09:04,440
 and all that.

170
0:09:04,440 --> 0:09:10,440
 It is also the organizer's personal village and where we go to chill out and get away

171
0:09:10,440 --> 0:09:15,440
 from people, like everybody needs to occasionally.

172
0:09:15,440 --> 0:09:21,440
 So, please, unless you have something urgent, try to reach somebody in the info desk or

173
0:09:21,440 --> 0:09:28,440
 somewhere else, and please stay out of the orga village as much as possible.

174
0:09:28,440 --> 0:09:33,940
 Not that we don't love you all, but we also have our stock of booze and everything in

175
0:09:33,940 --> 0:09:34,940
 there.

176
0:09:34,940 --> 0:09:37,440
 We want to just keep it free of people.

177
0:09:37,440 --> 0:09:42,440
 That is for us to drink.

178
0:09:42,440 --> 0:09:43,440
 No.

179
0:09:43,440 --> 0:09:44,440
 Yeah.

180
0:09:44,440 --> 0:09:54,440
 So, following the central main road south, there's an entrance into the food area, and

181
0:09:54,440 --> 0:09:58,440
 past the food area, there's the noisy camping area.

182
0:09:58,440 --> 0:10:00,440
 Sorry, party camping area.

183
0:10:00,440 --> 0:10:04,440
 You don't have to be noisy down there.

184
0:10:04,440 --> 0:10:08,440
 On the other side of the road from that is the cozy camping area, which we introduced

185
0:10:08,440 --> 0:10:11,440
 last year when we moved the speaker's tent down here.

186
0:10:11,440 --> 0:10:13,440
 It has turned out to be quite a nice little camping area.

187
0:10:13,440 --> 0:10:15,440
 It's very popular this year.

188
0:10:15,440 --> 0:10:16,440
 It's nice to see.

189
0:10:16,440 --> 0:10:21,440
 Going further up the road, there's a big shower and toilet building.

190
0:10:21,440 --> 0:10:25,440
 All the showers are down in the south end of the venue.

191
0:10:25,440 --> 0:10:29,440
 There's a separate building that has two showers and four toilets, and inside the main building,

192
0:10:29,440 --> 0:10:32,440
 there's two more showers and two more toilets.

193
0:10:32,440 --> 0:10:35,440
 Also, there's two toilets down here by the bar.

194
0:10:35,440 --> 0:10:37,440
 That's the venue.

195
0:10:37,440 --> 0:10:39,440
 If you have questions...

196
0:10:39,440 --> 0:10:41,440
 Oh, and the silent area, the neon light bulb.

197
0:10:41,440 --> 0:10:42,440
 No.

198
0:10:42,440 --> 0:10:48,440
 The light blue area in the top is the silent camping, and the eastern part of that, or

199
0:10:48,440 --> 0:10:52,440
 maybe the western part, it's not fully clear yet, will be converted to an extra caravan

200
0:10:52,440 --> 0:10:55,440
 area, because we're kind of running out of space.

201
0:10:55,440 --> 0:11:03,440
 There's ample space down there, so we'll kind of remodel the venue a little bit last minute,

202
0:11:03,440 --> 0:11:04,440
 forced by...

203
0:11:04,440 --> 0:11:10,440
 Well, we kind of estimated wrong, I think, how much room caravans take or something.

204
0:11:10,440 --> 0:11:11,440
 Okay.

205
0:11:11,440 --> 0:11:14,440
 The info desk is across the road from...

206
0:11:14,440 --> 0:11:17,440
 Yeah, and a bit down the road from where we are now.

207
0:11:17,440 --> 0:11:20,440
 Many of you have probably been there to get your wristband.

208
0:11:20,440 --> 0:11:25,440
 You can come back to get more hacks, get some mate if the bar isn't open, ask questions,

209
0:11:25,440 --> 0:11:29,440
 pick up merchandise, pick up the badges when we get to that.

210
0:11:29,440 --> 0:11:34,440
 They will be ready soon, I think, tomorrow or the day after or something.

211
0:11:34,440 --> 0:11:37,440
 The team needs people to help cover the shifts.

212
0:11:37,440 --> 0:11:39,440
 It's not difficult work.

213
0:11:39,440 --> 0:11:44,440
 They sit down and just help people, and they have a thorough introduction, so most people

214
0:11:44,440 --> 0:11:46,440
 should be able to do it.

215
0:11:46,440 --> 0:11:51,440
 They really need some help, so please go to the info desk and ask them if you're interested

216
0:11:51,440 --> 0:11:52,440
 in helping out.

217
0:11:52,440 --> 0:11:57,440
 They would love to be able to cover the shifts without having to work all of them all the

218
0:11:57,440 --> 0:11:58,440
 time.

219
0:11:58,440 --> 0:12:06,440
 For those of you who haven't been here before, we have something called Hacks.

220
0:12:06,440 --> 0:12:07,440
 You might have heard about it already.

221
0:12:07,440 --> 0:12:08,440
 It is our internal...

222
0:12:08,440 --> 0:12:11,440
 It is our internal local currency.

223
0:12:11,440 --> 0:12:16,440
 We packed it to the Danish Krona, so it is worth the same as Danish Krona.

224
0:12:16,440 --> 0:12:21,440
 If something costs 150 hacks, it is the same as 150 Danish Krona.

225
0:12:21,440 --> 0:12:26,440
 They can be bought at the info desk or at the bar when the bar is open, or you can buy

226
0:12:26,440 --> 0:12:31,440
 them online and just buy them on the web shop and use the ticket in the bar or the info

227
0:12:31,440 --> 0:12:32,440
 desk.

228
0:12:32,440 --> 0:12:35,440
 You can also use them at the food...

229
0:12:35,440 --> 0:12:37,440
 Apart from the info desk and the bar, the food vendor accepts them.

230
0:12:37,440 --> 0:12:47,440
 They can basically be used like real money, except the only way to buy alcohol is with

231
0:12:47,440 --> 0:12:48,440
 hacks.

232
0:12:48,440 --> 0:12:53,440
 You cannot buy it with real money, which is the main reason we have them.

233
0:12:53,440 --> 0:12:54,440
 You will need...

234
0:12:54,440 --> 0:12:57,440
 If you want to go to the bar and buy anything with any kind of alcohol in it, you will need

235
0:12:57,440 --> 0:12:59,440
 to go get some hacks in the info desk to do that.

236
0:12:59,440 --> 0:13:01,440
 They are these little...

237
0:13:01,440 --> 0:13:03,440
 We haven't even gotten any yet.

238
0:13:03,440 --> 0:13:04,440
 Little colored coins.

239
0:13:04,440 --> 0:13:05,440
 You will see them everywhere.

240
0:13:05,440 --> 0:13:06,440
 Thank you.

241
0:13:06,440 --> 0:13:07,440
 Thank you.

242
0:13:07,440 --> 0:13:08,440
 Thank you very much.

243
0:13:08,440 --> 0:13:09,440
 Thank you.

244
0:13:09,440 --> 0:13:10,440
 Okay.

245
0:13:10,440 --> 0:13:17,440
 If you order village tents or tables and chairs and stuff, the tents you probably found,

246
0:13:17,440 --> 0:13:20,440
 tables and chairs, if you still need to get that, you can go to the info desk.

247
0:13:20,440 --> 0:13:22,440
 Please coordinate with the info desk.

248
0:13:22,440 --> 0:13:26,440
 Don't just take stuff, because then we have no chance to keep track of it.

249
0:13:26,440 --> 0:13:27,440
 It is not logged in.

250
0:13:27,440 --> 0:13:30,440
 We know you can just walk up and take it, and we know you have paid for it and stuff,

251
0:13:30,440 --> 0:13:32,440
 but please coordinate with us.

252
0:13:32,440 --> 0:13:35,440
 It is really tricky to keep track of stuff when people just take it.

253
0:13:35,440 --> 0:13:38,440
 Don't just take it and tell us in the bar at 1 a.m.

254
0:13:38,440 --> 0:13:41,440
 I took two chairs and four tables.

255
0:13:41,440 --> 0:13:47,440
 So please go do it properly in the info desk when they are open.

256
0:13:47,440 --> 0:13:51,440
 We may have a few extra tables and chairs and benches.

257
0:13:51,440 --> 0:13:55,440
 Go by info tomorrow and check if we have any surplus.

258
0:13:55,440 --> 0:14:02,440
 If you forgot to order, you will need some extras.

259
0:14:02,440 --> 0:14:04,440
 We have electricity all over the venue.

260
0:14:04,440 --> 0:14:06,440
 Thanks to the hard-working power team.

261
0:14:06,440 --> 0:14:11,440
 They have rolled out more than a kilometre of the very heavy cables.

262
0:14:11,440 --> 0:14:16,440
 And the power points are more or less all over the venue.

263
0:14:16,440 --> 0:14:22,440
 Please keep them covered from the rain so we don't have any outages because something got wet.

264
0:14:22,440 --> 0:14:27,440
 And if you see one without cover, please fix it yourself or notify somebody who can fix it.

265
0:14:27,440 --> 0:14:31,440
 Please don't just ignore it and leave it and think somebody else will do it.

266
0:14:31,440 --> 0:14:33,440
 Let everybody help out.

267
0:14:33,440 --> 0:14:38,440
 And things will get fixed much quicker and stop from breaking.

268
0:14:38,440 --> 0:14:41,440
 There's an example here.

269
0:14:41,440 --> 0:14:43,440
 It is not the biggest picture.

270
0:14:43,440 --> 0:14:46,440
 But a happy-looking power point.

271
0:14:46,440 --> 0:14:48,440
 It has a bag over it.

272
0:14:48,440 --> 0:14:53,440
 And the bag is secured with some pegs in the back.

273
0:14:53,440 --> 0:14:55,440
 Or what are they called?

274
0:14:55,440 --> 0:14:56,440
 Yeah.

275
0:14:56,440 --> 0:14:59,440
 Some secured in the back.

276
0:14:59,440 --> 0:15:01,440
 It is cloth pegs.

277
0:15:01,440 --> 0:15:02,440
 Yeah.

278
0:15:02,440 --> 0:15:03,440
 Cloth pegs.

279
0:15:03,440 --> 0:15:04,440
 Okay.

280
0:15:04,440 --> 0:15:09,440
 Connect your cables if you need an adaptor because we don't have...

281
0:15:09,440 --> 0:15:12,440
 We have the weird Danish standard here.

282
0:15:12,440 --> 0:15:14,440
 Maybe we have some...

283
0:15:14,440 --> 0:15:16,440
 Do we have some in the info desk or not?

284
0:15:16,440 --> 0:15:17,440
 I don't know actually.

285
0:15:17,440 --> 0:15:19,440
 Ask somebody who knows.

286
0:15:21,440 --> 0:15:22,440
 We don't.

287
0:15:22,440 --> 0:15:24,440
 Well...

288
0:15:24,440 --> 0:15:25,440
 Yeah.

289
0:15:25,440 --> 0:15:26,440
 We'll figure it out.

290
0:15:26,440 --> 0:15:30,440
 Come ask us if you can't get power because things don't fit.

291
0:15:30,440 --> 0:15:32,440
 We'll make it fit somehow.

292
0:15:39,440 --> 0:15:43,440
 Along the same lines, the network team have been working hard to get the network up and running.

293
0:15:43,440 --> 0:15:47,440
 You can get gigabit Ethernet to your table.

294
0:15:47,440 --> 0:15:48,440
 You can get Wi-Fi.

295
0:15:48,440 --> 0:15:53,440
 You can even get a fiber blink if you arrange it especially with the network team.

296
0:15:53,440 --> 0:15:59,440
 So if you have special needs other than Wi-Fi, you can absolutely get that sorted.

297
0:15:59,440 --> 0:16:01,440
 We have three SSIDs.

298
0:16:01,440 --> 0:16:08,440
 The bornhack NAT is the one that acts mostly like a home Internet connection.

299
0:16:08,440 --> 0:16:14,440
 The bornhack 802.1X is with 802.1X authentication, funnily enough.

300
0:16:14,440 --> 0:16:23,440
 And the IPv6 one is with the modern IP family without the legacy IPv4 one.

301
0:16:23,440 --> 0:16:28,440
 We get constant requests to use more bandwidth and I guess that applies this year as well.

302
0:16:28,440 --> 0:16:29,440
 Does it?

303
0:16:29,440 --> 0:16:30,440
 Knock team?

304
0:16:30,440 --> 0:16:31,440
 Yes.

305
0:16:32,440 --> 0:16:33,440
 Great.

306
0:16:33,440 --> 0:16:38,440
 So please use more bandwidth.

307
0:16:38,440 --> 0:16:41,440
 The bar, as you can see, is progressing nicely.

308
0:16:41,440 --> 0:16:47,440
 It is always fascinating even to, I think, even to the people building it, how it's going to look.

309
0:16:47,440 --> 0:16:58,440
 But to everybody watching it during buildup and in the first days, so much happens and it becomes increasingly more awesome as the days go by.

310
0:16:58,440 --> 0:16:59,440
 Please use the bar.

311
0:16:59,440 --> 0:17:07,440
 It is an important part of the money that we use to make this event work, especially this year.

312
0:17:07,440 --> 0:17:14,440
 We've had a few sponsors fall off, fall away, and it's been difficult to make ends meet.

313
0:17:14,440 --> 0:17:16,440
 So we've had to cut a few things.

314
0:17:16,440 --> 0:17:19,440
 The hot tub, for example, is not here this year.

315
0:17:19,440 --> 0:17:26,440
 Very sad to say, but we had to make some difficult cuts here and there, and that was one of the things that we had to take away.

316
0:17:26,440 --> 0:17:27,440
 We hope it will be better.

317
0:17:27,440 --> 0:17:29,440
 We hope it will be back next year.

318
0:17:29,440 --> 0:17:31,440
 But please use the bar.

319
0:17:31,440 --> 0:17:37,440
 We absolutely depend on the profits from the bar to make this whole thing work.

320
0:17:37,440 --> 0:17:46,440
 We have a very nice selection of craft beer and booze and can make cocktails, and there's all the mate in the world.

321
0:17:46,440 --> 0:17:52,440
 We might have slightly overdone it on the mate this year, so please.

322
0:17:57,440 --> 0:18:07,440
 There's many, many kinds and many, many bottles of each kind, so that's great.

323
0:18:07,440 --> 0:18:15,440
 The bar has closing hours.

324
0:18:15,440 --> 0:18:20,440
 We have a permit to sell booze from the authorities, and that ends at 2 a.m. every night.

325
0:18:20,440 --> 0:18:23,440
 So there's last rounds at 1.50.

326
0:18:23,440 --> 0:18:25,440
 Get your purchases in there.

327
0:18:25,440 --> 0:18:26,440
 Get in line.

328
0:18:26,440 --> 0:18:30,440
 Get in line, because we have to stop selling alcohol.

329
0:18:30,440 --> 0:18:36,440
 And the bar doesn't necessarily have to shut down entirely, but we cannot sell any more alcohol.

330
0:18:36,440 --> 0:18:43,440
 So buy your bottles and stuff before 2, and then stick around.

331
0:18:43,440 --> 0:18:45,440
 When does it reopen?

332
0:18:45,440 --> 0:18:54,440
 Well, I mean...

333
0:18:54,440 --> 0:18:57,440
 That is thinking like a hacker.

334
0:18:57,440 --> 0:19:06,440
 No, we better not play games with them, but, yeah, it opens when the first bar staff wakes up the next day.

335
0:19:06,440 --> 0:19:09,440
 Usually around noon-ish, I would say.

336
0:19:09,440 --> 0:19:13,440
 So, yeah.

337
0:19:13,440 --> 0:19:16,440
 Okay.

338
0:19:16,440 --> 0:19:22,440
 When we are a lot of people gathered, we generate a lot of trash that is inevitable,

339
0:19:22,440 --> 0:19:25,440
 from food and drinks and everything.

340
0:19:25,440 --> 0:19:31,440
 And it is a lot of work handling trash from just a few hundred people like we are,

341
0:19:31,440 --> 0:19:36,440
 generates so much trash and so much deposit, like empty bottles and cans and stuff,

342
0:19:36,440 --> 0:19:42,440
 that we need to handle it properly from the beginning to not generate massive amounts of work.

343
0:19:42,440 --> 0:19:51,440
 And also, if it's not handled properly, we get wasps and a thousand nasty things as a result of not handling trash properly.

344
0:19:52,440 --> 0:19:57,440
 So, we have some trash cans around, and there are signs on them.

345
0:19:57,440 --> 0:20:02,440
 Please look at the signs before you put stuff in, so you use the correct trash cans.

346
0:20:02,440 --> 0:20:05,440
 We have five different ones.

347
0:20:05,440 --> 0:20:09,440
 Two of them are for deposits.

348
0:20:09,440 --> 0:20:11,440
 They have this circular logo thing.

349
0:20:11,440 --> 0:20:13,440
 It's on the trash cans as well.

350
0:20:13,440 --> 0:20:17,440
 And if the bottles have that, you know the system from wherever you live.

351
0:20:17,440 --> 0:20:21,440
 And the deposit cans and plastic bottles go in one container.

352
0:20:21,440 --> 0:20:25,440
 And the deposit glass bottles go in another container.

353
0:20:25,440 --> 0:20:31,440
 Apart from that, there's a glass container for just booze glass bottles or whatever glass that doesn't have deposit.

354
0:20:31,440 --> 0:20:33,440
 And one for cardboard.

355
0:20:33,440 --> 0:20:38,440
 And finally, one that doesn't fit for all the trash that doesn't fit in any of the others.

356
0:20:38,440 --> 0:20:40,440
 Is that pretty clear?

357
0:20:40,440 --> 0:20:42,440
 Two different kinds of deposit.

358
0:20:42,440 --> 0:20:43,440
 One for cans and plastic bottles.

359
0:20:43,440 --> 0:20:44,440
 One for glass.

360
0:20:44,440 --> 0:20:47,440
 And then there's glass, cardboard, and the rest.

361
0:20:47,440 --> 0:20:48,440
 Okay?

362
0:20:48,440 --> 0:20:49,440
 Fantastic.

363
0:20:49,440 --> 0:20:51,440
 The people sorting it at the end.

364
0:20:51,440 --> 0:20:58,440
 It will send you happy thoughts forever if you don't generate too much sorting.

365
0:20:58,440 --> 0:21:06,440
 As you can imagine, sorting 300-400 people's deposit after a week or two is not fun work.

366
0:21:06,440 --> 0:21:12,440
 So the less stuff that has been put in wrong, the less we have to sort, the better.

367
0:21:12,440 --> 0:21:15,440
 So please spend the extra ten seconds.

368
0:21:15,440 --> 0:21:16,440
 Check the signs.

369
0:21:16,440 --> 0:21:17,440
 Put it in properly.

370
0:21:17,440 --> 0:21:20,440
 And please and thank you from the sanitation team.

371
0:21:21,440 --> 0:21:22,440
 Thank you.

372
0:21:22,440 --> 0:21:23,440
 Yes?

373
0:21:23,440 --> 0:21:24,440
 What about plastic?

374
0:21:24,440 --> 0:21:25,440
 Plastic what?

375
0:21:25,440 --> 0:21:26,440
 Just general plastic.

376
0:21:26,440 --> 0:21:27,440
 Yeah.

377
0:21:27,440 --> 0:21:33,440
 In this municipality, they haven't joined the rest of us in the 21st century.

378
0:21:33,440 --> 0:21:36,440
 So it's not going to fix this issue?

379
0:21:36,440 --> 0:21:37,440
 No, absolutely not.

380
0:21:37,440 --> 0:21:38,440
 No, no.

381
0:21:38,440 --> 0:21:40,440
 We would sort in ten kinds if we could.

382
0:21:40,440 --> 0:21:43,440
 But they are just going to mix it all together when they pick it up anyway.

383
0:21:43,440 --> 0:21:45,440
 So there's no reason.

384
0:21:45,440 --> 0:21:46,440
 Sadly.

385
0:21:46,440 --> 0:21:50,440
 We hope next year we come back and see ten trash cans outside.

386
0:21:50,440 --> 0:21:52,440
 But we've been hoping that for four years now.

387
0:21:52,440 --> 0:21:54,440
 Let's see when it happens.

388
0:21:54,440 --> 0:21:55,440
 Thank you.

389
0:21:55,440 --> 0:21:56,440
 Sure.

390
0:21:56,440 --> 0:21:59,440
 Good question, though.

391
0:21:59,440 --> 0:22:00,440
 OK.

392
0:22:00,440 --> 0:22:05,440
 Like I mentioned, we've had a rough time of it with sponsors this year.

393
0:22:05,440 --> 0:22:09,440
 But we have managed to find some new sponsors.

394
0:22:09,440 --> 0:22:14,440
 And we are, of course, always tremendously grateful for all the support we are getting.

395
0:22:14,440 --> 0:22:19,440
 Some sponsors pay cash and help just with the general finances of the event.

396
0:22:20,440 --> 0:22:24,440
 Some lenders stuff that we would otherwise have to spend money on getting, which is

397
0:22:24,440 --> 0:22:27,440
 just as good as getting money.

398
0:22:27,440 --> 0:22:29,440
 And it all helps out.

399
0:22:29,440 --> 0:22:37,440
 And even small sponsors that may not be big companies and can't put in that much, it all

400
0:22:37,440 --> 0:22:38,440
 helps.

401
0:22:38,440 --> 0:22:44,440
 Because I'd much rather have five small sponsors than one big one if the amount is the same,

402
0:22:44,440 --> 0:22:48,440
 because it's just nicer.

403
0:22:48,440 --> 0:22:55,440
 So to all the sponsors, big and small, thank you to all the people who jumped in when the

404
0:22:55,440 --> 0:22:57,440
 shit hit the fan.

405
0:22:57,440 --> 0:23:00,440
 And we really needed to find new sponsors on pretty short notice.

406
0:23:00,440 --> 0:23:05,440
 Thank you all for jumping in to assist me and the others on the sponsors team and coming

407
0:23:05,440 --> 0:23:06,440
 with new leads.

408
0:23:06,440 --> 0:23:11,440
 If any of you have an idea for an organization that might want to help, please send them

409
0:23:11,440 --> 0:23:14,440
 my way or towards the sponsors' email.

410
0:23:14,440 --> 0:23:16,440
 And we can reach out to them.

411
0:23:16,440 --> 0:23:17,440
 Thank you.

412
0:23:17,440 --> 0:23:24,440
 The absolute most successful way to do it is if you know somebody who can make the decision

413
0:23:24,440 --> 0:23:29,440
 about giving some money or not and prepare them and then put us in contact with them.

414
0:23:29,440 --> 0:23:33,440
 That method has close to 100% success rate.

415
0:23:33,440 --> 0:23:38,440
 And just getting a contact, call this dude and this company, has a close to 0% success

416
0:23:38,440 --> 0:23:39,440
 rate.

417
0:23:39,440 --> 0:23:41,440
 It is a massive difference.

418
0:23:41,440 --> 0:23:45,440
 So if you know somebody, can go poke your boss and say, hey, we should pay 10,000 to

419
0:23:45,440 --> 0:23:46,440
 this event next year.

420
0:23:46,440 --> 0:23:49,440
 Because they are really cool and they help the community a lot and such and such.

421
0:23:49,440 --> 0:23:50,440
 It helps us a lot.

422
0:23:50,440 --> 0:23:56,440
 And it's barely any money in a company's budget for the whole year.

423
0:23:56,440 --> 0:24:01,440
 Almost no matter how small a company, except ours.

424
0:24:01,440 --> 0:24:05,440
 So thank you to all of you who helped find sponsors.

425
0:24:05,440 --> 0:24:06,440
 I'll go through them now.

426
0:24:06,440 --> 0:24:09,440
 And there will be their logos on the website and everything.

427
0:24:09,440 --> 0:24:14,440
 We have a small paper with the badges this year that also have the sponsors' logo on

428
0:24:14,440 --> 0:24:15,440
 them.

429
0:24:15,440 --> 0:24:22,440
 Please send them your thanks and thoughts and use their services if you at all can.

430
0:24:22,440 --> 0:24:27,440
 The big ones this year are DKNOCK, which is another event.

431
0:24:27,440 --> 0:24:30,440
 And they're full of lovely networking people.

432
0:24:30,440 --> 0:24:35,440
 And they stepped in when they heard we were struggling and helped out a fellow event.

433
0:24:35,440 --> 0:24:41,440
 Samdata is a big labor union in Denmark that, among other things, has...

434
0:24:41,440 --> 0:24:43,440
 HK is a big labor union.

435
0:24:43,440 --> 0:24:50,440
 Samdata is the IT department for IT people.

436
0:24:50,440 --> 0:24:56,440
 And Zebra Group is my employer that has lots of companies, among others the one where I'm

437
0:24:56,440 --> 0:24:58,440
 employed called MindFuture.

438
0:25:10,440 --> 0:25:11,440
 Silver sponsors.

439
0:25:11,440 --> 0:25:16,440
 Epson has, for the fourth year in a row, I think, sponsored this very nice video setup

440
0:25:16,440 --> 0:25:23,440
 with a high intensity brightness projector that works even when the sun is shining and

441
0:25:23,440 --> 0:25:25,440
 the weather is sweet.

442
0:25:25,440 --> 0:25:27,440
 So thank you for that.

443
0:25:27,440 --> 0:25:30,440
 And that's a good example of something we would otherwise have to go out and rent.

444
0:25:30,440 --> 0:25:33,440
 And they are very expensive.

445
0:25:33,440 --> 0:25:36,440
 Jobindex and CIMA4 are both new sponsors.

446
0:25:36,440 --> 0:25:38,440
 And thank you to those as well.

447
0:25:41,440 --> 0:25:53,440
 Among the sponsors are also Bornholm Spirits, who continue to supply.

448
0:25:53,440 --> 0:25:57,440
 We started out at Bornholm, but they continue to supply SaberBlurter and other nice things

449
0:25:57,440 --> 0:25:59,440
 for us at a very nice price.

450
0:25:59,440 --> 0:26:05,440
 Feebaboo is providing the internet connection, not the fiber, but the actual uplink to the

451
0:26:05,440 --> 0:26:06,440
 internet.

452
0:26:06,440 --> 0:26:10,440
 Magenta, PCBWay, are sponsoring the...

453
0:26:10,440 --> 0:26:12,440
 The PCBs for the badges.

454
0:26:12,440 --> 0:26:14,440
 And Raymion are sponsoring speakers.

455
0:26:14,440 --> 0:26:22,440
 And Roskilde Auto and Skade Center is sponsoring the shuttle car.

456
0:26:22,440 --> 0:26:24,440
 And the rest are financial...

457
0:26:24,440 --> 0:26:28,440
 No, TukTek is hosting, sponsor for the Bornhack stuff.

458
0:26:28,440 --> 0:26:30,440
 And the rest are financial sponsors.

459
0:26:30,440 --> 0:26:32,440
 And thank you so much to them.

460
0:26:40,440 --> 0:26:44,440
 There's a full year now until the next Bornhack.

461
0:26:44,440 --> 0:26:48,440
 And a lot of this sponsor stuff takes some months to settle.

462
0:26:48,440 --> 0:26:52,440
 And it's really tricky to do two weeks before Bornhack.

463
0:26:52,440 --> 0:26:58,440
 So if you have an idea, get started in the start of next year, not in June or July.

464
0:26:58,440 --> 0:27:03,440
 Because it might be too late for decision-makers have gone on holiday and everything.

465
0:27:03,440 --> 0:27:08,440
 So spring is a good time to be thinking about sponsors for Bornhack.

466
0:27:10,440 --> 0:27:13,440
 Oh, that's quite the segue.

467
0:27:13,440 --> 0:27:18,440
 So we are in an area that sometimes has...

468
0:27:18,440 --> 0:27:20,440
 Well, all the time has ticks.

469
0:27:20,440 --> 0:27:28,440
 And sometimes they latch onto people and sit down by the angles or in humid places on the body.

470
0:27:28,440 --> 0:27:29,440
 They are nasty.

471
0:27:29,440 --> 0:27:33,440
 They can sometimes rarely but occasionally have a disease.

472
0:27:33,440 --> 0:27:36,440
 And it can infect people and can get really nasty.

473
0:27:36,440 --> 0:27:39,440
 So if you discover a tick, get it removed as soon as possible.

474
0:27:39,440 --> 0:27:42,440
 We have tick removers in the info desk.

475
0:27:42,440 --> 0:27:45,440
 And SIRT can help remove them.

476
0:27:45,440 --> 0:27:47,440
 It can be difficult to check.

477
0:27:47,440 --> 0:27:50,440
 Like it's the back of the knees and weird places.

478
0:27:50,440 --> 0:27:52,440
 Have a friend help you in the tent.

479
0:27:52,440 --> 0:27:53,440
 It might be fun.

480
0:28:04,440 --> 0:28:07,440
 And make sure you check when you're in the shower.

481
0:28:07,440 --> 0:28:09,440
 And if you feel that might be a problem,

482
0:28:09,440 --> 0:28:11,440
 they are very, very small.

483
0:28:11,440 --> 0:28:13,440
 They can look like just a little piece of dirt.

484
0:28:13,440 --> 0:28:16,440
 Some of them are incredibly tiny.

485
0:28:16,440 --> 0:28:23,440
 So, yeah, make sure you keep an eye out for those little fuckers.

486
0:28:23,440 --> 0:28:24,440
 Okay.

487
0:28:24,440 --> 0:28:25,440
 Bicycles.

488
0:28:25,440 --> 0:28:30,440
 The info desk is the place to go if you need to ride a bike somewhere.

489
0:28:30,440 --> 0:28:36,440
 Maybe go shopping or maybe just go for a nice ride around in nature or whatever you need.

490
0:28:36,440 --> 0:28:38,440
 We have helmets and locks and lights and stuff for them.

491
0:28:38,440 --> 0:28:40,440
 Different sizes.

492
0:28:40,440 --> 0:28:42,440
 There's a few children's bikes too.

493
0:28:42,440 --> 0:28:44,440
 And there's a trailer or two as well.

494
0:28:44,440 --> 0:28:46,440
 They are free still.

495
0:28:46,440 --> 0:28:50,440
 This is one of the things we considered introducing a payment for when we were,

496
0:28:50,440 --> 0:28:53,440
 because we are struggling a bit financially.

497
0:28:53,440 --> 0:28:56,440
 Instead, we suggest a small donation to cover the cost.

498
0:28:56,440 --> 0:28:58,440
 But there's no, they are free.

499
0:28:58,440 --> 0:29:02,440
 But please consider donating something if you take a bike.

500
0:29:05,440 --> 0:29:06,440
 The parking lot.

501
0:29:06,440 --> 0:29:07,440
 Most of you arrived by car.

502
0:29:07,440 --> 0:29:10,440
 So you will have noticed the parking lot.

503
0:29:10,440 --> 0:29:14,440
 I just wanted to mention, please park sensibly.

504
0:29:14,440 --> 0:29:20,440
 And, like, don't, it goes without saying, don't double park and don't park so other people can't get out.

505
0:29:20,440 --> 0:29:25,440
 There's plenty of room down there for all the tickets we sold if people park sensibly.

506
0:29:25,440 --> 0:29:34,440
 So last year we had a, no, two years ago, an annoying incident where we had to run around and find somebody who was parked so other people couldn't get out.

507
0:29:34,440 --> 0:29:36,440
 So please consider everybody when you get out.

508
0:29:36,440 --> 0:29:39,440
 Everybody when you put your car down.

509
0:29:39,440 --> 0:29:43,440
 If there's any issues in the parking lot, please notify the info desk.

510
0:29:43,440 --> 0:29:49,440
 We don't necessarily know because we're not, not all of us are driving around.

511
0:29:49,440 --> 0:29:52,440
 We arrive here and then we leave two weeks later.

512
0:29:52,440 --> 0:29:54,440
 So we might not notice.

513
0:29:54,440 --> 0:30:01,440
 So please notify us if there's something with the driving plates or someone is parked badly or something.

514
0:30:06,440 --> 0:30:13,440
 If you ordered T-shirts, hoodies, and merchandise, it will be produced during the week.

515
0:30:13,440 --> 0:30:19,440
 And when it's ready, we'll announce it and you can pick it up in the info desk.

516
0:30:19,440 --> 0:30:22,440
 It is being produced by, yeah, and a few other volunteers.

517
0:30:22,440 --> 0:30:24,440
 We're doing a lot of work for it.

518
0:30:24,440 --> 0:30:27,440
 And it's always such nice merchandise we get.

519
0:30:27,440 --> 0:30:34,440
 So thank you for all the work you're doing.

520
0:30:34,440 --> 0:30:35,440
 Oh.

521
0:30:35,440 --> 0:30:38,440
 Badges.

522
0:30:38,440 --> 0:30:42,440
 This year's badge is NFC focused.

523
0:30:42,440 --> 0:30:46,440
 It can, it consists of two badges actually.

524
0:30:46,440 --> 0:30:55,440
 There's a reader which is the active part that has the computer and a tag which is a passive thing that can be read with the active part.

525
0:30:55,440 --> 0:30:59,440
 It's a very cool setup and it enables a lot of fun NFC hacking.

526
0:30:59,440 --> 0:31:03,440
 And we hope to see some cool things, cool applications of it.

527
0:31:03,440 --> 0:31:07,440
 As mentioned quite a few times by now, we are kind of broke.

528
0:31:07,440 --> 0:31:12,440
 And other events have charged for badges for a while.

529
0:31:12,440 --> 0:31:19,440
 And we've never done that because we, yeah, we kind of feel that we would love for this to just be a part of the ticket.

530
0:31:19,440 --> 0:31:25,440
 We haven't announced this earlier because we've been trying to secure sponsors to make it fully free.

531
0:31:25,440 --> 0:31:27,440
 That has not been possible.

532
0:31:27,440 --> 0:31:29,440
 A badge is 100 hacks.

533
0:31:29,440 --> 0:31:32,440
 If you have a full week ticket, then you have a QR code.

534
0:31:32,440 --> 0:31:35,440
 QR code in the same PDF as your ticket.

535
0:31:35,440 --> 0:31:39,440
 And you can use that to get a hacks, sorry, a badge for 100 hacks.

536
0:31:39,440 --> 0:31:46,440
 If you want additional badges or you are here on a one day ticket or you want one to take home to a friend or something, it's 150 hacks.

537
0:31:46,440 --> 0:31:52,440
 Hopefully next year we can go back to the full week tickets including a badge in the prize.

538
0:31:52,440 --> 0:31:55,440
 Sadly this was the best we could do this year.

539
0:31:55,440 --> 0:31:58,440
 The badges will be presented tomorrow.

540
0:32:02,440 --> 0:32:07,440
 Thank you.

541
0:32:07,440 --> 0:32:15,440
 The badges will be presented tomorrow at 1300 by Floma from the badge team who will talk about the design and what it can do.

542
0:32:15,440 --> 0:32:20,440
 And I'm sure there will be a lot of fun things about it.

543
0:32:20,440 --> 0:32:23,440
 They look, I wanted to include a picture but I didn't have time.

544
0:32:23,440 --> 0:32:25,440
 They look fantastically cool.

545
0:32:25,440 --> 0:32:28,440
 So I'm looking forward to seeing them all around the venue.

546
0:32:28,440 --> 0:32:29,440
 Thank you.

547
0:32:29,440 --> 0:32:30,440
 Thank you.

548
0:32:30,440 --> 0:32:31,440
 Thank you.

549
0:32:31,440 --> 0:32:35,440
 So we still have a few teams that need members.

550
0:32:35,440 --> 0:32:39,440
 The info team is continuously onboarding new people.

551
0:32:39,440 --> 0:32:42,440
 They always need people to set up there.

552
0:32:42,440 --> 0:32:46,440
 Sometimes they have to sit two or three people to manage the load.

553
0:32:46,440 --> 0:32:51,440
 And it just takes a lot of volunteers to keep the info desk open.

554
0:32:51,440 --> 0:32:56,440
 The video team manages this stuff right here.

555
0:32:56,440 --> 0:32:58,440
 Make sure stuff is recorded and streamed.

556
0:32:58,440 --> 0:33:00,440
 And we can watch the recordings later.

557
0:33:00,440 --> 0:33:03,440
 Or at least sit in the tents and watch the streams live.

558
0:33:03,440 --> 0:33:05,440
 Not everything is recorded.

559
0:33:05,440 --> 0:33:09,440
 Please make sure you note in the program if there's a little recording icon or not.

560
0:33:09,440 --> 0:33:12,440
 And if not, you have to be present here if you want to see it.

561
0:33:12,440 --> 0:33:19,440
 The stuff that's being recorded, if you're prevented from seeing it, you can catch it later on the stream.

562
0:33:19,440 --> 0:33:28,440
 If you want to join the video meeting, the video team, there's an onboarding meeting tomorrow Thursday at noon here in the speaker's tent.

563
0:33:28,440 --> 0:33:29,440
 They have a very thorough onboarding.

564
0:33:29,440 --> 0:33:33,440
 And it looks a bit intimidating, all the equipment.

565
0:33:33,440 --> 0:33:35,440
 But it is easy to do.

566
0:33:35,440 --> 0:33:38,440
 And you get a first-row seat for the talks.

567
0:33:38,440 --> 0:33:41,440
 And we would appreciate help with that.

568
0:33:41,440 --> 0:33:48,440
 The sanitation team, colloquially Team Shit, handles...

569
0:33:48,440 --> 0:33:50,440
 They do not clean toilets.

570
0:33:50,440 --> 0:33:52,440
 Might occasionally unclog one.

571
0:33:52,440 --> 0:33:54,440
 But cleaning is handled by an external cleaning company.

572
0:33:54,440 --> 0:33:58,440
 But they handle stuff like making sure there's handpaper.

573
0:33:58,440 --> 0:34:02,440
 Handpaper towels and soap and stuff in the toilets.

574
0:34:02,440 --> 0:34:07,440
 And the trash being emptied and put in the container.

575
0:34:07,440 --> 0:34:10,440
 And the deposit bags being emptied and stuff like that.

576
0:34:10,440 --> 0:34:15,440
 So it's handling all the waste but not actually cleaning toilets.

577
0:34:15,440 --> 0:34:16,440
 We have people for that.

578
0:34:16,440 --> 0:34:18,440
 They're also onboarding continuously.

579
0:34:18,440 --> 0:34:23,440
 And you can go to the info desk and speak to Anke, I guess, if you're interested in joining.

580
0:34:23,440 --> 0:34:26,440
 On the website, there's a list of teams.

581
0:34:26,440 --> 0:34:29,440
 And you can see there which ones still need members.

582
0:34:29,440 --> 0:34:37,440
 We've also, as a new initiative, started a daily volunteer meeting every day at 14.00.

583
0:34:37,440 --> 0:34:40,440
 It is in the start tent across from the info desk.

584
0:34:40,440 --> 0:34:46,440
 And it is an attempt to keep some of the awesome communication going we've had during build-up.

585
0:34:46,440 --> 0:34:49,440
 We have meetings after each meal.

586
0:34:49,440 --> 0:34:54,440
 And we have breakfast, lunch, and dinner prepared by Jonathan, which is always fantastic.

587
0:34:54,440 --> 0:34:56,440
 And after that, we have a conference.

588
0:34:56,440 --> 0:34:58,440
 And we talk about what needs to be done.

589
0:34:58,440 --> 0:35:01,440
 And people put up their hands and go do stuff.

590
0:35:01,440 --> 0:35:05,440
 And that kind of stops when the event starts because we lose contact to all the volunteers.

591
0:35:05,440 --> 0:35:07,440
 We don't have these regular meetings anymore.

592
0:35:07,440 --> 0:35:13,440
 And we want to remedy that by doing this daily volunteer meetup at 14.00.

593
0:35:13,440 --> 0:35:15,440
 Everybody, you don't have to be on a team.

594
0:35:15,440 --> 0:35:22,440
 If you don't have anything to do, if you want to help out, show up at the start tent across from info desk.

595
0:35:22,440 --> 0:35:25,440
 One of the recurring themes will be,

596
0:35:25,440 --> 0:35:30,440
 since we are a bit broke this year, we could not afford as much cleaning as we normally can.

597
0:35:30,440 --> 0:35:32,440
 So the food area will not be clean for us.

598
0:35:32,440 --> 0:35:34,440
 We have to do that ourselves.

599
0:35:34,440 --> 0:35:37,440
 And one of the things we will do every day at 2.00 is to take a bunch of volunteers,

600
0:35:37,440 --> 0:35:40,440
 go down there, do the tornado, make it look really nice.

601
0:35:40,440 --> 0:35:43,440
 And hopefully we can keep it going.

602
0:35:43,440 --> 0:35:48,440
 You are also, of course, all required to clean up after yourself when you use the food area,

603
0:35:48,440 --> 0:35:51,440
 when you cook, when you do dishes.

604
0:35:51,440 --> 0:35:53,440
 If you spill something, please fix it yourself.

605
0:35:53,440 --> 0:35:54,440
 It's not necessary.

606
0:35:54,440 --> 0:35:55,440
 It's not necessary to say.

607
0:35:55,440 --> 0:36:00,440
 But we know that when many people use the kitchen, no matter how careful everybody is,

608
0:36:00,440 --> 0:36:04,440
 there's going to be spills and stuff that needs cleaning.

609
0:36:04,440 --> 0:36:07,440
 And since there are no cleaners doing it, we have to do it ourselves.

610
0:36:07,440 --> 0:36:09,440
 If you see something, clean it up.

611
0:36:09,440 --> 0:36:10,440
 Absolutely.

612
0:36:10,440 --> 0:36:12,440
 That would be fantastic.

613
0:36:12,440 --> 0:36:17,440
 But we are planning to take a team of people once a day and give it the once over.

614
0:36:17,440 --> 0:36:20,440
 So it stays nice and inviting to use.

615
0:36:20,440 --> 0:36:24,440
 So if you feel like helping out with that and other stuff that pops up,

616
0:36:24,440 --> 0:36:28,440
 it will be every day at 14.00 in the volunteer tent.

617
0:36:28,440 --> 0:36:30,440
 We hope to see many people.

618
0:36:30,440 --> 0:36:36,440
 And we are excited to introduce this new...

619
0:36:36,440 --> 0:36:41,440
 We think it's going to be a great addition to an already great event.

620
0:36:45,440 --> 0:36:51,440
 SIRT are here to take care of us in case something happens.

621
0:36:51,440 --> 0:36:53,440
 It is our medic team.

622
0:36:54,440 --> 0:37:01,440
 We take care of small and big things like ticks or small cuts or worse.

623
0:37:01,440 --> 0:37:07,440
 We haven't had much of the worst, but we have people to handle it in case it happens.

624
0:37:07,440 --> 0:37:09,440
 We have a hard starter.

625
0:37:09,440 --> 0:37:11,440
 We have first aid kits.

626
0:37:11,440 --> 0:37:17,440
 We have educated people who have been in situations where they have to take care of people before.

627
0:37:17,440 --> 0:37:19,440
 And we are in good hands.

628
0:37:19,440 --> 0:37:21,440
 They are wearing orange vests.

629
0:37:21,440 --> 0:37:23,440
 They can be called on the radio.

630
0:37:23,440 --> 0:37:25,440
 You can call the born hack phone.

631
0:37:25,440 --> 0:37:27,440
 There will also be...

632
0:37:27,440 --> 0:37:29,440
 If you have a deck phone, then there's a...

633
0:37:29,440 --> 0:37:31,440
 You can call 112 on the deck phone.

634
0:37:31,440 --> 0:37:34,440
 And there's a lot of ways to get in touch with them.

635
0:37:34,440 --> 0:37:36,440
 And they will also be visible on the site.

636
0:37:36,440 --> 0:37:40,440
 There's always 24 hours a SIRT person on duty.

637
0:37:40,440 --> 0:37:44,440
 They need more people, if I recall correctly.

638
0:37:44,440 --> 0:37:45,440
 Yes.

639
0:37:45,440 --> 0:37:47,440
 And they have a team meeting Thursday.

640
0:37:47,440 --> 0:37:50,440
 That's tomorrow at 11 in the cabin.

641
0:37:50,440 --> 0:37:52,440
 I can't see if you're nodding.

642
0:37:52,440 --> 0:37:53,440
 Yes.

643
0:37:53,440 --> 0:37:54,440
 Yes.

644
0:37:54,440 --> 0:37:55,440
 Thank you.

645
0:37:55,440 --> 0:37:56,440
 In the cabin.

646
0:37:56,440 --> 0:37:58,440
 And they need team members.

647
0:37:58,440 --> 0:38:00,440
 And they need members, yes.

648
0:38:00,440 --> 0:38:04,440
 You don't have to be like a trained anything.

649
0:38:04,440 --> 0:38:10,440
 But it, of course, helps if you are.

650
0:38:10,440 --> 0:38:14,440
 Photo team will wear white vests.

651
0:38:14,440 --> 0:38:16,440
 It is...

652
0:38:16,440 --> 0:38:18,440
 They are recognizable for a good reason.

653
0:38:18,440 --> 0:38:21,440
 We have a code of conduct, like I mentioned.

654
0:38:21,440 --> 0:38:23,440
 And one of the important...

655
0:38:23,440 --> 0:38:29,440
 One of the parts of it, they're all important, is that you're not allowed to take pictures

656
0:38:29,440 --> 0:38:36,440
 at Bonn Heck unless everybody or all people in the photo agree to the photo being taken.

657
0:38:36,440 --> 0:38:39,440
 This means I cannot take a crowd photo here.

658
0:38:39,440 --> 0:38:41,440
 It would take forever to ask everybody.

659
0:38:41,440 --> 0:38:43,440
 Well, I have a microphone.

660
0:38:43,440 --> 0:38:46,440
 But still, generally, you can take crowd pictures.

661
0:38:46,440 --> 0:38:47,440
 It's tricky.

662
0:38:47,440 --> 0:38:48,440
 And it's sad.

663
0:38:48,440 --> 0:38:50,440
 But we have to protect people's privacy.

664
0:38:50,440 --> 0:38:56,440
 And prioritize that over people's desire to take cool pictures of crowds.

665
0:39:05,440 --> 0:39:08,440
 We do, however, want to see cool pictures.

666
0:39:08,440 --> 0:39:10,440
 And that is quite the dilemma.

667
0:39:10,440 --> 0:39:12,440
 So we have a photo team.

668
0:39:12,440 --> 0:39:13,440
 They all know...

669
0:39:13,440 --> 0:39:16,440
 Well, you all know the code of conduct because you've used the toilets.

670
0:39:16,440 --> 0:39:19,440
 But they know...

671
0:39:19,440 --> 0:39:26,440
 A lot of people here personally know who they can take pictures of and who has already said no.

672
0:39:26,440 --> 0:39:30,440
 And if they see new people, they might come and ask, is it okay I take a picture here?

673
0:39:30,440 --> 0:39:33,440
 You are free to say no and stay where you are.

674
0:39:33,440 --> 0:39:35,440
 You are free to say no and step out.

675
0:39:35,440 --> 0:39:39,440
 And the photographer can take the picture, make it work somehow.

676
0:39:39,440 --> 0:39:46,440
 But they are visible in white vests and, of course, a piece of huge optics around their neck.

677
0:39:46,440 --> 0:39:47,440
 And...

678
0:39:47,440 --> 0:39:49,440
 And they will ask permissions for pictures.

679
0:39:49,440 --> 0:39:56,440
 And if you feel like a picture has been taken where you weren't asked or maybe you were in it or you are not sure,

680
0:39:56,440 --> 0:40:00,440
 you are very welcome to go ask the photographer to see the pictures and browse through.

681
0:40:00,440 --> 0:40:03,440
 And if you feel like you are on one of them or you are...

682
0:40:03,440 --> 0:40:05,440
 Then it can be deleted.

683
0:40:05,440 --> 0:40:06,440
 But it shouldn't happen.

684
0:40:06,440 --> 0:40:08,440
 They are careful and they know what they are doing.

685
0:40:08,440 --> 0:40:09,440
 I'm not sure.

686
0:40:09,440 --> 0:40:11,440
 Does the photo team need more people?

687
0:40:14,440 --> 0:40:16,440
 Yes, everybody is welcome.

688
0:40:17,440 --> 0:40:23,440
 Okay, so if you like taking pictures and this sounds like something you could and would do,

689
0:40:23,440 --> 0:40:30,440
 then talk to Tobias Fonsmark and he can introduce you to the whole thing.

690
0:40:30,440 --> 0:40:33,440
 There is a meeting tomorrow at noon.

691
0:40:33,440 --> 0:40:35,440
 Is it also in the cabin?

692
0:40:35,440 --> 0:40:37,440
 Yes, exactly.

693
0:40:37,440 --> 0:40:38,440
 Also in the cabin.

694
0:40:38,440 --> 0:40:39,440
 Great.

695
0:40:41,440 --> 0:40:44,440
 The game team has prepared a token game again this year.

696
0:40:44,440 --> 0:40:46,440
 The tokens are little text strings.

697
0:40:46,440 --> 0:40:54,440
 They are hidden around the venue offline and online on physical signs or it could be on servers or networks.

698
0:40:54,440 --> 0:40:56,440
 There are all kinds of things.

699
0:40:56,440 --> 0:40:59,440
 There are hints in your profile on the website.

700
0:40:59,440 --> 0:41:06,440
 And I think they will keep adding tokens throughout the week.

701
0:41:06,440 --> 0:41:08,440
 And the hunt is usually great.

702
0:41:08,440 --> 0:41:15,440
 The hunt is usually competitive and fun and it's kind of like a treasure hunt for nerds all around the venue.

703
0:41:15,440 --> 0:41:18,440
 It is a great tradition and I hope many of you will play.

704
0:41:18,440 --> 0:41:21,440
 I know the game team has put a lot of work into it.

705
0:41:26,440 --> 0:41:30,440
 The last slide is just a thank you to the volunteers.

706
0:41:30,440 --> 0:41:35,440
 This event would not be possible without the volunteers.

707
0:41:35,440 --> 0:41:36,440
 That goes without saying.

708
0:41:36,440 --> 0:41:44,440
 We are, what, 11 people in the Orga group and it would absolutely not be possible to do all this without them.

709
0:41:44,440 --> 0:41:53,440
 Without 30 or 40 people helping out with carrying stuff around and helping us with our crazy ideas.

710
0:41:53,440 --> 0:41:55,440
 And, hey, we want to build a weird thing here.

711
0:41:55,440 --> 0:41:56,440
 Can you?

712
0:41:56,440 --> 0:41:57,440
 And people just run over and start building.

713
0:41:57,440 --> 0:42:02,440
 It's just fantastic to be around people with this kind of drive and this kind of passion.

714
0:42:02,440 --> 0:42:09,440
 And it's so nice that you throw that drive and that passion towards helping us make this event even more fantastic.

715
0:42:09,440 --> 0:42:11,440
 So, again, thank you all.

716
0:42:14,440 --> 0:42:17,440
 And a big thanks to the rest of our colleagues as well.

717
0:42:17,440 --> 0:42:18,440
 Thank you.

718
0:42:18,440 --> 0:42:23,440
 Thank you.

719
0:42:23,440 --> 0:42:27,440
 Please consider showing up for the meetings at the 1400.

720
0:42:27,440 --> 0:42:35,440
 We've been a bit jiggy and added it to the schedule, so it will show up in your giggity and in your feedreaders and calendars and stuff.

721
0:42:35,440 --> 0:42:41,440
 So give it a try, show up if you have nothing else to do.

722
0:42:41,440 --> 0:42:43,440
 I added this slide in case I thought of something to say.

723
0:42:43,440 --> 0:42:44,440
 I wanted to say one thing.

724
0:42:44,440 --> 0:42:48,040
 talking, but I haven't.

725
0:42:48,040 --> 0:42:54,960
 So I don't think I have anything else, but if any team leads may have comments or stuff

726
0:42:54,960 --> 0:43:02,100
 I forgot to include that would be relevant to include now, then we can do that.

727
0:43:02,100 --> 0:43:21,660
 We are getting a microphone, just a second.

728
0:43:21,660 --> 0:43:22,660
 Is there a regular Bonhag network?

729
0:43:22,660 --> 0:43:23,660
 Is there?

730
0:43:23,660 --> 0:43:24,660
 Yes.

731
0:43:24,660 --> 0:43:25,660
 Oh, I didn't see.

732
0:43:25,660 --> 0:43:26,660
 Oh, sorry.

733
0:43:26,660 --> 0:43:29,740
 There's four SSIDs and one of them is just called Bonhag and it's a plain old public

734
0:43:29,740 --> 0:43:30,740
 V4 and V6.

735
0:43:30,740 --> 0:43:32,080
 You get a real IP address.

736
0:43:32,080 --> 0:43:37,460
 Make sure your firewall is properly configured because that's like going on the old school

737
0:43:37,460 --> 0:43:40,460
 internet back in the 90s.

738
0:43:40,460 --> 0:43:51,040
 It's supposed to be.

739
0:43:51,040 --> 0:43:52,040
 It's not.

740
0:43:52,040 --> 0:43:53,040
 It's supposed to be.

741
0:43:53,040 --> 0:43:54,040
 It's not.

742
0:43:54,040 --> 0:43:55,040
 It's supposed to be.

743
0:43:55,040 --> 0:43:56,040
 It's not.

744
0:43:56,040 --> 0:43:57,040
 It's supposed to be.

745
0:43:57,040 --> 0:43:58,040
 It's not.

746
0:43:58,040 --> 0:43:59,040
 It's not.

747
0:43:59,040 --> 0:44:00,040
 It's not.

748
0:44:00,040 --> 0:44:01,040
 It's not.

749
0:44:01,040 --> 0:44:02,040
 It's not.

750
0:44:02,040 --> 0:44:03,040
 It's not.

751
0:44:03,040 --> 0:44:04,040
 It's not.

752
0:44:04,040 --> 0:44:05,040
 It's not.

753
0:44:05,040 --> 0:44:06,040
 It's not.

754
0:44:06,040 --> 0:44:07,040
 It's not.

755
0:44:07,040 --> 0:44:08,040
 It's not.

756
0:44:08,040 --> 0:44:09,040
 Oh, damn.

757
0:44:09,040 --> 0:44:10,040
 Okay.

758
0:44:10,040 --> 0:44:13,900
 I'll repeat because the audio was a bit low.

759
0:44:13,900 --> 0:44:20,580
 If you ordered village gear and you ordered the black upholstered chairs, sorry, you ordered

760
0:44:20,580 --> 0:44:24,940
 the white garden chairs and accidentally instead took the black upholstered chairs, please

761
0:44:24,940 --> 0:44:26,980
 bring them back because we need them.

762
0:44:26,980 --> 0:44:29,420
 The people who actually ordered them need them.

763
0:44:29,420 --> 0:44:30,940
 And come back and get some V4s.

764
0:44:30,940 --> 0:44:31,940
 Thanks.

765
0:44:31,940 --> 0:44:33,000
 white garden chairs instead.

766
0:44:33,740 --> 0:44:35,800
 Basically, the garden chairs, the white ones, are

767
0:44:35,800 --> 0:44:37,880
 good for the grass, and the other ones are good for when

768
0:44:37,880 --> 0:44:40,080
 you have a floor in your

769
0:44:40,080 --> 0:44:41,800
 tent. It's

770
0:44:41,800 --> 0:44:43,740
 kind of late to change now, because we can't

771
0:44:43,740 --> 0:44:45,200
 change the order, but

772
0:44:45,200 --> 0:44:47,820
 if you did get the

773
0:44:47,820 --> 0:44:49,960
 upholstered chairs, and you have those on your receipt,

774
0:44:50,080 --> 0:44:51,880
 and you know, you know what

775
0:44:51,880 --> 0:44:53,880
 I'm saying. If you took the wrong chairs,

776
0:44:53,980 --> 0:44:55,460
 please bring them back. Thank you.

777
0:44:57,440 --> 0:44:57,840
 Any

778
0:44:57,840 --> 0:44:58,880
 other questions?

779
0:45:00,140 --> 0:45:01,480
 Just ask without the microphone.

780
0:45:02,480 --> 0:45:03,780
 How do you submit a category

781
0:45:03,780 --> 0:45:05,760
 to Hacker Jeopardy? Oh, that's a very

782
0:45:05,760 --> 0:45:06,320
 good question.

783
0:45:07,840 --> 0:45:09,960
 The Hacker Jeopardy will be on tomorrow,

784
0:45:10,260 --> 0:45:11,800
 and then again Saturday,

785
0:45:12,060 --> 0:45:13,880
 and again Monday for the finals.

786
0:45:14,780 --> 0:45:15,920
 Sign-ups is

787
0:45:15,920 --> 0:45:17,920
 to info at bornhack.dk

788
0:45:17,920 --> 0:45:19,720
 by mail. We already got the first sign-up

789
0:45:19,720 --> 0:45:20,920
 a few days before the event,

790
0:45:21,600 --> 0:45:22,440
 and

791
0:45:22,440 --> 0:45:25,860
 we always, the game team, always

792
0:45:25,860 --> 0:45:27,380
 needs more categories.

793
0:45:27,840 --> 0:45:29,600
 If you've played Hacker Jeopardy before,

794
0:45:29,800 --> 0:45:31,620
 or been a

795
0:45:31,620 --> 0:45:31,920
 spectator,

796
0:45:31,940 --> 0:45:33,820
 you know what this is about.

797
0:45:34,040 --> 0:45:34,300
 It is

798
0:45:34,300 --> 0:45:37,820
 find a fun category, find some questions that are

799
0:45:37,820 --> 0:45:38,520
 not too difficult.

800
0:45:38,800 --> 0:45:41,440
 The one trap people always fall in

801
0:45:41,440 --> 0:45:43,880
 is like, okay, I'm an expert on this,

802
0:45:43,940 --> 0:45:45,840
 I'll make a category so difficult that I'm

803
0:45:45,840 --> 0:45:47,840
 the only person in the room who can answer it.

804
0:45:48,180 --> 0:45:49,400
 And that's just

805
0:45:49,400 --> 0:45:51,960
 not a lot of fun to other people than the person

806
0:45:51,960 --> 0:45:52,940
 who knows all the answers.

807
0:45:54,000 --> 0:45:55,740
 What we want is categories

808
0:45:55,740 --> 0:45:58,020
 that go from the most difficult one,

809
0:45:58,760 --> 0:45:59,440
 maybe

810
0:45:59,440 --> 0:46:01,560
 maybe 25% knows it,

811
0:46:01,560 --> 0:46:03,780
 and the easiest one, almost everybody knows it,

812
0:46:03,780 --> 0:46:05,380
 and it's a chase for the buttons.

813
0:46:05,620 --> 0:46:07,980
 It has to be, it's much more fun that way.

814
0:46:07,980 --> 0:46:10,040
 Trust us, we've tried both ways,

815
0:46:10,040 --> 0:46:11,740
 and take our words for it.

816
0:46:12,940 --> 0:46:14,900
 So please send categories to,

817
0:46:14,900 --> 0:46:22,500
 is there a game-team at bornhack.dk

818
0:46:22,860 --> 0:46:25,100
 and send your categories, or send questions.

819
0:46:25,100 --> 0:46:26,900
 If you don't know quite how to formulate it,

820
0:46:26,900 --> 0:46:28,700
 they will be happy to get you started.

821
0:46:29,280 --> 0:46:31,460
 If you're playing and you submitted a category,

822
0:46:31,460 --> 0:46:33,220
 please let us know the day you're on,

823
0:46:33,280 --> 0:46:35,760
 so we don't accidentally schedule your own questions

824
0:46:35,760 --> 0:46:36,460
 when you're playing.

825
0:46:41,460 --> 0:46:42,540
 Yeah, yes?

826
0:46:43,300 --> 0:46:47,060
 I missed POC in this point.

827
0:46:47,200 --> 0:46:49,240
 It would be fun to say that DECT is working now.

828
0:46:51,020 --> 0:46:53,180
 For the first time in a few years,

829
0:46:53,280 --> 0:46:54,780
 we have a working DECT network.

830
0:46:55,100 --> 0:46:57,260
 Thank you to the POC team for getting that up and running.

831
0:47:01,460 --> 0:47:02,200
 Thank you.

832
0:47:02,200 --> 0:47:03,200
 Thank you.

833
0:47:05,680 --> 0:47:08,980
 This means you can go to the website,

834
0:47:08,980 --> 0:47:11,180
 register a phone number in the phone book there

835
0:47:11,180 --> 0:47:14,160
 with your account, and then you get an activation code,

836
0:47:14,160 --> 0:47:16,800
 you dial that on your DECT phone, and you are rolling.

837
0:47:16,800 --> 0:47:19,300
 It's easy, and it's fucking awesome,

838
0:47:19,300 --> 0:47:22,500
 and I'm looking forward to getting my own phones hooked up

839
0:47:22,500 --> 0:47:25,920
 as soon as I don't have a million other things to do.

840
0:47:26,780 --> 0:47:29,580
 So, oh, any more questions?

841
0:47:30,280 --> 0:47:31,300
 I can't really see.

842
0:47:31,460 --> 0:47:50,460
 You forgot to give a hand to the Orca team.

843
0:47:50,460 --> 0:47:51,460
 Thank you.

844
0:48:01,460 --> 0:48:06,700
 We love you, too.

845
0:48:06,700 --> 0:48:11,620
 We forgot to say, you can spot the organisers from these very snazzy latest fashion black

846
0:48:11,620 --> 0:48:13,980
 vests that we're wearing this year.

847
0:48:13,980 --> 0:48:18,660
 So black vests for Orca, white vests for photo team, orange for SIRT, and the yellow vest

848
0:48:18,660 --> 0:48:22,660
 is other volunteers.

849
0:48:22,660 --> 0:48:27,700
 So that's the colour scheme for this year, or hopefully going forward.

850
0:48:27,700 --> 0:48:30,080
 OK, fantastic.

851
0:48:30,080 --> 0:48:31,080
 We got through it.

852
0:48:31,080 --> 0:48:32,080
 Under an hour.

853
0:48:32,080 --> 0:48:37,840
 That's the new record, and I almost didn't cry, and we're pretty good.

854
0:48:37,840 --> 0:48:38,840
 So...

855
0:48:38,840 --> 0:48:40,840
 See you at the bar!

856
0:48:40,840 --> 0:48:41,840
 Yes, exactly.

857
0:48:41,840 --> 0:48:42,840
 We'll see you all at the bar.

858
0:48:42,840 --> 0:48:43,840
 Thank you for everything.
