# Transcribed 2023-11-10 with medium model size

1
0:00:00,000 --> 0:00:11,920
 The next speakers we have is the game team that will give us the state of the game.

2
0:00:11,920 --> 0:00:18,280
 Let's give them a hand.

3
0:00:18,280 --> 0:00:19,280
 Thank you.

4
0:00:19,280 --> 0:00:22,520
 We were supposed to be three people presenting today.

5
0:00:22,520 --> 0:00:27,440
 One is currently treating a wound, so I will be the first one.

6
0:00:27,440 --> 0:00:34,720
 And then we will have Asperon announcing the winner of the game game in the last half.

7
0:00:34,720 --> 0:00:40,640
 So yes, the token game has now ended.

8
0:00:40,640 --> 0:00:47,360
 You can still attempt to find some tokens if you want, but you can't win anymore.

9
0:00:47,360 --> 0:00:54,240
 So we had a lot of different activities.

10
0:00:54,240 --> 0:01:06,160
 So the two official ones we have are the Hacker Jeopardy and the token hunter.

11
0:01:06,160 --> 0:01:13,960
 But we also have a lot of game-related things created by participants.

12
0:01:13,960 --> 0:01:20,320
 So we have some board games, we have a game jam, which is announced in a bit, a Pendleton,

13
0:01:20,320 --> 0:01:24,360
 garden games, a Mario Kart tournament.

14
0:01:24,360 --> 0:01:26,720
 It sounded like they really had fun in that Mario Kart tournament.

15
0:01:26,720 --> 0:01:29,960
 I could hear it all the time.

16
0:01:29,960 --> 0:01:33,480
 We have a music quiz, treasure hunt, and a COAD tournament.

17
0:01:33,480 --> 0:01:37,960
 So it's very nice to see people enjoying themselves.

18
0:01:37,960 --> 0:01:41,440
 And we also have the pixel plot, of course.

19
0:01:41,440 --> 0:01:47,200
 So the Hacker Jeopardy.

20
0:01:47,200 --> 0:01:52,660
 We had a lot of positive feedback.

21
0:01:52,660 --> 0:01:57,520
 So we had this year done a bit of prep work.

22
0:01:57,520 --> 0:02:02,720
 I'm not personally the one who does the Hacker Jeopardy, but the team who did it did some

23
0:02:02,720 --> 0:02:05,320
 really nice work.

24
0:02:06,040 --> 0:02:14,040
 It seemed to have paid off, the preparation, and they were really going a few months in

25
0:02:14,040 --> 0:02:15,040
 a while.

26
0:02:15,040 --> 0:02:18,200
 So it was really nice to see all the emails we got.

27
0:02:18,200 --> 0:02:29,120
 Yes, and we got nine categories during the camp, which were not ourselves.

28
0:02:29,120 --> 0:02:38,240
 So one round-up for it is that we need more Hacker Network and cybersecurity-related topics.

29
0:02:38,240 --> 0:02:45,680
 We could see that, well, some participants could need a bit of more network knowledge,

30
0:02:45,680 --> 0:02:49,940
 but it would also be nice to have some cybersecurity things.

31
0:02:49,940 --> 0:02:58,960
 We have previously been focused a lot on software-related stuff, but this is a growing field and we

32
0:02:58,960 --> 0:03:02,760
 have a lot of participants working in these fields and an interest in them.

33
0:03:02,760 --> 0:03:08,440
 So if you have some ideas, you can write it to the email listed here.

34
0:03:08,440 --> 0:03:12,380
 We were very much like so.

35
0:03:12,380 --> 0:03:15,520
 You can just write it in this moment or wait a few months.

36
0:03:15,520 --> 0:03:23,600
 But we were very much like the categories because they are really hard to make up.

37
0:03:23,600 --> 0:03:29,280
 Well, then we have the token game.

38
0:03:29,280 --> 0:03:33,520
 So in 2023, we had 60 participants.

39
0:03:33,520 --> 0:03:34,520
 This is really nice.

40
0:03:34,520 --> 0:03:43,000
 It's actually a few more than in 2021 and 2022.

41
0:03:43,000 --> 0:03:46,320
 We had 27 unique tokens.

42
0:03:46,320 --> 0:03:51,520
 Well, it's 10 more than the last time.

43
0:03:51,520 --> 0:03:59,760
 We did a little more preparation, so I think it's a nice amount.

44
0:03:59,760 --> 0:04:07,520
 I would personally like to prepare some more tokens ahead of Bornhack, but it is really

45
0:04:07,520 --> 0:04:09,920
 hard to come up with tokens also.

46
0:04:09,920 --> 0:04:14,840
 So if participants want to make some, you're most definitely welcome and write us an email

47
0:04:14,840 --> 0:04:18,280
 if you want.

48
0:04:18,280 --> 0:04:24,360
 So the average tokens found per participant were four.

49
0:04:24,360 --> 0:04:26,400
 It's less than 2021.

50
0:04:26,400 --> 0:04:29,640
 You were really playing that year.

51
0:04:29,640 --> 0:04:36,560
 But it is really nice that people who started playing kept playing a bit more than last

52
0:04:36,560 --> 0:04:37,560
 year.

53
0:04:37,560 --> 0:04:39,200
 That's really nice to see.

54
0:04:39,200 --> 0:04:45,360
 We have eight participants who found more than 10 tokens.

55
0:04:45,360 --> 0:04:51,200
 We don't really categorize them, but I would say that's like the players who keep playing

56
0:04:51,200 --> 0:04:55,440
 and attempting to find as many as they can.

57
0:04:55,440 --> 0:05:02,080
 And then we have two participants who found all 27 tokens.

58
0:05:02,080 --> 0:05:11,360
 So you can battle it out with whoever gets the prize, but you have to figure that out.

59
0:05:11,360 --> 0:05:17,520
 So what lessons did we learn this time?

60
0:05:17,520 --> 0:05:22,880
 We didn't have enough tokens that did not need a computer.

61
0:05:22,880 --> 0:05:31,200
 So a lot of the tokens require you to have some computing knowledge and also a computer

62
0:05:31,200 --> 0:05:33,320
 in your hand.

63
0:05:33,320 --> 0:05:41,480
 It would be nice to have some more tokens that are based on puzzles and color recognition

64
0:05:41,480 --> 0:05:44,720
 and similar things.

65
0:05:44,720 --> 0:05:52,480
 It has been heavily dependent on the token as a string, as a text string.

66
0:05:52,480 --> 0:05:58,660
 So naturally that's the way we went, that somehow you could get a token out of a piece

67
0:05:58,660 --> 0:06:02,040
 of string somewhere.

68
0:06:02,040 --> 0:06:07,840
 But it would be very nice to have some things where you could use pattern recognition also.

69
0:06:07,840 --> 0:06:20,960
 Yes, I have already said it, but we would benefit if we prepare more.

70
0:06:20,960 --> 0:06:25,520
 We are very low maintenance when we're in off events.

71
0:06:25,520 --> 0:06:30,680
 Most of the content happens actually at the event.

72
0:06:30,680 --> 0:06:37,040
 Not even during buildup, it's just when the event starts, this is when token hunt creation

73
0:06:37,040 --> 0:06:38,040
 starts.

74
0:06:38,040 --> 0:06:42,600
 We did some small things and it really helped out.

75
0:06:42,600 --> 0:06:47,360
 We had the space invader, for example, which already included the token before it was set

76
0:06:47,360 --> 0:06:50,260
 up.

77
0:06:50,260 --> 0:06:54,920
 So yeah, we have received a lot of nice input.

78
0:06:54,920 --> 0:07:03,560
 And yeah, we would like to also make tokens more accessible for players.

79
0:07:03,560 --> 0:07:08,300
 So this is a thing that we need to work on, is again the thing with the computers.

80
0:07:08,300 --> 0:07:21,160
 Not everybody is that good with computers necessarily, or may not be studying a computer

81
0:07:22,160 --> 0:07:29,640
 on a university and doing math all the time.

82
0:07:29,640 --> 0:07:36,760
 Again it's like we keep enjoying this, but magic just happens when other teams and other

83
0:07:36,760 --> 0:07:41,560
 participants just say, hey, I would like to make this token, can I make this token?

84
0:07:41,560 --> 0:07:46,580
 And then we say, yes, most definitely.

85
0:07:46,580 --> 0:07:54,460
 So it's really nice when the batch team or this year the phone operation center really

86
0:07:54,460 --> 0:07:59,460
 just said, yeah, I would like to make this thing, can I make this thing?

87
0:07:59,460 --> 0:08:01,180
 That came some really nice things out of it.

88
0:08:01,180 --> 0:08:05,380
 So I can show some more details on it.

89
0:08:05,380 --> 0:08:11,440
 We have the batch token.

90
0:08:11,440 --> 0:08:12,900
 So I'm not the one who created this.

91
0:08:12,900 --> 0:08:17,060
 I'm a bit unsure about the details on them, but let's get to it.

92
0:08:17,060 --> 0:08:20,900
 So on the batch, there is some letters you can read.

93
0:08:20,900 --> 0:08:25,020
 Well, this whole grid refers to a token.

94
0:08:25,020 --> 0:08:40,780
 So it is basically encoded, and you can, if you decode it, you can get Frank Miller, 18,

95
0:08:40,780 --> 0:08:41,860
 and the year.

96
0:08:41,860 --> 0:08:51,060
 So you can, let's see how many we have here, yes, a lot of things.

97
0:08:51,060 --> 0:09:03,700
 So that's a lot of references to this one-time pad of the paper from Frank Miller, and I

98
0:09:03,700 --> 0:09:08,020
 guess you had to go in and read it.

99
0:09:08,020 --> 0:09:13,420
 Or similar, to start finding the tokens, but yes, that was most definitely tokens on the

100
0:09:13,420 --> 0:09:15,180
 batch again this year.

101
0:09:15,180 --> 0:09:17,460
 Maybe we will have it again.

102
0:09:17,460 --> 0:09:23,100
 So the batch had NFC, right?

103
0:09:23,100 --> 0:09:29,860
 Yeah, I didn't make these slides, unfortunately, so I'm not sure what all these numbers mean,

104
0:09:29,860 --> 0:09:39,740
 but someone says hack the planet, and you could convert it to the token in the end.

105
0:09:39,740 --> 0:09:43,900
 I'm sorry, I don't know what the end result gives.

106
0:09:43,900 --> 0:09:52,260
 Maybe a participant could explain.

107
0:09:52,260 --> 0:10:01,860
 And then we have this one, it's also a bit of evil, that this batch gives you access

108
0:10:01,860 --> 0:10:07,820
 to the data needed to gain SSX access to a VM that contains some data that contains more

109
0:10:07,820 --> 0:10:10,820
 tokens.

110
0:10:10,820 --> 0:10:20,580
 Yeah, again, I have no idea what this means.

111
0:10:20,580 --> 0:10:33,580
 Yes, unfortunately, who knows what all these numbers mean, and yeah, you can find him after

112
0:10:33,580 --> 0:10:41,100
 this talk if you want, and get some explanations, but I'm sorry, I cannot.

113
0:10:41,100 --> 0:10:45,140
 So we also had some Dex phone numbers we could call.

114
0:10:45,140 --> 0:10:53,420
 You can call the number that corresponds to token game, and it will read out some nice

115
0:10:53,420 --> 0:10:58,620
 letters to you in phonetic alphabet.

116
0:10:58,620 --> 0:11:02,380
 You probably have to record it or call it at least three times or four times to get

117
0:11:02,380 --> 0:11:04,980
 it on the whole thing, but that's a token there.

118
0:11:04,980 --> 0:11:14,300
 You can also call the number token, and well, you will get a conversation from the movie

119
0:11:15,060 --> 0:11:23,540
 Hackers, where I crash overwrite the main character, request a number from a person,

120
0:11:23,540 --> 0:11:36,020
 and if you call that number, then you activate an omelette where you can then read the numbers.

121
0:11:36,020 --> 0:11:42,420
 So yeah, that's also GetLisa's numbers, and that's also one of the numbers mentioned in

122
0:11:42,420 --> 0:11:47,620
 the movie, one of the phone numbers, so you can get a little hint.

123
0:11:47,620 --> 0:11:53,020
 Thank you to Phone Operations Center, because that little piece of evil was actually very

124
0:11:53,020 --> 0:11:54,020
 nice.

125
0:11:54,020 --> 0:11:58,540
 I really loved calling in and testing different things.

126
0:11:58,540 --> 0:12:07,940
 Oh, yes, of course, that's conversion.

127
0:12:08,020 --> 0:12:17,540
 I guess that says token, and that says Lisa, and that says token hunt, or similar.

128
0:12:17,540 --> 0:12:23,700
 Apparently, that was an audio, sorry about that.

129
0:12:23,700 --> 0:12:33,820
 So we also, well, I also made some artwork together with the bat, and this, but it didn't

130
0:12:33,820 --> 0:12:40,380
 start as a token, but we made some artwork, and I thought, yeah, why not include a token?

131
0:12:40,380 --> 0:12:41,620
 This would be fun.

132
0:12:41,620 --> 0:12:51,300
 So that's a small thing that says Space Invader 1978, and if you mix those letters around,

133
0:12:51,300 --> 0:12:52,300
 you will get a token.

134
0:12:52,300 --> 0:12:57,140
 Very easy, but you should have to spot it.

135
0:12:57,140 --> 0:13:02,180
 Also credits to the nice person who took this picture, because I'm not that good at taking

136
0:13:02,180 --> 0:13:06,340
 images.

137
0:13:06,340 --> 0:13:11,460
 We also have a token in the sticker exchange.

138
0:13:11,460 --> 0:13:13,740
 Maybe you can see the QR code.

139
0:13:13,740 --> 0:13:21,900
 So there were two boxes of stickers in sticker exchange at the info desk, and you can scan

140
0:13:21,900 --> 0:13:24,300
 both of them.

141
0:13:24,340 --> 0:13:36,580
 The hint is ROT in the sticker chain, so that was the hint, and the QR code, one of the

142
0:13:36,580 --> 0:13:43,100
 QR codes had some letters, and then it said plus four or minus four, and the other one

143
0:13:43,100 --> 0:13:44,580
 did the same.

144
0:13:44,580 --> 0:13:52,180
 So you could do a rotation plus four, rotation minus four, and put them together.

145
0:13:52,220 --> 0:14:00,660
 I accidentally made one of them a little too long, so it had 33 characters, but yeah, small

146
0:14:00,660 --> 0:14:08,980
 correction much that you just removed the last letter of the token, but yeah.

147
0:14:08,980 --> 0:14:13,300
 So this was the token hunt.

148
0:14:13,300 --> 0:14:16,180
 Do we have any questions about some tokens?

149
0:14:16,180 --> 0:14:17,460
 Maybe I can answer some.

150
0:14:17,460 --> 0:14:18,460
 Yes.

151
0:14:22,660 --> 0:14:27,700
 This was definitely not all tokens, it was just a few selects.

152
0:14:27,700 --> 0:14:34,100
 So I saw that one of the tokens is the sequence of lights down the main path, is that right?

153
0:14:34,100 --> 0:14:37,100
 Yeah, I think so, yes.

154
0:14:37,100 --> 0:14:43,380
 I couldn't figure out any combination of lights that would make up 30 and make sense.

155
0:14:43,380 --> 0:14:47,340
 Also one of them is white.

156
0:14:47,340 --> 0:14:51,900
 Maybe the participant over here can answer the question.

157
0:14:51,900 --> 0:14:55,100
 So I guess the question is how are you supposed to do that one?

158
0:15:07,500 --> 0:15:17,660
 So the white one is actually blue, and you can see the film if you look, and there's

159
0:15:17,660 --> 0:15:21,100
 two towards the cabin, those count.

160
0:15:21,100 --> 0:15:26,380
 The first one here towards the bar doesn't count, and the two towards the food area doesn't

161
0:15:26,380 --> 0:15:27,660
 count either.

162
0:15:41,660 --> 0:15:44,580
 How can people sign up or help out with the game team?

163
0:15:44,580 --> 0:15:46,460
 You didn't really specify?

164
0:15:47,420 --> 0:15:52,620
 Well, you can sign up on the Bornhack website for the game team, and then drop us an email

165
0:15:52,620 --> 0:15:58,060
 and say, hey, I would very much like to be part of the token hunt.

166
0:15:58,060 --> 0:16:04,580
 Right now it's me and Dennis who are making the token hunt, but having an extra person

167
0:16:04,580 --> 0:16:14,100
 or two extra people being the, what is the English word for this, but being the caretakers

168
0:16:14,100 --> 0:16:18,260
 of the tokens would be very nice.

169
0:16:18,260 --> 0:16:24,940
 It would allow us to have more minds on it.

170
0:16:24,940 --> 0:16:28,900
 So yes, go to the Bornhack website, really, and sign up.

171
0:16:28,900 --> 0:16:50,140
 If I can ask, there was a hex in the slides between the presentations, it looked like

172
0:16:50,140 --> 0:16:53,780
 it was a valid token, but was it?

173
0:16:53,780 --> 0:16:54,780
 Which one, sorry?

174
0:16:54,860 --> 0:17:02,020
 There was a hex value in the slides between the presentations, so it was valid.

175
0:17:02,020 --> 0:17:06,940
 That was a hex encoded token in the info beamer, yes.

176
0:17:06,940 --> 0:17:13,180
 I couldn't figure out how to, I mean, I decoded it, but I couldn't get to a valid token.

177
0:17:13,180 --> 0:17:17,220
 So there's a very nice website called CyberChef, if you search on that.

178
0:17:17,220 --> 0:17:18,220
 I used it.

179
0:17:18,220 --> 0:17:25,260
 Okay, if you type it in correctly, hopefully you should get the token.

180
0:17:25,260 --> 0:17:32,100
 There was not that much else in that token than finding it and typing it and then converting

181
0:17:32,100 --> 0:17:33,100
 it over.

182
0:17:33,100 --> 0:17:39,700
 Yeah, I've done that, but maybe you can show me later.

183
0:17:39,700 --> 0:17:48,220
 And I also make mistakes sometimes, so it could be I also made some mistakes, but try

184
0:17:48,220 --> 0:17:53,940
 again and then ask me if it didn't work.

185
0:17:53,940 --> 0:17:56,940
 And then I will hop further to the next thing.

186
0:17:56,940 --> 0:17:59,940
 Well, we have the winner.

187
0:17:59,940 --> 0:18:07,660
 Oh, sorry, beyond the end of the talk.

188
0:18:07,660 --> 0:18:08,660
 Sorry about that.

189
0:18:08,660 --> 0:18:14,340
 I made mistakes there in the last second since I didn't look at the, yeah, sorry.

190
0:18:14,340 --> 0:18:16,260
 We have the pixel flute.

191
0:18:16,260 --> 0:18:26,720
 Well, this is a graph that's also showed up in the state of the network talk.

192
0:18:26,720 --> 0:18:31,940
 This is a monstrosity made by Asperger.

193
0:18:31,940 --> 0:18:37,660
 So it has an 80 gigabits, which I can explain a bit more about it.

194
0:18:37,660 --> 0:18:42,580
 But we had some participants pulling their own fibers.

195
0:18:42,580 --> 0:18:51,780
 We had Asperger himself making a pixel accelerator, takes a 10 megabit nick, like an old Bornhack

196
0:18:51,780 --> 0:19:02,860
 badge, and then do loop magic and apparently turns it up to 10 gigabits.

197
0:19:02,860 --> 0:19:14,140
 I don't know, like something with 15 kilometers of fiber.

198
0:19:14,140 --> 0:19:19,100
 It took a few days to get this up and running, but it seems like people were enjoying themselves.

199
0:19:19,100 --> 0:19:27,500
 So I hope this can keep showing up and more people would like to participate.

200
0:19:27,500 --> 0:19:29,940
 We have a little graph here.

201
0:19:30,740 --> 0:19:37,660
 Well, you can see it started, okay, the graph at least started Sunday.

202
0:19:37,660 --> 0:19:48,820
 I can hop over to this and say, well, the peak at the 95 percentile was at 31 gigabits

203
0:19:48,820 --> 0:19:50,340
 per second.

204
0:19:50,340 --> 0:19:56,380
 The switch is limited to 80 gigabits, so we'll get to near that, well, I guess we will get

205
0:19:56,380 --> 0:19:58,420
 a larger switch or something.

206
0:19:59,380 --> 0:20:06,780
 We averaged it, I cannot say that word, our average was 21 gigabits per second, and the

207
0:20:06,780 --> 0:20:13,620
 peak is like a weird thing to count, but at 43.

208
0:20:13,620 --> 0:20:20,500
 We have some new protocols, I misspelled that apparently, new protocols implemented.

209
0:20:20,500 --> 0:20:28,060
 You can find it on the link, it's the same link that hopefully all players saw.

210
0:20:28,100 --> 0:20:37,500
 And this year we had multiple 10 gigabit clients, yes, the pixel accelerator thing was great.

211
0:20:37,500 --> 0:20:45,140
 We streamed some movies on it, well, not me, but Max streamed some movies on it.

212
0:20:45,140 --> 0:20:54,460
 Labyrinth of a village pulls their own fiber and put in some QSFP plus optics.

213
0:20:54,460 --> 0:21:03,220
 They were, however, limited to 10 gigabits per machine, so it's not like bringing the

214
0:21:03,220 --> 0:21:10,460
 largest machine you can and the largest Nick, because I could just find a 100 gigabit Nick

215
0:21:10,460 --> 0:21:13,100
 and put it in if the switch couldn't take it.

216
0:21:13,100 --> 0:21:21,700
 So all clients are limited to 10 gigabits, and we were as well, but we just could sit

217
0:21:21,700 --> 0:21:29,460
 in our comfy tents instead of going all the way out next door to a machine.

218
0:21:29,460 --> 0:21:36,100
 Legacy IP addresses were again punished this year, you had to use IPv6 or else you would

219
0:21:36,100 --> 0:21:40,940
 get some transparency on your pixels.

220
0:21:40,940 --> 0:21:47,620
 You can see the little pony, perhaps, that was because I didn't update my client and

221
0:21:47,620 --> 0:21:51,020
 could not find the V6 version I made somewhere.

222
0:21:51,020 --> 0:21:53,820
 So yeah, it was transparent.

223
0:21:53,820 --> 0:22:03,500
 I just send enough pixels that it's not immediately, it is still visible.

224
0:22:03,500 --> 0:22:14,260
 So there was also a participant who attempted to create a distributed pixel flow client.

225
0:22:14,260 --> 0:22:22,980
 The goal was to play Doom on it, like with one controller and then multiple small machines

226
0:22:22,980 --> 0:22:31,340
 and stuff, the distributed distribution thing worked, but not playing Doom.

227
0:22:31,340 --> 0:22:35,480
 Maybe that will work next time.

228
0:22:35,480 --> 0:22:42,860
 So yes, I guess we can go to the game jam, and I will attempt to remember to announce

229
0:22:42,860 --> 0:22:45,860
 the winners of the token hunt.

230
0:22:45,860 --> 0:23:03,140
 Oh wait, I have to do this talk in English, then you understand.

231
0:23:03,140 --> 0:23:06,380
 We did the first ever bornhack game jam and it was a great success.

232
0:23:06,380 --> 0:23:11,620
 Thank you for everybody who played.

233
0:23:11,620 --> 0:23:15,380
 If you have your laptop out right now, you can go to pyjam.as slash game jam and see

234
0:23:15,380 --> 0:23:16,620
 all the submissions.

235
0:23:16,620 --> 0:23:23,220
 We had eight very beautiful games made by, I think, something like 15 nice hackers.

236
0:23:23,220 --> 0:23:28,620
 All of the games had to fit the theme switch, which was announced last Friday at 1800, and

237
0:23:28,620 --> 0:23:31,500
 then we had three days to complete the game.

238
0:23:31,500 --> 0:23:34,980
 The deadline was yesterday at 1800.

239
0:23:34,980 --> 0:23:38,660
 So since there's eight games, I just want to show you all of them because I couldn't

240
0:23:38,660 --> 0:23:40,140
 help myself.

241
0:23:40,140 --> 0:23:45,020
 This one, Killswitch by Vair, is really cool, it was made by a child, I think the first

242
0:23:45,020 --> 0:23:47,180
 time they ever made a game.

243
0:23:47,180 --> 0:23:50,820
 It's a switch, there's also some Nintendo switches and there's some networking switches

244
0:23:50,820 --> 0:23:54,260
 and there's a light switch, and you have to press one of three buttons and try and kill

245
0:23:54,260 --> 0:23:59,540
 the prisoner instead of the cops.

246
0:23:59,540 --> 0:24:00,540
 But it's very cool.

247
0:24:00,540 --> 0:24:06,020
 It plays in the web browser and it has a leaderboard.

248
0:24:06,020 --> 0:24:09,100
 Moral switch is gamifying the trolley problem.

249
0:24:09,100 --> 0:24:14,660
 Norske made a game which you're given a moral dilemma and you have to choose who you want

250
0:24:14,660 --> 0:24:15,780
 to kill.

251
0:24:15,780 --> 0:24:19,780
 The text was generated, I think, using a large language model and also images that were being

252
0:24:19,780 --> 0:24:24,020
 made on the fly so it would make at runtime new scenarios.

253
0:24:24,020 --> 0:24:26,820
 That's quite cool.

254
0:24:26,820 --> 0:24:29,540
 Somebody made a game called Past Parentheses 2.

255
0:24:29,540 --> 0:24:31,980
 I think they uploaded under the same name twice.

256
0:24:31,980 --> 0:24:36,700
 But this was Astron 1, Mast, Nielsen, Philip.

257
0:24:36,700 --> 0:24:40,780
 This is a game which had several different backend implementations.

258
0:24:40,780 --> 0:24:46,060
 So every time you die, you switch to a different backend which had its own complete different

259
0:24:46,060 --> 0:24:49,700
 state and different rules for the game.

260
0:24:49,700 --> 0:24:54,180
 Think there was backend written in Haskell and Go and Rust, right?

261
0:24:54,180 --> 0:24:56,420
 So that's kind of crazy.

262
0:24:56,420 --> 0:24:57,660
 So there's several different games.

263
0:24:57,660 --> 0:25:01,640
 There's one which is like a pixel art drawing game and this is a snake game.

264
0:25:01,640 --> 0:25:06,180
 This one turns out to be a lot of fun because there's an HTML injection in the username

265
0:25:06,660 --> 0:25:07,660
 field.

266
0:25:07,660 --> 0:25:09,860
 So you can just change the game on the fly.

267
0:25:09,860 --> 0:25:14,300
 Yeah, this website was looking really crazy last night because of the HTML injection.

268
0:25:14,300 --> 0:25:15,780
 That was cool.

269
0:25:15,780 --> 0:25:20,740
 Dowser made a game called Save the Network which is about defending a network switch.

270
0:25:20,740 --> 0:25:23,100
 You have all of these different ports.

271
0:25:23,100 --> 0:25:26,100
 Some of them, they turn red while they're being hacked.

272
0:25:26,100 --> 0:25:28,140
 So you have to be quick and click it.

273
0:25:28,140 --> 0:25:29,820
 So it's kind of like a whack-a-mole game.

274
0:25:29,820 --> 0:25:31,740
 This is super difficult.

275
0:25:31,740 --> 0:25:35,080
 But it has nice audio and stuff also.

276
0:25:35,080 --> 0:25:41,200
 Another cool game, Design Nuda, Nicolas made a game called Shield Switch in which it's

277
0:25:41,200 --> 0:25:46,840
 sort of like an asteroids type game where there's different types of asteroids.

278
0:25:46,840 --> 0:25:49,320
 It's difficult to see right now but these are like the red ones.

279
0:25:49,320 --> 0:25:54,400
 And then you switch between being in the red state or the blue state so you can phase through

280
0:25:54,400 --> 0:25:57,520
 different kinds of asteroids depending on what color it is.

281
0:25:57,520 --> 0:25:58,520
 That's quite cool.

282
0:25:58,520 --> 0:26:02,800
 Nicolas, who made this game, also composed an original soundtrack for this game and just

283
0:26:02,840 --> 0:26:06,200
 because he had more time and wanted to, he also made an original soundtrack for this

284
0:26:06,200 --> 0:26:07,280
 game.

285
0:26:07,280 --> 0:26:09,920
 So that's super cool.

286
0:26:09,920 --> 0:26:15,960
 This Sliding Snake is a terminal-based game in which you control a snake and you try and

287
0:26:15,960 --> 0:26:18,640
 avoid these lines of trees.

288
0:26:18,640 --> 0:26:24,440
 I think this was originally made to run on a receipt printer.

289
0:26:24,440 --> 0:26:26,760
 That's great.

290
0:26:26,760 --> 0:26:27,960
 This was my game.

291
0:26:27,960 --> 0:26:32,440
 It's like a physics-based game where you're the snake inside of your network switch because

292
0:26:32,440 --> 0:26:35,160
 you know the snake inside the network switch, right?

293
0:26:35,160 --> 0:26:40,320
 You pick up packets and you try and drop them in the right place and you try not to switch

294
0:26:40,320 --> 0:26:43,480
 the packets wrong.

295
0:26:43,480 --> 0:26:45,040
 Samuel made a game called Switch Off the Music.

296
0:26:45,040 --> 0:26:49,040
 This is a mobile phone game which is GPS-based, right?

297
0:26:49,040 --> 0:26:53,640
 So the plot is that it's late and all the hackers are making a lot of noise and you

298
0:26:53,640 --> 0:26:58,440
 have to go and find the parties and then tell them to turn off the music.

299
0:26:58,440 --> 0:27:02,400
 This game will get your heart rate up like you're sprinting around the field and trying

300
0:27:02,400 --> 0:27:06,120
 to turn off the music before you lose your patience.

301
0:27:06,120 --> 0:27:07,120
 That's a lot of fun.

302
0:27:07,120 --> 0:27:08,120
 All right.

303
0:27:08,120 --> 0:27:10,040
 So those were the games.

304
0:27:10,040 --> 0:27:12,280
 We had a rating system so it works like this.

305
0:27:12,280 --> 0:27:17,480
 Anybody who submitted a game could rate the other games.

306
0:27:17,480 --> 0:27:20,800
 We had a little bit less than 24 hours to play and rate all of them.

307
0:27:20,800 --> 0:27:21,800
 These are the categories.

308
0:27:21,800 --> 0:27:25,600
 There's an overall score that determines the winner of the game jam totally.

309
0:27:25,600 --> 0:27:30,260
 And then these are the aspects of creativity and aesthetics, how well it fit the theme

310
0:27:30,260 --> 0:27:33,960
 of Switch and how fun the gameplay was.

311
0:27:33,960 --> 0:27:38,300
 So let's do the winner's announcement for each of these categories.

312
0:27:38,300 --> 0:27:41,240
 The aesthetic winner is...

313
0:27:41,240 --> 0:27:49,540
 Mortal Switch!

314
0:27:49,540 --> 0:27:57,780
 The creativity winner is, I'm sure you're not surprised about this, Switch Off the Music!

315
0:27:57,780 --> 0:28:11,540
 The gameplay winner is Shield Switch!

316
0:28:11,540 --> 0:28:14,380
 And the theme winner is...

317
0:28:14,380 --> 0:28:17,380
 Mortal Switch!

318
0:28:17,380 --> 0:28:19,580
 Again!

319
0:28:19,580 --> 0:28:22,700
 All right can I have a drum roll for the total winner?

320
0:28:22,700 --> 0:28:33,120
 The winner of the Born Hack Game Jam 2023 is Shield Switch!

321
0:28:33,120 --> 0:28:35,660
 But really so much thanks to everybody who played.

322
0:28:35,660 --> 0:28:39,580
 It's been a lot of fun making games with you and we're definitely going to do this again

323
0:28:39,580 --> 0:28:41,580
 next year.

324
0:28:41,580 --> 0:28:45,780
 So there's a theme for the game jam which was Switch this year.

325
0:28:45,780 --> 0:28:49,420
 I'd really like to hear suggestions for a theme for next year.

326
0:28:49,500 --> 0:28:53,380
 The game jam Lulu Dare does this thing of submitting a bunch of different themes and then we vote

327
0:28:53,380 --> 0:28:54,380
 about it.

328
0:28:54,380 --> 0:28:55,380
 I think we should do that next year.

329
0:28:55,380 --> 0:28:59,180
 So send an email to the game team or send a message to me or just come find me if you

330
0:28:59,180 --> 0:29:01,120
 have a good idea for a theme.

331
0:29:01,120 --> 0:29:03,940
 Also I want to make it so that I don't know the theme in advance because that would be

332
0:29:03,940 --> 0:29:04,940
 more fun for me.

333
0:29:04,940 --> 0:29:07,940
 Yeah, but that's it for game jam.

334
0:29:07,940 --> 0:29:12,540
 Thanks for playing!

335
0:29:12,540 --> 0:29:20,860
 As you can see he's a bit more energetic than I am.

336
0:29:20,860 --> 0:29:24,100
 So yes, now the token hunt winner is...

337
0:29:24,100 --> 0:29:36,740
 Well, yeah, you have to play Rock, Paper, Scissors but it's Emilia and Sebastian.

338
0:29:36,740 --> 0:29:40,540
 You can decide amongst yourselves what you want to play Rock, Paper, Scissors.

339
0:29:40,540 --> 0:29:47,980
