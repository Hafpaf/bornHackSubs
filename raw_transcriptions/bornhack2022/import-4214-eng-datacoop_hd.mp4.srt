0:00:00,000 --> 0:00:23,080
 I arrived about two hours ago and I didn't know I was making a talk so I made these slides very fast.

2
0:00:30,000 --> 0:00:52,380
 Yeah, so I'm here to talk about Data Co-op and so briefly Data Co-op is an association

3
0:00:52,380 --> 0:00:59,360
 and formally we are based in Copenhagen but in reality we live on the internet.

4
0:01:00,000 --> 0:01:18,540
 So collectively we own two physical servers that we run together and we deliver services

5
0:01:18,540 --> 0:01:27,760
 to our members with a focus on privacy protection, encryption, zero knowledge and decentralization.

6
0:01:27,760 --> 0:01:28,760
 Okay.

7
0:01:28,760 --> 0:01:29,760
 Thank you.

8
0:01:29,760 --> 0:01:39,880
 This is really difficult.

9
0:01:39,880 --> 0:01:45,720
 So we offer email hosting.

10
0:01:45,720 --> 0:01:49,080
 Here's my email if you would like to get in touch.

11
0:01:49,080 --> 0:01:57,320
 We have a Git hosting using Gitia and Matrix chat.

12
0:01:57,320 --> 0:01:58,760
 And we have our main channel.

13
0:01:58,760 --> 0:01:59,760
 Okay.

14
0:01:59,760 --> 0:02:03,640
 So we are based in Copenhagen and we have a data Co-op on data.coop which is bridged

15
0:02:03,640 --> 0:02:09,880
 with Data Co-op on libera.chat, the IRC network.

16
0:02:09,880 --> 0:02:16,880
 Then we also recently got Mastodon at the domain social.data.coop.

17
0:02:16,880 --> 0:02:27,880
 And something new that I'm experimenting with is Mirasroas unikernels.

18
0:02:27,880 --> 0:02:28,880
 Small virtual machines for data.coop.

19
0:02:28,880 --> 0:02:28,960
 Okay.

20
0:02:28,960 --> 0:02:29,080
 Thank you.

21
0:02:29,080 --> 0:02:29,120
 Bye.

22
0:02:29,120 --> 0:02:29,160
 Bye.

23
0:02:29,160 --> 0:02:29,200
 Bye.

24
0:02:29,200 --> 0:02:29,220
 Bye.

25
0:02:29,220 --> 0:02:29,260
 Bye.

26
0:02:29,760 --> 0:02:30,420
 Bye.

27
0:02:30,420 --> 0:02:30,440
 Bye.

28
0:02:30,440 --> 0:02:30,480
 Bye.

29
0:02:30,480 --> 0:02:30,500
 Bye.

30
0:02:30,500 --> 0:02:30,520
 Bye.

31
0:02:30,520 --> 0:02:30,560
 Bye.

32
0:02:30,560 --> 0:02:30,600
 Bye.

33
0:02:30,600 --> 0:02:30,620
 Bye.

34
0:02:30,620 --> 0:02:31,060
 Bye.

35
0:02:31,060 --> 0:02:31,140
 Bye.

36
0:02:31,140 --> 0:02:31,160
 Bye.

37
0:02:31,160 --> 0:02:31,180
 Bye.

38
0:02:31,180 --> 0:02:31,200
 Bye.

39
0:02:31,200 --> 0:02:31,220
 Bye.

40
0:02:31,220 --> 0:02:31,260
 Bye.

41
0:02:31,260 --> 0:02:31,300
 Bye.

42
0:02:31,300 --> 0:02:31,320
 Bye.

43
0:02:31,320 --> 0:02:39,440
 And this website is also using that.

44
0:02:39,440 --> 0:02:44,400
 And we keep adding more services as we go.

45
0:02:50,400 --> 0:02:56,000
 So we have a membership of 300 kroners a year.

46
0:02:56,400 --> 0:02:59,120
 It seems I forgot to add that it's per year.

47
0:02:59,120 --> 0:02:59,460
 So we have a membership of 300 kroners a year.

48
0:02:59,460 --> 0:03:06,860
 And if you are students or unraged, we have a greatly reduced membership fee.

49
0:03:09,380 --> 0:03:14,960
 So the best place to check for how to become a member is on the website,

50
0:03:15,240 --> 0:03:22,460
 but the idea is you send us money and an email, and then you're a member.

51
0:03:24,860 --> 0:03:28,620
 Oh, and our website is data.coop.

52
0:03:29,460 --> 0:03:41,700
 So we have a meetup tonight at 11 o'clock in the bar,

53
0:03:42,160 --> 0:03:50,140
 so you can come and meet more of us and talk about Data Coop if you like.

54
0:03:59,460 --> 0:04:06,760
 Ah, I messed up the HTML.

55
0:04:16,600 --> 0:04:20,380
 Yeah, so it's hosted on a unikernel.

56
0:04:21,960 --> 0:04:25,580
 There's a Git repository with the slides.

57
0:04:26,300 --> 0:04:27,280
 It's horrible.

58
0:04:29,460 --> 0:04:31,300
 More or less valid HTML.

59
0:04:33,540 --> 0:04:43,880
 And we have our infrastructure set up using Ansible,

60
0:04:44,480 --> 0:04:51,620
 so you can check out how I made this website.

61
0:04:54,040 --> 0:04:55,920
 So some darker stuff.

62
0:04:56,520 --> 0:04:58,040
 Yeah, I think that's it.

63
0:04:58,460 --> 0:04:59,000
 Thank you.

64
0:04:59,460 --> 0:04:59,620
 Thank you.

65
0:04:59,620 --> 0:04:59,660
 Thank you.
