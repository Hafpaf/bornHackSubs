0:00:00,000 --> 0:00:15,300
 Good afternoon, everyone.

2
0:00:15,940 --> 0:00:17,560
 Yes, welcome to this talk.

3
0:00:17,700 --> 0:00:19,940
 My name is Henrik Kramselund, or Kramse for short.

4
0:00:20,460 --> 0:00:21,960
 My pronouns are he, him.

5
0:00:22,440 --> 0:00:26,120
 And all of my slideshows and educational materials are on GitHub.

6
0:00:26,620 --> 0:00:27,920
 My user, Kramse, at GitHub.

7
0:00:27,920 --> 0:00:30,900
 And this one is called Getting Started in InfoSec.

8
0:00:31,400 --> 0:00:33,240
 It's in the repository of security courses,

9
0:00:33,600 --> 0:00:36,300
 which have all my educational materials for everything I do.

10
0:00:36,780 --> 0:00:40,120
 So please share and use and get inspired if you like.

11
0:00:41,340 --> 0:00:42,760
 There's some contact information.

12
0:00:43,360 --> 0:00:47,860
 And just to sum it up, I've been using internet for many, many years.

13
0:00:47,940 --> 0:00:51,960
 I've been a network and security consultant for about 25 years plus.

14
0:00:52,280 --> 0:00:55,800
 I have gone through, of course, a lot of education myself.

15
0:00:56,120 --> 0:00:57,660
 And what I'm trying to do today

16
0:00:57,660 --> 0:01:01,120
 is try to get you started in a more nice way

17
0:01:01,120 --> 0:01:05,200
 because it can really be overwhelming getting to know security.

18
0:01:05,560 --> 0:01:08,100
 So I'm trying to get all of my experience

19
0:01:08,100 --> 0:01:12,020
 from the learning network and security myself, being a consultant,

20
0:01:12,360 --> 0:01:14,040
 but also when I teach at KEA,

21
0:01:14,120 --> 0:01:17,480
 which is the Copenhagen School of Design and Technology,

22
0:01:17,580 --> 0:01:18,980
 I think is the English name.

23
0:01:19,340 --> 0:01:20,960
 And I'm also a little bit of an activist,

24
0:01:21,120 --> 0:01:22,680
 but we can take that over a beer in the bar.

25
0:01:24,040 --> 0:01:26,680
 The goals for today is to inspire you,

26
0:01:27,660 --> 0:01:30,420
 to create a goal for your education.

27
0:01:31,240 --> 0:01:33,100
 We have this quote, the old one,

28
0:01:33,180 --> 0:01:34,740
 a goal without a plan is just a wish.

29
0:01:35,380 --> 0:01:40,420
 And trying to learn something as big as networking or security

30
0:01:40,420 --> 0:01:45,460
 or even the two together can be completely overwhelming.

31
0:01:45,900 --> 0:01:49,680
 So many resources are available, so many places to look,

32
0:01:49,780 --> 0:01:51,540
 so many people to listen to.

33
0:01:51,900 --> 0:01:55,040
 And everybody that has gone through this education by themselves

34
0:01:55,040 --> 0:01:56,500
 have, of course, experience.

35
0:01:57,660 --> 0:02:00,340
 And maybe it has not been the best way they learned it.

36
0:02:00,580 --> 0:02:02,580
 I learned it from some old obscure papers

37
0:02:02,580 --> 0:02:04,520
 that were not very easy to follow or read.

38
0:02:05,020 --> 0:02:07,420
 And there are much better resources today.

39
0:02:07,820 --> 0:02:10,720
 So I'm trying to point you to some of the resources that I'm using.

40
0:02:11,160 --> 0:02:13,780
 So mostly this will be inspired by things

41
0:02:13,780 --> 0:02:15,680
 that I actually do in my day-to-day work.

42
0:02:16,260 --> 0:02:19,740
 I'm also going to point you to a few core concepts

43
0:02:19,740 --> 0:02:21,880
 that I think you should know and learn.

44
0:02:22,480 --> 0:02:25,520
 And I'm quite stubborn in this regard.

45
0:02:25,520 --> 0:02:27,460
 I can be an old grumpy man sometimes,

46
0:02:27,660 --> 0:02:31,040
 but I really, really feel that there are some key points

47
0:02:31,040 --> 0:02:32,540
 that you need to learn

48
0:02:32,540 --> 0:02:35,000
 if you want to work in networking and security.

49
0:02:35,420 --> 0:02:37,340
 Some of them are just a need to know.

50
0:02:37,920 --> 0:02:39,720
 And if you don't know these things beforehand,

51
0:02:40,080 --> 0:02:43,520
 it will be much harder to go further in networking and security.

52
0:02:44,300 --> 0:02:46,160
 But if you, on the other hand,

53
0:02:46,540 --> 0:02:47,940
 acknowledge that this is needed,

54
0:02:48,180 --> 0:02:50,480
 a prerequisite for learning networking and security,

55
0:02:50,920 --> 0:02:55,260
 I think you will have a better experience

56
0:02:55,260 --> 0:02:57,640
 and will easily learn some of the more advanced,

57
0:02:57,660 --> 0:03:01,000
 and of course, we all want to learn the latest concepts,

58
0:03:01,180 --> 0:03:02,880
 but it can be really hard.

59
0:03:03,180 --> 0:03:06,600
 And even though I have been working in the industry for 25 years,

60
0:03:06,940 --> 0:03:09,360
 I have a master's from the University of Copenhagen.

61
0:03:09,760 --> 0:03:12,400
 There's definitely papers that I just browse.

62
0:03:12,800 --> 0:03:15,180
 There's definitely things I don't understand about security.

63
0:03:15,520 --> 0:03:19,180
 And there have been large parts of security that I never look at.

64
0:03:19,560 --> 0:03:21,300
 I'm never looking at Bluetooth security.

65
0:03:21,600 --> 0:03:23,260
 I'm not looking at infrared security.

66
0:03:23,260 --> 0:03:26,600
 I have just decided these big areas are not something

67
0:03:26,600 --> 0:03:27,640
 that I want to understand.

68
0:03:27,960 --> 0:03:28,960
 I don't want to invest the time.

69
0:03:28,960 --> 0:03:30,460
 I don't have the time available.

70
0:03:30,460 --> 0:03:35,460
 So I'm trying to inspire you to make a plan for your own wishes,

71
0:03:35,460 --> 0:03:36,960
 what you want to learn.

72
0:03:36,960 --> 0:03:38,660
 And as an inspiration,

73
0:03:38,660 --> 0:03:41,860
 I have taken a security engineering as a job role,

74
0:03:41,860 --> 0:03:48,360
 which is one of the things that you could use to guide your adventure into this,

75
0:03:48,360 --> 0:03:52,160
 depending on what kind of job role you currently find interesting.

76
0:03:52,160 --> 0:03:53,960
 They will have a list of wishes.

77
0:03:53,960 --> 0:03:57,180
 Again, they have a wish from the employer who they want to hire,

78
0:03:57,180 --> 0:04:00,280
 should have everything, and the kitchen sink,

79
0:04:00,280 --> 0:04:04,580
 and should be unicorns, and have these 50 years of experience.

80
0:04:04,580 --> 0:04:07,380
 And if they are young and agile without a family,

81
0:04:07,380 --> 0:04:10,680
 so they can work 100 hours a week, that would be great.

82
0:04:10,680 --> 0:04:15,780
 So sometimes getting to these job role and jobs that you can apply

83
0:04:15,780 --> 0:04:19,580
 for will have a list of things that you may want to learn.

84
0:04:20,080 --> 0:04:23,480
 And this is actually quite a large list, and it's a list

85
0:04:23,480 --> 0:04:26,580
 that actually includes many different fields within security.

86
0:04:26,580 --> 0:04:26,880
 Okay.

87
0:04:26,880 --> 0:04:29,980
 So having a person that can do all of this,

88
0:04:29,980 --> 0:04:33,080
 that's like really, really difficult to find.

89
0:04:33,080 --> 0:04:36,380
 And especially in Denmark, we have a shortage of security people.

90
0:04:36,380 --> 0:04:38,880
 So they are going to hire.

91
0:04:38,880 --> 0:04:41,780
 They are hiring people that don't have all of these skills.

92
0:04:41,780 --> 0:04:44,880
 So don't be discouraged from applying for a job,

93
0:04:44,880 --> 0:04:52,080
 even if you don't have all of these subjects as ready knowledge right now.

94
0:04:52,080 --> 0:04:56,280
 We can also go to some of the core concepts.

95
0:04:56,280 --> 0:05:00,780
 And go to some people that have done various categorization

96
0:05:00,780 --> 0:05:04,480
 of these fields of network security, network and security.

97
0:05:04,980 --> 0:05:09,380
 And one of the categorizations that I really love is the one

98
0:05:09,380 --> 0:05:12,080
 from the IC squared, the common body of knowledge.

99
0:05:12,280 --> 0:05:14,580
 It has been developed over lots of years.

100
0:05:14,880 --> 0:05:19,680
 So it's kind of a nice categorization of the fields

101
0:05:19,680 --> 0:05:23,080
 of network and security into more manageable,

102
0:05:23,280 --> 0:05:26,280
 they call them domains, other models will call it something,

103
0:05:26,280 --> 0:05:27,280
 something else.

104
0:05:27,280 --> 0:05:31,780
 But just by looking at categorizations and not trying to learn all of it

105
0:05:31,780 --> 0:05:34,280
 at the same time may help you.

106
0:05:34,280 --> 0:05:37,080
 So you can decide, I would start with this one,

107
0:05:37,080 --> 0:05:39,280
 which is the one that I know most about,

108
0:05:39,280 --> 0:05:41,980
 which will be easiest for me to get started in.

109
0:05:41,980 --> 0:05:45,080
 And some of these will be quite technical,

110
0:05:45,080 --> 0:05:47,780
 but actually some of them are not as technical.

111
0:05:47,780 --> 0:05:50,980
 So network and security is a technical field.

112
0:05:50,980 --> 0:05:53,780
 But in many ways, it's not a technical field.

113
0:05:53,780 --> 0:05:55,880
 There's a lot going on with security.

114
0:05:56,280 --> 0:06:00,280
 And I think this one, the eight domains of the CISSP,

115
0:06:00,280 --> 0:06:03,780
 common body of knowledge, is a nice way of structuring this.

116
0:06:03,780 --> 0:06:09,280
 So I came from a network, communications and network area

117
0:06:09,280 --> 0:06:10,280
 and loved networking.

118
0:06:10,280 --> 0:06:13,280
 So I went into communication and network security

119
0:06:13,280 --> 0:06:16,780
 and found it very easy to read some of these resources.

120
0:06:16,780 --> 0:06:19,280
 But when we get to like risk management,

121
0:06:19,280 --> 0:06:21,280
 that's not a preferred area for me.

122
0:06:21,280 --> 0:06:22,280
 So that's quite hard.

123
0:06:22,280 --> 0:06:25,280
 But I know some people in the audience are experts in that.

124
0:06:25,280 --> 0:06:27,280
 I'm looking at one in particular,

125
0:06:27,280 --> 0:06:29,780
 who's probably more of an expert in risk management,

126
0:06:29,780 --> 0:06:32,280
 talking to C-level executives.

127
0:06:32,280 --> 0:06:35,280
 And I don't like to talk to C-level executives.

128
0:06:35,280 --> 0:06:38,280
 I would rather talk to nerdy people about packets,

129
0:06:38,280 --> 0:06:40,280
 which is already in the program in my village.

130
0:06:40,280 --> 0:06:42,280
 Later today, we're going to be talking about packets

131
0:06:42,280 --> 0:06:45,280
 and protocols, 10G, playing with packets.

132
0:06:45,280 --> 0:06:47,280
 So I love that more.

133
0:06:47,280 --> 0:06:52,280
 But using these various taxonomies or models,

134
0:06:52,280 --> 0:06:55,280
 you can decide which subjects to look at first.

135
0:06:55,280 --> 0:07:00,280
 As an example, I have also taken this one,

136
0:07:00,280 --> 0:07:02,280
 which is called the Juniper Network Certifications.

137
0:07:02,280 --> 0:07:05,280
 Juniper Networks is a large provider of network equipment

138
0:07:05,280 --> 0:07:07,280
 being used across the world.

139
0:07:07,280 --> 0:07:08,280
 Cisco is another one.

140
0:07:08,280 --> 0:07:10,280
 All of these big companies,

141
0:07:10,280 --> 0:07:15,280
 they have a very advanced and big programs

142
0:07:15,280 --> 0:07:17,280
 for getting certifications in their products.

143
0:07:17,280 --> 0:07:20,280
 And I love certifications.

144
0:07:20,280 --> 0:07:23,280
 I enjoy certifications because they make you look

145
0:07:23,280 --> 0:07:24,280
 at some of the areas

146
0:07:24,280 --> 0:07:26,280
 that are not very common in the industry.

147
0:07:26,280 --> 0:07:28,280
 Whereas if you're working in the industry,

148
0:07:28,280 --> 0:07:30,280
 you will meet these three out of five things

149
0:07:30,280 --> 0:07:32,280
 that you always do in the network.

150
0:07:32,280 --> 0:07:34,280
 And then there will be four and five,

151
0:07:34,280 --> 0:07:36,280
 which you very rarely use.

152
0:07:36,280 --> 0:07:39,280
 But getting a certification sometimes helps me,

153
0:07:39,280 --> 0:07:41,280
 at least, to read up on some of the parts

154
0:07:41,280 --> 0:07:43,280
 that I don't use regularly.

155
0:07:43,280 --> 0:07:46,280
 But when they are useful, I will know about them enough

156
0:07:46,280 --> 0:07:50,280
 to be able to research them and apply them in real life.

157
0:07:50,280 --> 0:07:52,280
 So I enjoy certifications.

158
0:07:52,280 --> 0:07:54,280
 I'm not saying that you should take them

159
0:07:54,280 --> 0:07:57,280
 or take certifications or invest the money in that.

160
0:07:57,280 --> 0:07:59,280
 Some of them can be found freely.

161
0:07:59,280 --> 0:08:00,280
 Some of them are more easily.

162
0:08:00,280 --> 0:08:01,280
 You can find vouchers

163
0:08:01,280 --> 0:08:04,280
 for at least some of the entry-level ones.

164
0:08:04,280 --> 0:08:06,280
 And I know that definitely employers

165
0:08:06,280 --> 0:08:07,280
 will use certifications.

166
0:08:07,280 --> 0:08:08,280
 I love certifications

167
0:08:08,280 --> 0:08:12,280
 because it's easy to search for the recruiters.

168
0:08:12,280 --> 0:08:14,280
 We're talking about getting into security

169
0:08:14,280 --> 0:08:16,280
 probably because you want to get paid

170
0:08:16,280 --> 0:08:18,280
 doing what you love, network and security.

171
0:08:18,280 --> 0:08:20,280
 So certifications is one of the ways

172
0:08:20,280 --> 0:08:22,280
 to also get to know an area.

173
0:08:22,280 --> 0:08:24,280
 And as you can see in this one,

174
0:08:24,280 --> 0:08:27,280
 it's also divided into cloud and non-cloud stuff

175
0:08:27,280 --> 0:08:29,280
 and enterprise routing and switching

176
0:08:29,280 --> 0:08:33,280
 and service provider, ISP, routing and switching.

177
0:08:33,280 --> 0:08:36,280
 So depending on what area you want to work in,

178
0:08:36,280 --> 0:08:39,280
 it may be applicable to other certifications.

179
0:08:39,280 --> 0:08:43,280
 You can decide which track to follow.

180
0:08:43,280 --> 0:08:49,280
 Then I would like to go back a bit

181
0:08:49,280 --> 0:08:53,280
 and restart how to learn network and security.

182
0:08:53,280 --> 0:08:55,280
 And I think some of this applies

183
0:08:55,280 --> 0:08:57,280
 to probably other technical skills

184
0:08:57,280 --> 0:09:01,280
 that you want to get to know.

185
0:09:01,280 --> 0:09:04,280
 I call it learning at different levels.

186
0:09:04,280 --> 0:09:06,280
 And as an example,

187
0:09:06,280 --> 0:09:10,280
 I will use the tool called the Nmap port scanner.

188
0:09:10,280 --> 0:09:13,280
 It's included in the movie, the Matrix movie,

189
0:09:13,280 --> 0:09:15,280
 which is one of the famous hacker movies.

190
0:09:15,280 --> 0:09:17,280
 There's been a bit of hacking in that.

191
0:09:17,280 --> 0:09:19,280
 They are running a tool called Nmap.

192
0:09:19,280 --> 0:09:20,280
 It's actually a real tool.

193
0:09:20,280 --> 0:09:21,280
 So it's one of the hacker movies

194
0:09:21,280 --> 0:09:22,280
 that include a real tool.

195
0:09:22,280 --> 0:09:24,280
 They are typing quickly

196
0:09:24,280 --> 0:09:27,280
 with gloves on and fancy clothes,

197
0:09:27,280 --> 0:09:30,280
 but it is actually a very useful tool.

198
0:09:30,280 --> 0:09:32,280
 It's also one of the tools

199
0:09:32,280 --> 0:09:36,280
 that I think is a need to know tool

200
0:09:36,280 --> 0:09:39,280
 because everybody is using Nmap.

201
0:09:39,280 --> 0:09:42,280
 You will not have a pen test in the world

202
0:09:42,280 --> 0:09:44,280
 that doesn't use Nmap,

203
0:09:44,280 --> 0:09:46,280
 or at least I would not consider that a pen test.

204
0:09:46,280 --> 0:09:49,280
 I would not consider that a good pen test.

205
0:09:49,280 --> 0:09:50,280
 Everybody will use Nmap

206
0:09:50,280 --> 0:09:52,280
 and they may use other tools,

207
0:09:52,280 --> 0:09:54,280
 but Nmap is a port scanner

208
0:09:54,280 --> 0:09:56,280
 that can check for open ports on the internet.

209
0:09:56,280 --> 0:09:58,280
 And you can perhaps scan a little bit here.

210
0:09:58,280 --> 0:10:01,280
 I'm pretty sure that we will get abuse messages

211
0:10:01,280 --> 0:10:04,280
 if you try to scan the whole internet from here.

212
0:10:04,280 --> 0:10:06,280
 And since I don't know who you are,

213
0:10:06,280 --> 0:10:08,280
 I cannot really forward those abuse messages,

214
0:10:08,280 --> 0:10:11,280
 but you can do some light scanning from here.

215
0:10:11,280 --> 0:10:13,280
 And all of you in the tent here,

216
0:10:13,280 --> 0:10:15,280
 at least you're very welcome

217
0:10:15,280 --> 0:10:18,280
 to practice Nmap scanning on my infrastructure.

218
0:10:18,280 --> 0:10:21,280
 I have the AS number 57860.

219
0:10:22,280 --> 0:10:24,280
 You can scan all my devices using Nmap from here

220
0:10:24,280 --> 0:10:26,280
 if you like to and want to play with this.

221
0:10:26,280 --> 0:10:29,280
 So this is an example of a must-have tool,

222
0:10:29,280 --> 0:10:30,280
 must-learn tool,

223
0:10:30,280 --> 0:10:32,280
 must be able to talk about this tool

224
0:10:32,280 --> 0:10:35,280
 and understand the output from this tool.

225
0:10:35,280 --> 0:10:36,280
 Because in this screenshot,

226
0:10:36,280 --> 0:10:39,280
 we are seeing them run the tool with some options.

227
0:10:39,280 --> 0:10:42,280
 We are seeing some output from this.

228
0:10:42,280 --> 0:10:43,280
 And at the very bottom,

229
0:10:43,280 --> 0:10:45,280
 I'm not sure you can read it at the back,

230
0:10:45,280 --> 0:10:47,280
 there's actually an exploit being used.

231
0:10:47,280 --> 0:10:48,280
 And in the movie,

232
0:10:48,280 --> 0:10:50,280
 they gain access to controlling the power

233
0:10:50,280 --> 0:10:52,280
 and can shut the whole thing down.

234
0:10:52,280 --> 0:10:55,280
 But understanding the output

235
0:10:55,280 --> 0:10:57,280
 can be just as difficult

236
0:10:57,280 --> 0:10:59,280
 as actually running the tool.

237
0:10:59,280 --> 0:11:00,280
 And in this case,

238
0:11:00,280 --> 0:11:02,280
 using Nmap as an example,

239
0:11:02,280 --> 0:11:05,280
 this tool has about 100 options.

240
0:11:05,280 --> 0:11:07,280
 And if you don't even know Linux,

241
0:11:07,280 --> 0:11:09,280
 you don't even know command line tools,

242
0:11:09,280 --> 0:11:11,280
 then it will be even an obstacle

243
0:11:11,280 --> 0:11:13,280
 to getting to run this tool.

244
0:11:13,280 --> 0:11:15,280
 It has 100 options.

245
0:11:15,280 --> 0:11:16,280
 But then you can look at the man page

246
0:11:16,280 --> 0:11:17,280
 because the man page

247
0:11:17,280 --> 0:11:19,280
 for all of these Unix, Linux tools,

248
0:11:19,280 --> 0:11:20,280
 command line tools

249
0:11:20,280 --> 0:11:21,280
 will of course explain

250
0:11:21,280 --> 0:11:23,280
 how to use the tool.

251
0:11:23,280 --> 0:11:26,280
 And then you can read these 3,100 lines

252
0:11:26,280 --> 0:11:28,280
 about how to use these options.

253
0:11:28,280 --> 0:11:31,280
 And this tool is actually so complex

254
0:11:31,280 --> 0:11:32,280
 that multiple books

255
0:11:32,280 --> 0:11:34,280
 have been written about the tool.

256
0:11:34,280 --> 0:11:35,280
 Some of them are outdated,

257
0:11:35,280 --> 0:11:37,280
 but some of the basic stuff

258
0:11:37,280 --> 0:11:39,280
 is still available and useful

259
0:11:39,280 --> 0:11:40,280
 and in the tool still.

260
0:11:40,280 --> 0:11:41,280
 And of course,

261
0:11:41,280 --> 0:11:42,280
 it has also been expanded

262
0:11:42,280 --> 0:11:44,280
 with IP version 6.

263
0:11:44,280 --> 0:11:46,280
 So that adds another dimension.

264
0:11:46,280 --> 0:11:48,280
 But which of the 100 options

265
0:11:48,280 --> 0:11:49,280
 should you use?

266
0:11:49,280 --> 0:11:51,280
 How do you interpret it?

267
0:11:51,280 --> 0:11:52,280
 How do you interpret the results

268
0:11:52,280 --> 0:11:53,280
 from this tool?

269
0:11:55,280 --> 0:11:57,280
 Looking at this specific tool,

270
0:11:57,280 --> 0:11:59,280
 using this as an example,

271
0:11:59,280 --> 0:12:01,280
 there are some prerequisite knowledge

272
0:12:01,280 --> 0:12:02,280
 to using it.

273
0:12:02,280 --> 0:12:05,280
 And to actually use it effectively

274
0:12:05,280 --> 0:12:07,280
 in a job role,

275
0:12:07,280 --> 0:12:08,280
 in an enterprise,

276
0:12:08,280 --> 0:12:10,280
 in an organization,

277
0:12:10,280 --> 0:12:12,280
 you will need to combine some knowledge.

278
0:12:12,280 --> 0:12:15,280
 So to get started using this Nmap,

279
0:12:15,280 --> 0:12:17,280
 you need to have some

280
0:12:17,280 --> 0:12:19,280
 prerequisite knowledge.

281
0:12:19,280 --> 0:12:21,280
 And the prerequisite knowledge is

282
0:12:21,280 --> 0:12:23,280
 what is a port scanner?

283
0:12:23,280 --> 0:12:24,280
 And what is a port scanner?

284
0:12:24,280 --> 0:12:27,280
 It's something to do with TCP IP.

285
0:12:27,280 --> 0:12:29,280
 But what is TCP IP?

286
0:12:29,280 --> 0:12:31,280
 Transmission Control Protocol

287
0:12:31,280 --> 0:12:33,280
 slash IP Internet Protocol.

288
0:12:33,280 --> 0:12:35,280
 It's part of the Internet Protocol Suite.

289
0:12:35,280 --> 0:12:36,280
 And actually,

290
0:12:36,280 --> 0:12:37,280
 that whole suite includes

291
0:12:37,280 --> 0:12:38,280
 a lot of functionality.

292
0:12:38,280 --> 0:12:39,280
 It's being used

293
0:12:39,280 --> 0:12:40,280
 across the whole Internet.

294
0:12:40,280 --> 0:12:41,280
 It's being used

295
0:12:41,280 --> 0:12:42,280
 for multiple purposes.

296
0:12:42,280 --> 0:12:43,280
 It's being used

297
0:12:43,280 --> 0:12:45,280
 for HTTP port 80.

298
0:12:45,280 --> 0:12:46,280
 How many in here know

299
0:12:46,280 --> 0:12:49,280
 HTTP and web service browsers?

300
0:12:49,280 --> 0:12:50,280
 How many has run a browser?

301
0:12:50,280 --> 0:12:51,280
 Yeah.

302
0:12:51,280 --> 0:12:53,280
 Trying to activate you a bit.

303
0:12:53,280 --> 0:12:54,280
 So getting to know a browser,

304
0:12:54,280 --> 0:12:55,280
 having a little bit to know

305
0:12:55,280 --> 0:12:57,280
 with web technologies,

306
0:12:57,280 --> 0:12:59,280
 some of the people moving into security

307
0:12:59,280 --> 0:13:01,280
 may come from a web developer background.

308
0:13:01,280 --> 0:13:02,280
 So you will know

309
0:13:02,280 --> 0:13:04,280
 HTTP port 80.

310
0:13:04,280 --> 0:13:05,280
 And some of you may know

311
0:13:05,280 --> 0:13:06,280
 that it runs on TCP.

312
0:13:06,280 --> 0:13:07,280
 And now we already know

313
0:13:07,280 --> 0:13:09,280
 a little bit more about

314
0:13:09,280 --> 0:13:10,280
 what to expect

315
0:13:10,280 --> 0:13:11,280
 when we do the scanning

316
0:13:11,280 --> 0:13:12,280
 because of course

317
0:13:12,280 --> 0:13:14,280
 we will see web servers.

318
0:13:14,280 --> 0:13:15,280
 But we need to know

319
0:13:15,280 --> 0:13:17,280
 some basic stuff

320
0:13:17,280 --> 0:13:18,280
 before we can use

321
0:13:18,280 --> 0:13:19,280
 a port scanner effectively.

322
0:13:19,280 --> 0:13:22,280
 We also need to know

323
0:13:22,280 --> 0:13:24,280
 a bit of the inside

324
0:13:24,280 --> 0:13:25,280
 and internals

325
0:13:25,280 --> 0:13:26,280
 of the Internet protocol suite.

326
0:13:26,280 --> 0:13:27,280
 There's something called

327
0:13:27,280 --> 0:13:29,280
 a TCP session setup.

328
0:13:29,280 --> 0:13:31,280
 So you need to research

329
0:13:31,280 --> 0:13:33,280
 how does TCP actually work.

330
0:13:33,280 --> 0:13:35,280
 It works by sending a packet

331
0:13:35,280 --> 0:13:36,280
 called a SYN packet

332
0:13:36,280 --> 0:13:37,280
 and then it gets

333
0:13:37,280 --> 0:13:38,280
 a SYN ACK packet back

334
0:13:38,280 --> 0:13:39,280
 and then it sends an ACK.

335
0:13:39,280 --> 0:13:41,280
 And then you can actually

336
0:13:41,280 --> 0:13:43,280
 start sending a GET request

337
0:13:43,280 --> 0:13:44,280
 and get a web page back

338
0:13:44,280 --> 0:13:45,280
 from a web server.

339
0:13:45,280 --> 0:13:46,280
 And that happens

340
0:13:46,280 --> 0:13:47,280
 every time we use TCP.

341
0:13:47,280 --> 0:13:48,280
 And that is some of the things

342
0:13:48,280 --> 0:13:49,280
 that you need to know

343
0:13:49,280 --> 0:13:50,280
 before you can run NMAP

344
0:13:50,280 --> 0:13:51,280
 and understand the output.

345
0:13:51,280 --> 0:13:52,280
 Then you want to run the tool

346
0:13:52,280 --> 0:13:53,280
 and running tools like NMAP

347
0:13:53,280 --> 0:13:54,280
 requires some kind of platform

348
0:13:54,280 --> 0:13:55,280
 operating system.

349
0:13:55,280 --> 0:13:56,280
 It's usually not built

350
0:13:56,280 --> 0:13:57,280
 into your operating system

351
0:13:57,280 --> 0:13:58,280
 when you download it.

352
0:13:58,280 --> 0:13:59,280
 You buy it by a laptop.

353
0:13:59,280 --> 0:14:00,280
 I don't think there's ever

354
0:14:00,280 --> 0:14:01,280
 a laptop that has NMAP

355
0:14:01,280 --> 0:14:02,280
 by default.

356
0:14:02,280 --> 0:14:03,280
 They should have.

357
0:14:03,280 --> 0:14:04,280
 They should have

358
0:14:04,280 --> 0:14:05,280
 in my opinion.

359
0:14:05,280 --> 0:14:06,280
 It's one of the first tools

360
0:14:06,280 --> 0:14:07,280
 that I always install.

361
0:14:07,280 --> 0:14:08,280
 But luckily

362
0:14:08,280 --> 0:14:09,280
 this tool

363
0:14:09,280 --> 0:14:10,280
 that I always use

364
0:14:10,280 --> 0:14:11,280
 is actually

365
0:14:11,280 --> 0:14:12,280
 one of the first

366
0:14:12,280 --> 0:14:13,280
 tools that I use

367
0:14:13,280 --> 0:14:14,280
 to run NMAP.

368
0:14:14,280 --> 0:14:15,280
 It's actually

369
0:14:15,280 --> 0:14:16,280
 one of the first

370
0:14:16,280 --> 0:14:17,280
 tools that I use

371
0:14:17,280 --> 0:14:18,280
 to run NMAP.

372
0:14:18,280 --> 0:14:19,280
 This tool

373
0:14:19,280 --> 0:14:20,280
 which is one of the reasons

374
0:14:20,280 --> 0:14:21,280
 I also really,

375
0:14:21,280 --> 0:14:22,280
 really love this tool.

376
0:14:22,280 --> 0:14:23,280
 It is that

377
0:14:23,280 --> 0:14:24,280
 it supports Mac,

378
0:14:24,280 --> 0:14:25,280
 Windows,

379
0:14:25,280 --> 0:14:26,280
 Linux.

380
0:14:26,280 --> 0:14:27,280
 It's open source.

381
0:14:27,280 --> 0:14:28,280
 You can compile it

382
0:14:28,280 --> 0:14:29,280
 and run it on a mobile phone

383
0:14:29,280 --> 0:14:30,280
 if you like.

384
0:14:30,280 --> 0:14:31,280
 It's available

385
0:14:31,280 --> 0:14:32,280
 for all of us.

386
0:14:32,280 --> 0:14:33,280
 So that sorts out

387
0:14:33,280 --> 0:14:34,280
 one of the prerequisites

388
0:14:34,280 --> 0:14:35,280
 for the hardware

389
0:14:35,280 --> 0:14:36,280
 that you need.

390
0:14:36,280 --> 0:14:37,280
 But then also

391
0:14:37,280 --> 0:14:38,280
 NMAP

392
0:14:38,280 --> 0:14:39,280
 we are very lucky

393
0:14:39,280 --> 0:14:40,280
 because it has a

394
0:14:40,280 --> 0:14:41,280
 GUI front end

395
0:14:41,280 --> 0:14:42,280
 which is called

396
0:14:42,280 --> 0:14:43,280
 send map

397
0:14:43,280 --> 0:14:44,280
 which is the screenshot

398
0:14:44,280 --> 0:14:45,280
 shown here.

399
0:14:45,280 --> 0:14:46,280
 So if you're

400
0:14:46,280 --> 0:14:47,280
 a bit afraid

401
0:14:47,280 --> 0:14:48,280
 of command line

402
0:14:48,280 --> 0:14:49,280
 options,

403
0:14:49,280 --> 0:14:50,280
 that's great.

404
0:14:50,280 --> 0:14:51,280
 You can still run NMAP

405
0:14:51,280 --> 0:14:52,280
 and I recommend

406
0:14:52,280 --> 0:14:53,280
 people new to NMAP

407
0:14:53,280 --> 0:14:54,280
 to run this GUI tool.

408
0:14:54,280 --> 0:14:55,280
 And it's also

409
0:14:55,280 --> 0:14:56,280
 a very,

410
0:14:56,280 --> 0:14:57,280
 very nice

411
0:14:57,280 --> 0:14:58,280
 GUI tool

412
0:14:58,280 --> 0:14:59,280
 for learning NMAP

413
0:14:59,280 --> 0:15:00,280
 because it has profiles.

414
0:15:00,280 --> 0:15:01,280
 It has a way

415
0:15:01,280 --> 0:15:02,280
 to use the GUI

416
0:15:02,280 --> 0:15:03,280
 to select options.

417
0:15:03,280 --> 0:15:04,280
 There's a bit of explanation

418
0:15:04,280 --> 0:15:05,280
 for all of these options.

419
0:15:05,280 --> 0:15:06,280
 But also

420
0:15:06,280 --> 0:15:07,280
 this tool

421
0:15:07,280 --> 0:15:08,280
 actually

422
0:15:08,280 --> 0:15:09,280
 includes

423
0:15:09,280 --> 0:15:10,280
 the full command

424
0:15:10,280 --> 0:15:11,280
 that is running.

425
0:15:11,280 --> 0:15:12,280
 It's a bit

426
0:15:12,280 --> 0:15:13,280
 mangled

427
0:15:13,280 --> 0:15:14,280
 but you can see

428
0:15:14,280 --> 0:15:15,280
 NMAP

429
0:15:15,280 --> 0:15:16,280
 minus T4

430
0:15:16,280 --> 0:15:17,280
 minus A

431
0:15:17,280 --> 0:15:18,280
 minus V

432
0:15:18,280 --> 0:15:19,280
 and so on.

433
0:15:19,280 --> 0:15:20,280
 So it's actually

434
0:15:20,280 --> 0:15:21,280
 a nice tool

435
0:15:21,280 --> 0:15:22,280
 for learning.

436
0:15:22,280 --> 0:15:23,280
 But if you

437
0:15:23,280 --> 0:15:24,280
 start out

438
0:15:24,280 --> 0:15:25,280
 by watching

439
0:15:25,280 --> 0:15:26,280
 a movie

440
0:15:26,280 --> 0:15:27,280
 with techno music

441
0:15:27,280 --> 0:15:28,280
 and they're just

442
0:15:28,280 --> 0:15:29,280
 switching back and forth

443
0:15:29,280 --> 0:15:30,280
 between command lines

444
0:15:30,280 --> 0:15:31,280
 and running a lot

445
0:15:31,280 --> 0:15:32,280
 of options

446
0:15:32,280 --> 0:15:33,280
 it can be really hard

447
0:15:33,280 --> 0:15:34,280
 to learn this tool.

448
0:15:34,280 --> 0:15:35,280
 So running a port scanner

449
0:15:35,280 --> 0:15:36,280
 you need to have

450
0:15:36,280 --> 0:15:37,280
 a platform.

451
0:15:37,280 --> 0:15:38,280
 My recommendation

452
0:15:38,280 --> 0:15:39,280
 is to create

453
0:15:39,280 --> 0:15:40,280
 a virtual machine

454
0:15:40,280 --> 0:15:41,280
 with Kali Linux.

455
0:15:41,280 --> 0:15:42,280
 We can discuss

456
0:15:42,280 --> 0:15:43,280
 in another

457
0:15:43,280 --> 0:15:44,280
 area

458
0:15:44,280 --> 0:15:45,280
 which offensive

459
0:15:45,280 --> 0:15:46,280
 Linux distribution

460
0:15:46,280 --> 0:15:47,280
 to use

461
0:15:47,280 --> 0:15:48,280
 and there are some

462
0:15:48,280 --> 0:15:53,160
 do Bluetooth hacking, wireless hacking, SDR hacking, maybe some other Linux distribution

463
0:15:53,160 --> 0:15:55,700
 may be better for that purpose.

464
0:15:55,860 --> 0:16:01,160
 But the Kali Linux has been downloaded millions and millions and millions of copies and installed

465
0:16:01,160 --> 0:16:02,000
 around the world.

466
0:16:02,580 --> 0:16:09,320
 There are YouTube videos, more than 100,000 YouTube videos in different languages, with

467
0:16:09,320 --> 0:16:10,100
 different accents.

468
0:16:10,540 --> 0:16:11,960
 There are some in Danish even.

469
0:16:12,300 --> 0:16:14,060
 Some of them will be short, five minutes.

470
0:16:14,360 --> 0:16:15,660
 Some of them will be 15 minutes.

471
0:16:15,660 --> 0:16:18,520
 Some of them will be hour-long videos about Nmap.

472
0:16:19,060 --> 0:16:24,640
 So use the right resources, and Kali Linux makes it very easy, because then this tool

473
0:16:24,640 --> 0:16:25,580
 is actually installed.

474
0:16:26,100 --> 0:16:30,500
 So if you can follow the guide to install Kali Linux, which is also documented by YouTube

475
0:16:30,500 --> 0:16:33,220
 videos, then you have a platform to run the tool.

476
0:16:34,560 --> 0:16:41,600
 Then later on, when we have the basic stuff, we know how to run the tool, we need to apply

477
0:16:41,600 --> 0:16:43,020
 it in a job role.

478
0:16:43,020 --> 0:16:45,640
 And that is where it starts to become useful.

479
0:16:45,660 --> 0:16:49,060
 And you can actually start to use it in different scenarios.

480
0:16:49,980 --> 0:16:55,580
 Using scenarios is a way of, for me at least, and my students, to say we want to perform

481
0:16:55,580 --> 0:16:56,540
 some task.

482
0:16:57,080 --> 0:17:04,080
 And I have included a list of tasks that I have used in real penetration testing scenarios.

483
0:17:04,460 --> 0:17:08,060
 So I may want to do a full TCP scan, which is the first line.

484
0:17:08,520 --> 0:17:14,320
 So this is actually a specific invocation of this tool with specific options that will

485
0:17:14,320 --> 0:17:15,380
 produce an output file.

486
0:17:15,380 --> 0:17:23,080
 And then later on, in some of these, there will be all sorts of magical constants around

487
0:17:23,080 --> 0:17:28,900
 these commands that you may not know now, but splitting it up into different scenarios

488
0:17:28,900 --> 0:17:33,380
 and trying to work through each of these scenarios will start to make it useful.

489
0:17:34,340 --> 0:17:40,600
 And the first one with Nmap for all ports with the TCP, that's actually one of the commands

490
0:17:40,600 --> 0:17:44,200
 that some of my students have used in their home networks.

491
0:17:44,200 --> 0:17:45,200
 They have applied this.

492
0:17:45,380 --> 0:17:48,860
 They have applied this knowledge of scanning all the ports, just getting an output of the

493
0:17:48,860 --> 0:17:49,860
 open ports.

494
0:17:49,860 --> 0:17:54,500
 And in one case, one of them came back and there was a MariaDB, which was a SQL database

495
0:17:54,500 --> 0:17:57,000
 just connected directly to the internet.

496
0:17:57,000 --> 0:18:02,460
 Found out it was a consultant that needed access a year ago, and nobody removed the

497
0:18:02,460 --> 0:18:04,460
 access afterwards.

498
0:18:04,460 --> 0:18:10,540
 And that is things that you can start to use pretty easily and pretty quickly after learning

499
0:18:10,540 --> 0:18:11,900
 the basic stuff.

500
0:18:11,900 --> 0:18:15,220
 So I hope that describes the process of getting to know a synchro.

501
0:18:15,220 --> 0:18:16,900
 So I hope that describes the process of getting to know a single tool, getting started with

502
0:18:16,900 --> 0:18:21,460
 a single tool, and then you can expand on that knowledge.

503
0:18:21,460 --> 0:18:26,240
 So there's no reason to go and read all the options for Nmap because you don't need all

504
0:18:26,240 --> 0:18:32,340
 the options, especially there's a large part of Nmap options that has to do with being

505
0:18:32,340 --> 0:18:37,620
 a bit, what you call it, hiding who you are, spoofing addresses and stuff.

506
0:18:37,620 --> 0:18:42,700
 And if you are allowed to do Nmap, which is quite easy to get access to if you have a

507
0:18:42,700 --> 0:18:43,700
 network.

508
0:18:43,700 --> 0:18:46,380
 If you're running in a lab network, you can run it.

509
0:18:46,380 --> 0:18:49,020
 So we don't need these options immediately.

510
0:18:49,020 --> 0:18:52,080
 And some of them actually don't work really well anymore.

511
0:18:52,080 --> 0:18:57,440
 So I just recommend getting permission to run Nmap, and that's actually quite useful.

512
0:18:57,440 --> 0:19:02,700
 And try it out in a lab environment or some camp that you make with your friends in a

513
0:19:02,700 --> 0:19:03,800
 forest.

514
0:19:03,800 --> 0:19:07,680
 You can try out Nmap on a network.

515
0:19:07,680 --> 0:19:13,140
 So this is actually what I would recommend as a quality scan of an enterprise if you

516
0:19:13,140 --> 0:19:18,200
 did these scans, took all the output, focused on the output for the different parts.

517
0:19:18,200 --> 0:19:21,600
 That would actually be quite useful in many circumstances.

518
0:19:21,600 --> 0:19:24,760
 There's one called SSH scan, which scans for port 22.

519
0:19:24,760 --> 0:19:30,740
 22 is of course an administration port for Linux machines and other Unix-like systems.

520
0:19:30,740 --> 0:19:34,600
 And that is actually by itself very important and interesting.

521
0:19:34,600 --> 0:19:36,920
 Who can SSH to our machines?

522
0:19:36,920 --> 0:19:41,440
 And then you can ask people to say, hmm, maybe the whole internet does not need access to

523
0:19:41,440 --> 0:19:43,140
 SSH on our ports.

524
0:19:43,140 --> 0:19:46,020
 Or machines, because then they can try logging in.

525
0:19:46,020 --> 0:19:50,160
 And actually when you put something on the internet, people will try to log into SSH

526
0:19:50,160 --> 0:19:52,100
 immediately within minutes.

527
0:19:52,100 --> 0:19:53,580
 You can try it here on camp.

528
0:19:53,580 --> 0:19:58,160
 Put a machine on an IP that has not been active for a week, and immediately within minutes

529
0:19:58,160 --> 0:20:03,040
 you will see attacks on these ports.

530
0:20:03,040 --> 0:20:09,680
 Going back to some of the categorization, I also try to structure my learning, my teaching

531
0:20:09,680 --> 0:20:13,100
 into kind of following the OSI model.

532
0:20:13,140 --> 0:20:17,840
 Because the OSI model and the Internet Protocol Suite model goes from some physical layers

533
0:20:17,840 --> 0:20:19,800
 and up through the protocols.

534
0:20:19,800 --> 0:20:24,600
 And in many cases, I think it makes sense to secure the lower layers before the upper

535
0:20:24,600 --> 0:20:25,600
 layers.

536
0:20:25,600 --> 0:20:32,540
 So, for instance, removing the possibility of accessing port 22 makes it, it doesn't

537
0:20:32,540 --> 0:20:37,060
 care, we don't care if there's a bad password if you cannot get access to that port.

538
0:20:37,060 --> 0:20:42,820
 So securing the internet and the network from below is my recommended way, and you can also

539
0:20:42,820 --> 0:20:45,780
 use that in your learning if you want to get started.

540
0:20:45,780 --> 0:20:49,660
 Start from some of the lower levels, understand what's going on, and then of course you get

541
0:20:49,660 --> 0:20:53,900
 to some of the higher levels and different applications where it splits out.

542
0:20:53,900 --> 0:20:58,480
 And I can tell you there are hacking tools for all applications, all protocols, so even

543
0:20:58,480 --> 0:21:07,700
 if it's a niche technology, there will be some kind of hacking tool for that niche.

544
0:21:07,700 --> 0:21:12,440
 Already I have asked you to do a lot of different things, and it is difficult to get to know

545
0:21:12,440 --> 0:21:17,860
 all of these things without drowning, and one of the bad things is if you try to bite

546
0:21:17,860 --> 0:21:23,700
 over too much immediately, but there are some things that you need to know at a certain

547
0:21:23,700 --> 0:21:29,880
 point to be able to run security and network and scanning and doing all sorts of other

548
0:21:29,880 --> 0:21:30,880
 stuff.

549
0:21:30,880 --> 0:21:34,820
 And I actually believe some of these things should also be taught to some of our bosses,

550
0:21:34,820 --> 0:21:38,800
 some of our management should at least know some of these things, because then they would

551
0:21:38,800 --> 0:21:41,400
 be better at enforcing security.

552
0:21:41,400 --> 0:21:42,400
 So.

553
0:21:42,440 --> 0:21:47,340
 You need to know a little bit of basic protocols, and it may not be that interesting to read

554
0:21:47,340 --> 0:21:52,460
 about that, but that will make it much easier to understand NMAP output, but it will also

555
0:21:52,460 --> 0:21:58,680
 make it much easier to understand the output of a $5,000 tool, because it runs NMAP at

556
0:21:58,680 --> 0:22:03,960
 the bottom, it will report the same information as the NMAP tool in many cases.

557
0:22:03,960 --> 0:22:08,080
 And without this knowledge about the basic protocols, then you won't be able to understand

558
0:22:08,080 --> 0:22:11,100
 what's going on in these $5,000 tools.

559
0:22:11,100 --> 0:22:12,100
 And it's not a joke.

560
0:22:12,100 --> 0:22:17,760
 Some of these commercial pen testing tools actually cost $5,000, which is why a lot of

561
0:22:17,760 --> 0:22:21,380
 people in Denmark at least are not allowed to buy them.

562
0:22:21,380 --> 0:22:23,660
 So you need to know a little bit about Ethernet.

563
0:22:23,660 --> 0:22:26,100
 You can practice Ethernet on a camp like this.

564
0:22:26,100 --> 0:22:28,980
 You can connect to the network and can put up a Raspberry Pi.

565
0:22:28,980 --> 0:22:32,920
 You can see the Raspberry Pi getting hacked, and then you can turn it off and that was

566
0:22:32,920 --> 0:22:35,080
 fun and you can drink a beer at the bar.

567
0:22:35,080 --> 0:22:40,100
 And then you can reset the flash card and put in something different with a better password,

568
0:22:40,100 --> 0:22:41,900
 and then probably it won't get hacked.

569
0:22:42,100 --> 0:22:46,960
 You need to know a little bit about IPv4 and ICMP, which are some of the lower level

570
0:22:46,960 --> 0:22:50,700
 protocols, but you can later add Wi-Fi.

571
0:22:50,700 --> 0:22:53,080
 So you don't have to learn Wi-Fi immediately.

572
0:22:53,080 --> 0:22:56,220
 So some things are also okay to push to a later time.

573
0:22:56,220 --> 0:23:02,580
 And IPv6, even though I wrote my thesis about IPv6 20 years ago, and I love IPv6, you don't

574
0:23:02,580 --> 0:23:08,760
 have to learn it as the first thing to get started with hacking and network and security.

575
0:23:08,760 --> 0:23:09,760
 Transport layer.

576
0:23:09,760 --> 0:23:11,100
 Transmission control protocol.

577
0:23:11,100 --> 0:23:12,100
 TCP UDP.

578
0:23:12,100 --> 0:23:16,240
 You need to know a little bit about that because that's some of the core protocols.

579
0:23:16,240 --> 0:23:20,040
 Like HTTP using TCP, DNS uses UDP.

580
0:23:20,040 --> 0:23:23,200
 So you need to know at least a little bit about TCP and UDP.

581
0:23:23,200 --> 0:23:28,980
 And then there's a common upper layer protocols like dynamic host configuration protocol DHCP.

582
0:23:28,980 --> 0:23:32,600
 You need to know how to set up a small lab network so you can test out things.

583
0:23:32,600 --> 0:23:35,320
 DNS, of course, with the domain names.

584
0:23:35,320 --> 0:23:40,860
 But you also need HTTP and HTTPS because everything is running HTTPS today.

585
0:23:40,860 --> 0:23:41,860
 And many people in Denmark.

586
0:23:41,860 --> 0:23:45,140
 They are actually configuring HTTPS in a bad way.

587
0:23:45,140 --> 0:23:48,140
 So that's one of the most common findings in our reports.

588
0:23:48,140 --> 0:23:53,540
 People are using bad and insecure protocols.

589
0:23:53,540 --> 0:23:55,820
 Just using DNS as an example.

590
0:23:55,820 --> 0:24:00,360
 If you just look into that protocol, you can actually make an impact for your organization.

591
0:24:00,360 --> 0:24:07,760
 So that's just a single area of this where you can actually start to get useful quickly.

592
0:24:07,760 --> 0:24:11,000
 I like to learn new concepts from books.

593
0:24:11,000 --> 0:24:13,020
 There's lots of resources.

594
0:24:13,020 --> 0:24:18,060
 You can probably mention podcasts, YouTube videos, profiles on the internet, blog posts.

595
0:24:18,060 --> 0:24:22,960
 Blog posts are not as common anymore, but there's lots of resources on the internet.

596
0:24:22,960 --> 0:24:27,680
 They are great for a single subject if you know the area already.

597
0:24:27,680 --> 0:24:32,260
 But if you want to learn a new area, I highly recommend books.

598
0:24:32,260 --> 0:24:37,280
 And books can be found often freely, legally also.

599
0:24:37,280 --> 0:24:38,280
 The book at the bottom is a web application security book by Andrew Hoffman.

600
0:24:38,280 --> 0:24:39,280
 It's very useful.

601
0:24:39,280 --> 0:24:40,280
 It's a very useful book.

602
0:24:40,280 --> 0:24:40,320
 It's a very useful book.

603
0:24:40,320 --> 0:24:40,360
 It's a very useful book.

604
0:24:40,360 --> 0:24:40,800
 It's a very useful book.

605
0:24:40,800 --> 0:24:40,820
 It's a very useful book.

606
0:24:40,820 --> 0:24:40,880
 It's a very useful book.

607
0:24:40,880 --> 0:24:40,980
 It's a very useful book.

608
0:24:40,980 --> 0:24:44,040
 It's available for free from nginx.com.

609
0:24:44,040 --> 0:24:49,020
 If you give them an email address and a few items of information, and you can unsubscribe

610
0:24:49,020 --> 0:24:53,260
 to the newsletter, and they actually do unsubscribe you from the newsletter and don't think they

611
0:24:53,260 --> 0:24:58,060
 sell off the information, but you can get a book for free about web application security.

612
0:24:58,700 --> 0:25:02,520
 And the thing I like about books is that they typically have some kind of clear structure.

613
0:25:02,660 --> 0:25:03,380
 They have an editor.

614
0:25:03,880 --> 0:25:07,180
 They probably go from some level onto some other level.

615
0:25:07,300 --> 0:25:10,780
 So they go from kind of a basic level to some kind of complete level.

616
0:25:10,780 --> 0:25:11,460
 So they go from kind of a basic level to some kind of complete goal.

617
0:25:12,180 --> 0:25:14,280
 And often they will have exercises available.

618
0:25:14,740 --> 0:25:21,380
 Some of the books that I recommend also have things you can download, lab content, packet

619
0:25:21,380 --> 0:25:23,160
 dumps for networking and so on.

620
0:25:23,400 --> 0:25:28,100
 So it's quite easy to get like an introduction into an area at least.

621
0:25:28,560 --> 0:25:34,480
 And in the old days, books were like 400 plus, but I'm seeing lots of books that are only

622
0:25:34,480 --> 0:25:38,400
 like 200, 250, 300 pages now.

623
0:25:38,400 --> 0:25:40,720
 And it actually gives me a lot of satisfaction.

624
0:25:40,780 --> 0:25:45,460
 And some of my students have told me it gives them satisfaction to actually read a book

625
0:25:45,460 --> 0:25:46,360
 from cover to cover.

626
0:25:46,820 --> 0:25:53,320
 So we use this web application security in a web security for web developers course in

627
0:25:53,320 --> 0:25:56,080
 Copenhagen, and we read the whole book.

628
0:25:56,660 --> 0:25:59,020
 It was short enough that we could read the whole book.

629
0:25:59,660 --> 0:26:02,720
 You can also go to my courses and exercise booklets.

630
0:26:02,800 --> 0:26:06,320
 I don't have an editor, so they won't be as great as some of these books.

631
0:26:06,320 --> 0:26:10,100
 So getting a book is my recommendation for learning some of these things.

632
0:26:10,780 --> 0:26:17,660
 Then when you know these basic protocols, you have perhaps read one of these books,

633
0:26:17,660 --> 0:26:23,400
 you can then dive into a part of the area, you can start to go in different directions,

634
0:26:23,580 --> 0:26:28,020
 you will have the basic level that will enable you to explore on your own.

635
0:26:28,380 --> 0:26:33,840
 And that's actually what you want to do at a later stage because you want to learn something

636
0:26:33,840 --> 0:26:38,660
 specific, you probably got interested in some specific attack, some specific area.

637
0:26:38,940 --> 0:26:40,740
 And I think now you are ready.

638
0:26:40,780 --> 0:26:43,080
 You are ready to dig deeper into those parts.

639
0:26:43,540 --> 0:26:49,940
 For me, it's typically packets and packet analysis, capturing packets, port mirroring,

640
0:26:50,200 --> 0:26:52,200
 trying to work with network traffic.

641
0:26:52,400 --> 0:26:55,100
 And that's some of the things that we can do on camps like this.

642
0:26:55,380 --> 0:26:58,580
 We can just set up a machine, see that we're getting scanned.

643
0:26:58,620 --> 0:27:02,460
 And immediately after we got online, we actually got scanned in this network.

644
0:27:02,720 --> 0:27:07,700
 So your machine on this network, if you're running a public IP address on the Bornhack SSID,

645
0:27:07,880 --> 0:27:09,820
 you will get network attacks.

646
0:27:10,260 --> 0:27:10,740
 And that's something that we can do.

647
0:27:10,940 --> 0:27:13,080
 That's something you can work on in this network.

648
0:27:13,280 --> 0:27:15,440
 And you can actually also do that at home.

649
0:27:15,640 --> 0:27:20,940
 Maybe a little bit difficult if you have a very bad small CPE router from an internet provider.

650
0:27:26,940 --> 0:27:35,260
 Also, you should, in your learning materials, make sure that you cover different formats.

651
0:27:35,460 --> 0:27:40,340
 Because when I grew up, it was very common to have these ASCII text files, and it was

652
0:27:40,340 --> 0:27:45,140
 very common to have these academic papers, which are kind of in two columns and a big

653
0:27:45,140 --> 0:27:47,100
 abstract at the start.

654
0:27:47,500 --> 0:27:51,840
 And you should force yourself to be able to read these different formats.

655
0:27:51,840 --> 0:27:55,820
 So make sure that you include different formats, different resources.

656
0:27:56,180 --> 0:28:02,120
 And as you get to know different sources, you will recognize names, programs, peoples,

657
0:28:02,120 --> 0:28:06,920
 authors, sites, and some sites will be specialized in different areas.

658
0:28:07,100 --> 0:28:09,060
 So I kind of make a mental note.

659
0:28:09,260 --> 0:28:09,860
 So if this site is a good place to start, then you can do it.

660
0:28:09,860 --> 0:28:10,000
 So if you're looking for a good site, then you can do it.

661
0:28:10,000 --> 0:28:10,100
 So if you're looking for a good site, then you can do it.

662
0:28:10,100 --> 0:28:10,320
 So if you're looking for a good site, then you can do it.

663
0:28:10,340 --> 0:28:16,580
 If a spaffled person writes something new, I put it on a to-read list, and it's a professor

664
0:28:16,580 --> 0:28:19,480
 who wrote some of the old internet security text.

665
0:28:19,780 --> 0:28:24,760
 So if he writes something, I will definitely try to read it, because it's typically something

666
0:28:24,760 --> 0:28:26,260
 that has good content.

667
0:28:26,780 --> 0:28:31,900
 So I force my students to read old hacker text files, computer science papers, but there's

668
0:28:31,900 --> 0:28:37,280
 web articles, blog posts, books, chapters, standout documents, internet requests for

669
0:28:37,280 --> 0:28:40,280
 comments are the defining documents.

670
0:28:40,280 --> 0:28:42,060
 about the protocols that we use.

671
0:28:42,480 --> 0:28:45,300
 So you should at least be able to read the table of contents.

672
0:28:45,580 --> 0:28:46,720
 You should know it exists.

673
0:28:47,080 --> 0:28:49,200
 There is one that documents TLS 1.2.

674
0:28:49,480 --> 0:28:50,860
 It's horrible to read.

675
0:28:51,160 --> 0:28:52,960
 I don't force my students to read all of it,

676
0:28:53,180 --> 0:28:55,940
 but they should at least know that this is where it originates.

677
0:28:56,160 --> 0:28:57,300
 This is where it comes from.

678
0:29:00,300 --> 0:29:06,900
 I have a little bit of very, very stubborn, what do you call it,

679
0:29:06,900 --> 0:29:10,480
 focus on some things that I force my students to use.

680
0:29:11,120 --> 0:29:16,480
 I guess most people are getting exposed to Windows along their childhood,

681
0:29:17,160 --> 0:29:21,180
 forcing people and children to run Windows or Mac.

682
0:29:21,540 --> 0:29:24,400
 Some of these things are getting used by people, tablets and so on.

683
0:29:24,400 --> 0:29:27,300
 But I also really love open source.

684
0:29:27,760 --> 0:29:30,260
 So I force my students to learn open source

685
0:29:30,260 --> 0:29:32,960
 because there's just so much great open source

686
0:29:32,960 --> 0:29:36,280
 that ignoring it will make your life,

687
0:29:36,280 --> 0:29:37,580
 worse.

688
0:29:38,240 --> 0:29:40,100
 You can actually make your life so much better

689
0:29:40,100 --> 0:29:42,600
 by using open source, knowing it exists,

690
0:29:42,940 --> 0:29:46,380
 and you can probably solve 90 plus percent of your task

691
0:29:46,380 --> 0:29:48,440
 by using existing open source.

692
0:29:48,760 --> 0:29:51,920
 So I force people to use open source.

693
0:29:52,220 --> 0:29:54,080
 And then the next point is Linux Unix.

694
0:29:54,360 --> 0:29:57,320
 And I find that Unix Linux knowledge is necessary.

695
0:29:58,040 --> 0:30:00,020
 It is something that I force my students to do.

696
0:30:00,360 --> 0:30:04,380
 They cannot really pass my courses without having a virtual machine.

697
0:30:04,380 --> 0:30:06,200
 We don't have to do complex.

698
0:30:06,280 --> 0:30:08,280
 We don't have to do complex stuff with this Linux.

699
0:30:08,280 --> 0:30:10,280
 But we need to be able to boot it up, shut it down,

700
0:30:10,280 --> 0:30:12,280
 boot it up, run Nmap, shut it down.

701
0:30:12,280 --> 0:30:14,280
 That is something that you must be able to do

702
0:30:14,280 --> 0:30:20,280
 because a lot of the newest tools are written for Linux, Unix, and BSD.

703
0:30:20,280 --> 0:30:24,280
 So without having this knowledge, at least a little bit of knowledge,

704
0:30:24,280 --> 0:30:28,280
 you will be restricted in what you can actually do.

705
0:30:28,280 --> 0:30:32,280
 Talking about open source, I also point people to Git and GitHub.

706
0:30:32,280 --> 0:30:36,280
 Again, we can discuss if those are the best resources where you can find everything.

707
0:30:36,280 --> 0:30:38,280
 It is not.

708
0:30:38,280 --> 0:30:42,280
 But it is one of the easiest ways to find a lot of popular products.

709
0:30:42,280 --> 0:30:46,280
 So you can actually go to GitHub, search for something like port scanning, Nmap.

710
0:30:46,280 --> 0:30:48,280
 You can find analyzers.

711
0:30:48,280 --> 0:30:50,280
 You can find report writing tools for Nmap.

712
0:30:50,280 --> 0:30:52,280
 You can find lots of things with a few keywords.

713
0:30:52,280 --> 0:30:54,280
 So tools and libraries and applications.

714
0:30:54,280 --> 0:30:58,280
 You can find complete applications that often do what you want to do.

715
0:30:58,280 --> 0:31:02,280
 Then you need a little bit of what I call programming experience.

716
0:31:02,280 --> 0:31:04,280
 It is typically for automating stuff.

717
0:31:04,280 --> 0:31:06,280
 I am not a great programmer.

718
0:31:06,280 --> 0:31:08,280
 At all.

719
0:31:08,280 --> 0:31:10,280
 But I know how to connect a few things.

720
0:31:10,280 --> 0:31:14,280
 I know that there is something called XML that can be outputted from a tool.

721
0:31:14,280 --> 0:31:16,280
 And then you can convert it into something called JSON.

722
0:31:16,280 --> 0:31:20,280
 And then you can convert something like JSON into something called SVG,

723
0:31:20,280 --> 0:31:22,280
 which can be displayed in a browser.

724
0:31:22,280 --> 0:31:24,280
 There is a lot of things going on.

725
0:31:24,280 --> 0:31:28,280
 And if you know that there is a tool that can do SVG,

726
0:31:28,280 --> 0:31:30,280
 and there is a tool that can do XML,

727
0:31:30,280 --> 0:31:34,280
 you can actually perhaps go directly to SVG from XML.

728
0:31:34,280 --> 0:31:36,280
 And Nmap can output in XML.

729
0:31:36,280 --> 0:31:38,280
 Process that into HTML.

730
0:31:38,280 --> 0:31:40,280
 And there is actually already,

731
0:31:40,280 --> 0:31:42,280
 what is that called?

732
0:31:42,280 --> 0:31:44,280
 Not CSS, but the other one.

733
0:31:44,280 --> 0:31:46,280
 XSSLT.

734
0:31:46,280 --> 0:31:48,280
 Yeah, I cannot say it even.

735
0:31:48,280 --> 0:31:50,280
 XSLT.

736
0:31:50,280 --> 0:31:52,280
 So you can actually convert XML files from Nmap into HTML files,

737
0:31:52,280 --> 0:31:54,280
 which you can more or less copy into a Word document.

738
0:31:54,280 --> 0:31:58,280
 And then you are halfway to writing a small report for your organization.

739
0:31:58,280 --> 0:32:02,280
 Also, there are a few things that I really love.

740
0:32:02,280 --> 0:32:04,280
 Ansible provisioning for installing and configuring software.

741
0:32:04,280 --> 0:32:06,280
 Because as security people,

742
0:32:06,280 --> 0:32:08,280
 we also need to run servers,

743
0:32:08,280 --> 0:32:10,280
 a little bit of servers.

744
0:32:10,280 --> 0:32:12,280
 We need to be able to do it by ourselves.

745
0:32:12,280 --> 0:32:14,280
 If we have to ask server people to provide a server,

746
0:32:14,280 --> 0:32:16,280
 set it up for us,

747
0:32:16,280 --> 0:32:18,280
 install a small tool from GitHub,

748
0:32:18,280 --> 0:32:20,280
 it is just easier if we can do it by ourselves.

749
0:32:20,280 --> 0:32:22,280
 One of the tools that I also recommend a lot,

750
0:32:22,280 --> 0:32:24,280
 and I am not affiliated with Elasticsearch,

751
0:32:24,280 --> 0:32:26,280
 and I find the licensing is very much too expensive,

752
0:32:26,280 --> 0:32:28,280
 at least for Danish companies.

753
0:32:28,280 --> 0:32:30,280
 I think the API is a little bit too expensive.

754
0:32:30,280 --> 0:32:32,280
 I think the API is a little bit too expensive,

755
0:32:32,280 --> 0:32:34,280
 at least for Danish companies.

756
0:32:34,280 --> 0:32:36,280
 The entry level is something like 15,000 euros

757
0:32:36,280 --> 0:32:38,280
 The entry level is something like 15,000 euros

758
0:32:38,280 --> 0:32:40,280
 for a smallest production cluster.

759
0:32:40,280 --> 0:32:42,280
 But you can use Elasticsearch for free,

760
0:32:42,280 --> 0:32:44,280
 and it is kind of a nice service,

761
0:32:44,280 --> 0:32:46,280
 because you can cover a lot of ground with Elasticsearch.

762
0:32:46,280 --> 0:32:48,280
 because you can cover a lot of ground with Elasticsearch.

763
0:32:48,280 --> 0:32:50,280
 They have a lot of focus on security,

764
0:32:50,280 --> 0:32:52,280
 so by using this tool,

765
0:32:52,280 --> 0:32:54,280
 I can actually, from a lot of my tools,

766
0:32:54,280 --> 0:32:56,280
 integrate a lot of sources into this.

767
0:32:56,280 --> 0:32:58,280
 Which is also some of the tools that I recommend and use,

768
0:32:58,280 --> 0:33:00,280
 are tools that can be used for multiple purposes.

769
0:33:00,280 --> 0:33:02,280
 are tools that can be used for multiple purposes.

770
0:33:02,280 --> 0:33:04,280
 And that's very nice,

771
0:33:04,280 --> 0:33:06,280
 that you can use Elasticsearch as the backend

772
0:33:06,280 --> 0:33:08,280
 for receiving a lot of data,

773
0:33:08,280 --> 0:33:10,280
 and then you can actually work with that

774
0:33:10,280 --> 0:33:12,280
 using a GUI called Kibana on top of Elasticsearch,

775
0:33:12,280 --> 0:33:14,280
 running in a browser,

776
0:33:14,280 --> 0:33:16,280
 and they have a lot of sample data also.

777
0:33:18,280 --> 0:33:20,280
 One of the things that I highly recommend

778
0:33:20,280 --> 0:33:22,280
 is doing a hacker lab,

779
0:33:22,280 --> 0:33:24,280
 and you can start creating that on your laptop today,

780
0:33:24,280 --> 0:33:26,280
 because most of you will have a laptop

781
0:33:26,280 --> 0:33:28,280
 that can run virtualization,

782
0:33:28,280 --> 0:33:30,280
 you can run Docker,

783
0:33:30,280 --> 0:33:32,280
 you can run a virtualized tool,

784
0:33:32,280 --> 0:33:34,280
 VMware Player,

785
0:33:34,280 --> 0:33:36,280
 Sen, Hypervisor,

786
0:33:36,280 --> 0:33:38,280
 KVM on Linux,

787
0:33:38,280 --> 0:33:40,280
 you can run...

788
0:33:40,280 --> 0:33:42,280
 I'm missing one...

789
0:33:42,280 --> 0:33:44,280
 Hyper-V on Windows, thank you for that,

790
0:33:44,280 --> 0:33:46,280
 because that's definitely a nice way

791
0:33:46,280 --> 0:33:48,280
 of doing that,

792
0:33:48,280 --> 0:33:50,280
 and so most of you will have the opportunity

793
0:33:50,280 --> 0:33:52,280
 to run some kind of virtualized machine,

794
0:33:52,280 --> 0:33:54,280
 and you can get actual

795
0:33:54,280 --> 0:33:56,280
 experience using the tools.

796
0:33:56,280 --> 0:33:58,280
 And that will make it much easier to apply

797
0:33:58,280 --> 0:34:00,280
 in a real-life situation, of course,

798
0:34:00,280 --> 0:34:02,280
 you have tried it before.

799
0:34:02,280 --> 0:34:04,280
 Looking at especially Debian and Kali Linux

800
0:34:04,280 --> 0:34:06,280
 are the ones that I propose

801
0:34:06,280 --> 0:34:08,280
 that you look into,

802
0:34:08,280 --> 0:34:10,280
 and that's because they have a lot of good documentation,

803
0:34:10,280 --> 0:34:12,280
 they have existed for so many years.

804
0:34:12,280 --> 0:34:14,280
 There's a Debian handbook,

805
0:34:14,280 --> 0:34:16,280
 and the Kali Linux Revealed,

806
0:34:16,280 --> 0:34:18,280
 which are free PDFs that will walk you through

807
0:34:18,280 --> 0:34:20,280
 any part of the installing

808
0:34:20,280 --> 0:34:22,280
 and running a Debian server,

809
0:34:22,280 --> 0:34:24,280
 which is a virtual machine,

810
0:34:24,280 --> 0:34:26,280
 and then a Debian, which is a Kali Linux,

811
0:34:26,280 --> 0:34:28,280
 because it's built on top of Debian,

812
0:34:28,280 --> 0:34:30,280
 so they will be very similar, again,

813
0:34:30,280 --> 0:34:32,280
 to update both of them,

814
0:34:32,280 --> 0:34:34,280
 but it's coming from different repositories.

815
0:34:34,280 --> 0:34:36,280
 They will be described in these complete books

816
0:34:36,280 --> 0:34:38,280
 about the operating systems.

817
0:34:38,280 --> 0:34:40,280
 So they are different operating systems,

818
0:34:40,280 --> 0:34:42,280
 both based on Debian,

819
0:34:42,280 --> 0:34:44,280
 and the Kali Linux actually has more than

820
0:34:44,280 --> 0:34:46,280
 300 tools pre-installed,

821
0:34:46,280 --> 0:34:48,280
 so that's quite nice.

822
0:34:48,280 --> 0:34:50,280
 You don't need to learn how to install a tool

823
0:34:50,280 --> 0:34:52,280
 before you can start using it.

824
0:34:52,280 --> 0:34:54,280
 I think it's a must for working

825
0:34:54,280 --> 0:34:56,280
 in network and security,

826
0:34:56,280 --> 0:34:58,280
 and I'm luckily not the only one saying that,

827
0:34:58,280 --> 0:35:00,280
 so you will find lots of

828
0:35:00,280 --> 0:35:02,280
 more important people than me

829
0:35:02,280 --> 0:35:04,280
 saying that this is a requirement

830
0:35:04,280 --> 0:35:06,280
 for running network and security things.

831
0:35:06,280 --> 0:35:08,280
 Or you can go the other way

832
0:35:08,280 --> 0:35:10,280
 and be an expert in Excel,

833
0:35:10,280 --> 0:35:12,280
 and then you can take on a lot of these tasks

834
0:35:12,280 --> 0:35:14,280
 for people working in network and security.

835
0:35:14,280 --> 0:35:16,280
 That's also fine.

836
0:35:16,280 --> 0:35:18,280
 I just want to point you

837
0:35:18,280 --> 0:35:20,280
 to some of the resources that I have used.

838
0:35:20,280 --> 0:35:22,280
 So in this presentation,

839
0:35:22,280 --> 0:35:24,280
 there will be resources that I have used

840
0:35:24,280 --> 0:35:26,280
 and are using.

841
0:35:26,280 --> 0:35:28,280
 Open source Python is one of the languages

842
0:35:28,280 --> 0:35:30,280
 that I recommend, because most of the tools

843
0:35:30,280 --> 0:35:32,280
 are Python version,

844
0:35:32,280 --> 0:35:34,280
 and it may exist in other tools,

845
0:35:34,280 --> 0:35:36,280
 also including C-Sharp and PowerScript.

846
0:35:36,280 --> 0:35:38,280
 Is that the name?

847
0:35:38,280 --> 0:35:40,280
 PowerShell, sorry.

848
0:35:40,280 --> 0:35:42,280
 I could hear that it was wrong.

849
0:35:42,280 --> 0:35:44,280
 PowerShell and other languages.

850
0:35:44,280 --> 0:35:46,280
 But there's always a Python version.

851
0:35:46,280 --> 0:35:48,280
 There's always a Python library.

852
0:35:48,280 --> 0:35:50,280
 So Python is one of the tools

853
0:35:50,280 --> 0:35:52,280
 that I would recommend

854
0:35:52,280 --> 0:35:54,280
 that you look into.

855
0:35:54,280 --> 0:35:56,280
 And then you can find tools like Maltrail,

856
0:35:56,280 --> 0:35:58,280
 which can actually look at bad traffic

857
0:35:58,280 --> 0:36:00,280
 and immediately start creating data

858
0:36:00,280 --> 0:36:02,280
 from dashboards and stuff.

859
0:36:02,280 --> 0:36:04,280
 So that's, again, one of the tools

860
0:36:04,280 --> 0:36:06,280
 that I have used.

861
0:36:06,280 --> 0:36:08,280
 And just by turning it on,

862
0:36:08,280 --> 0:36:10,280
 I'm getting nice knowledge from the network

863
0:36:10,280 --> 0:36:12,280
 about people that were infected with macrovirus

864
0:36:12,280 --> 0:36:14,280
 and contacting bad servers on the internet.

865
0:36:14,280 --> 0:36:16,280
 Also, this tool Ansible,

866
0:36:16,280 --> 0:36:18,280
 I'm just going to point to Ansible

867
0:36:18,280 --> 0:36:20,280
 because I think it's quite easy

868
0:36:20,280 --> 0:36:22,280
 to get started in Ansible.

869
0:36:22,280 --> 0:36:24,280
 But also Ansible has a very broad target.

870
0:36:24,280 --> 0:36:26,280
 You can target platforms

871
0:36:26,280 --> 0:36:28,280
 such as network devices.

872
0:36:28,280 --> 0:36:30,280
 So this is a long list

873
0:36:30,280 --> 0:36:32,280
 of network devices

874
0:36:32,280 --> 0:36:34,280
 which are probably among the ones

875
0:36:34,280 --> 0:36:36,280
 that are being used in Denmark

876
0:36:36,280 --> 0:36:38,280
 and other places.

877
0:36:38,280 --> 0:36:40,280
 So it can be used for network equipment

878
0:36:40,280 --> 0:36:42,280
 and it can also be used for hosts and servers,

879
0:36:42,280 --> 0:36:44,280
 application servers,

880
0:36:44,280 --> 0:36:46,280
 running Linux, OpenBSD, FreeBSD and so on.

881
0:36:46,280 --> 0:36:48,280
 There is Ansible support in Windows

882
0:36:48,280 --> 0:36:50,280
 but it's not complete

883
0:36:50,280 --> 0:36:52,280
 and probably you would rather use

884
0:36:52,280 --> 0:36:54,280
 other tools for Windows.

885
0:36:54,280 --> 0:36:56,280
 But for anything else, basically,

886
0:36:56,280 --> 0:36:58,280
 you can use Ansible.

887
0:36:58,280 --> 0:37:00,280
 So it's very generic.

888
0:37:00,280 --> 0:37:02,280
 It can quickly lead you into Git.

889
0:37:02,280 --> 0:37:04,280
 So again, Git is a prerequisite

890
0:37:04,280 --> 0:37:06,280
 for working in network and security.

891
0:37:06,280 --> 0:37:08,280
 Elasticsearch

892
0:37:08,280 --> 0:37:10,280
 is the one that I talked about

893
0:37:10,280 --> 0:37:12,280
 which has different,

894
0:37:12,280 --> 0:37:14,280
 you could call them sub-applications,

895
0:37:14,280 --> 0:37:16,280
 applications that feed Elasticsearch with data.

896
0:37:16,280 --> 0:37:18,280
 So there's different parts

897
0:37:18,280 --> 0:37:20,280
 of this ecosystem

898
0:37:20,280 --> 0:37:22,280
 and they typically don't call it

899
0:37:22,280 --> 0:37:24,280
 the ELK stack anymore.

900
0:37:24,280 --> 0:37:26,280
 It used to be the ELK stack for Elasticsearch,

901
0:37:26,280 --> 0:37:28,280
 Logstash and Kibana.

902
0:37:28,280 --> 0:37:30,280
 But there's so many tools and components

903
0:37:30,280 --> 0:37:32,280
 in this stack of tools

904
0:37:32,280 --> 0:37:34,280
 so they typically call it

905
0:37:34,280 --> 0:37:36,280
 the Elastic stack today.

906
0:37:36,280 --> 0:37:38,280
 And I enjoy this

907
0:37:40,280 --> 0:37:42,280
 technology because they have done

908
0:37:42,280 --> 0:37:44,280
 what is called an elastic common schema

909
0:37:44,280 --> 0:37:46,280
 which are field definitions

910
0:37:46,280 --> 0:37:48,280
 for stuff like an IP address.

911
0:37:48,280 --> 0:37:50,280
 So if you're using and adhering to this

912
0:37:50,280 --> 0:37:52,280
 standard in a tool,

913
0:37:52,280 --> 0:37:54,280
 you can mix and match with other tools.

914
0:37:54,280 --> 0:37:56,280
 So like the dream would be that you could take

915
0:37:56,280 --> 0:37:58,280
 firewall locks from a Juniper device

916
0:37:58,280 --> 0:38:00,280
 or a Cisco device,

917
0:38:00,280 --> 0:38:02,280
 they end up in the same field in the database,

918
0:38:02,280 --> 0:38:04,280
 the document store that they call it.

919
0:38:04,280 --> 0:38:06,280
 Then you can actually do a dashboard

920
0:38:06,280 --> 0:38:08,280
 that will cover two different

921
0:38:08,280 --> 0:38:10,280
 network technologies in your network.

922
0:38:10,280 --> 0:38:12,280
 So this is one of the things

923
0:38:12,280 --> 0:38:14,280
 that I enjoy by using Elastic.

924
0:38:14,280 --> 0:38:16,280
 So this is hereby

925
0:38:16,280 --> 0:38:18,280
 passed on to you.

926
0:38:18,280 --> 0:38:20,280
 And there's also complete applications

927
0:38:20,280 --> 0:38:22,280
 available. The one called ElastiFlow

928
0:38:22,280 --> 0:38:24,280
 is just a single line in this.

929
0:38:24,280 --> 0:38:26,280
 But if you know how to boot a Linux

930
0:38:26,280 --> 0:38:28,280
 machine, git clone

931
0:38:28,280 --> 0:38:30,280
 a repository,

932
0:38:30,280 --> 0:38:32,280
 you actually get a complete

933
0:38:32,280 --> 0:38:34,280
 dashboard with network flows

934
0:38:34,280 --> 0:38:36,280
 in your whole network.

935
0:38:36,280 --> 0:38:38,280
 So if we were

936
0:38:38,280 --> 0:38:40,280
 monitoring the network using NetFlow

937
0:38:40,280 --> 0:38:42,280
 in this network, which we are definitely

938
0:38:42,280 --> 0:38:44,280
 not, we would actually be able to see

939
0:38:44,280 --> 0:38:46,280
 every IP inside the network

940
0:38:46,280 --> 0:38:48,280
 contacting servers on the internet,

941
0:38:48,280 --> 0:38:50,280
 servers on the internet connecting to us,

942
0:38:50,280 --> 0:38:52,280
 seeing who uses the most bandwidth,

943
0:38:52,280 --> 0:38:54,280
 what protocols and stuff. And that's a complete

944
0:38:54,280 --> 0:38:56,280
 application you could install

945
0:38:56,280 --> 0:38:58,280
 by just knowing a little bit of

946
0:38:58,280 --> 0:39:00,280
 Linux and command line

947
0:39:00,280 --> 0:39:02,280
 git.

948
0:39:04,280 --> 0:39:06,280
 I will just keep on talking

949
0:39:06,280 --> 0:39:08,280
 until they pull me down from this stage.

950
0:39:08,280 --> 0:39:10,280
 So I will now again

951
0:39:10,280 --> 0:39:12,280
 drop back a little bit

952
0:39:12,280 --> 0:39:14,280
 and try to make it more structured

953
0:39:14,280 --> 0:39:16,280
 so when you get back and read this slideshow perhaps

954
0:39:16,280 --> 0:39:18,280
 you can decide

955
0:39:18,280 --> 0:39:20,280
 what to do and where to start.

956
0:39:20,280 --> 0:39:22,280
 I'm going to take

957
0:39:24,280 --> 0:39:26,280
 as an initial starting

958
0:39:26,280 --> 0:39:28,280
 point, we have this called the

959
0:39:28,280 --> 0:39:30,280
 diploma in IT security in Denmark.

960
0:39:30,280 --> 0:39:32,280
 Which is a

961
0:39:32,280 --> 0:39:34,280
 government certified

962
0:39:34,280 --> 0:39:36,280
 acknowledged

963
0:39:36,280 --> 0:39:38,280
 education diploma in IT security

964
0:39:38,280 --> 0:39:40,280
 which is based on

965
0:39:40,280 --> 0:39:42,280
 different courses.

966
0:39:42,280 --> 0:39:44,280
 So this is a list of the courses

967
0:39:44,280 --> 0:39:46,280
 that are needed to get this diploma.

968
0:39:46,280 --> 0:39:48,280
 It's not to say that all of you should

969
0:39:48,280 --> 0:39:50,280
 take this, but you can use it

970
0:39:50,280 --> 0:39:52,280
 again for guiding your

971
0:39:52,280 --> 0:39:54,280
 path into network

972
0:39:54,280 --> 0:39:56,280
 and security.

973
0:39:56,280 --> 0:39:58,280
 So it will have something, sorry this is

974
0:39:58,280 --> 0:40:00,280
 in Danish, but this one says

975
0:40:00,280 --> 0:40:02,280
 governance. So governance is a large

976
0:40:02,280 --> 0:40:04,280
 part of security. There's something about

977
0:40:04,280 --> 0:40:06,280
 system security, servers

978
0:40:06,280 --> 0:40:08,280
 and all of that. Authentication

979
0:40:08,280 --> 0:40:10,280
 is a large part of security.

980
0:40:10,280 --> 0:40:12,280
 There's also software security because

981
0:40:12,280 --> 0:40:14,280
 software is quite important for security.

982
0:40:14,280 --> 0:40:16,280
 There's also network and

983
0:40:16,280 --> 0:40:18,280
 communication security which

984
0:40:18,280 --> 0:40:20,280
 is about IDS and packets and so on.

985
0:40:20,280 --> 0:40:22,280
 These courses

986
0:40:22,280 --> 0:40:24,280
 some of them are mandatory, some

987
0:40:24,280 --> 0:40:26,280
 of them are electives that you can take after

988
0:40:26,280 --> 0:40:28,280
 but you need to have at least 60

989
0:40:28,280 --> 0:40:30,280
 of these ECTS points.

990
0:40:30,280 --> 0:40:32,280
 And all of my educational

991
0:40:32,280 --> 0:40:34,280
 materials for all of the courses that I

992
0:40:34,280 --> 0:40:36,280
 teach is available on GitHub.

993
0:40:36,280 --> 0:40:38,280
 So you can just start out reading some of these

994
0:40:38,280 --> 0:40:40,280
 and the lecture plans

995
0:40:40,280 --> 0:40:42,280
 could be used at home

996
0:40:42,280 --> 0:40:44,280
 to decide that you want to read this

997
0:40:44,280 --> 0:40:46,280
 chapter and try to do these exercises,

998
0:40:46,280 --> 0:40:48,280
 read the next chapters and do the

999
0:40:48,280 --> 0:40:50,280
 next exercises. My

1000
0:40:50,280 --> 0:40:52,280
 exercise booklets are quite easy

1001
0:40:52,280 --> 0:40:54,280
 to follow I think and use some of

1002
0:40:54,280 --> 0:40:56,280
 these tools that I have mentioned already.

1003
0:40:56,280 --> 0:40:58,280
 One of them is the

1004
0:40:58,280 --> 0:41:00,280
 communications and network security course.

1005
0:41:00,280 --> 0:41:02,280
 Where I have selected some of the

1006
0:41:02,280 --> 0:41:04,280
 books that I prefer for this area.

1007
0:41:06,280 --> 0:41:08,280
 I know that I jump a little bit around

1008
0:41:08,280 --> 0:41:10,280
 in these slides but this one called

1009
0:41:10,280 --> 0:41:12,280
 Linux basics for hackers getting started

1010
0:41:12,280 --> 0:41:14,280
 with networking scripting and security in Kali.

1011
0:41:14,280 --> 0:41:16,280
 It sounds almost

1012
0:41:16,280 --> 0:41:18,280
 as the title of this slideshow

1013
0:41:18,280 --> 0:41:20,280
 and it is actually a book

1014
0:41:20,280 --> 0:41:22,280
 248 pages

1015
0:41:22,280 --> 0:41:24,280
 describes how to get started on

1016
0:41:24,280 --> 0:41:26,280
 Linux. It's actually not a

1017
0:41:26,280 --> 0:41:28,280
 security book or a hacking book

1018
0:41:28,280 --> 0:41:30,280
 it's a book about Kali Linux and it

1019
0:41:30,280 --> 0:41:32,280
 will explain stuff like the file

1020
0:41:32,280 --> 0:41:34,280
 system. Something like

1021
0:41:34,280 --> 0:41:36,280
 running on the command line using

1022
0:41:36,280 --> 0:41:38,280
 grep for searching through text files

1023
0:41:38,280 --> 0:41:40,280
 doing some basic

1024
0:41:40,280 --> 0:41:42,280
 scripting. How do you

1025
0:41:42,280 --> 0:41:44,280
 make a small script that can be run on

1026
0:41:44,280 --> 0:41:46,280
 a Linux. So it's 248

1027
0:41:46,280 --> 0:41:48,280
 pages and it's one that I

1028
0:41:48,280 --> 0:41:50,280
 again force my students to read

1029
0:41:50,280 --> 0:41:52,280
 and by using that resource along

1030
0:41:52,280 --> 0:41:54,280
 with the virtual machine they get confident

1031
0:41:54,280 --> 0:41:56,280
 enough that they can run the tools

1032
0:41:56,280 --> 0:41:58,280
 when they get home in their own organizations.

1033
0:41:58,280 --> 0:42:00,280
 So that's actually a proven

1034
0:42:00,280 --> 0:42:02,280
 they can use this tool with

1035
0:42:02,280 --> 0:42:04,280
 Linux. We also

1036
0:42:04,280 --> 0:42:06,280
 have practical packet analysis which is from

1037
0:42:06,280 --> 0:42:08,280
 NoStarch. I really enjoy that publisher

1038
0:42:08,280 --> 0:42:10,280
 because it's very practical books

1039
0:42:10,280 --> 0:42:12,280
 this is a dedicated

1040
0:42:12,280 --> 0:42:14,280
 book about packet analysis

1041
0:42:14,280 --> 0:42:16,280
 but it actually works through different scenarios

1042
0:42:16,280 --> 0:42:18,280
 you can download packet dumps

1043
0:42:18,280 --> 0:42:20,280
 you can start working on

1044
0:42:20,280 --> 0:42:22,280
 using an actual tool. In this

1045
0:42:22,280 --> 0:42:24,280
 case it's Wireshark which is one of the most

1046
0:42:24,280 --> 0:42:26,280
 common tools which is also something

1047
0:42:26,280 --> 0:42:28,280
 that I

1048
0:42:28,280 --> 0:42:30,280
 recommend that you look into

1049
0:42:30,280 --> 0:42:32,280
 just by starting Wireshark

1050
0:42:32,280 --> 0:42:34,280
 listening to an Ethernet on his camp

1051
0:42:34,280 --> 0:42:36,280
 you will see a lot of traffic and that can be fun

1052
0:42:36,280 --> 0:42:38,280
 in just looking at what happens in a network

1053
0:42:38,280 --> 0:42:40,280
 and a lot of

1054
0:42:40,280 --> 0:42:42,280
 devices will just broadcast their names

1055
0:42:42,280 --> 0:42:44,280
 and who they are and what

1056
0:42:44,280 --> 0:42:46,280
 versions and actually the switches

1057
0:42:46,280 --> 0:42:48,280
 on this side they will tell you what

1058
0:42:48,280 --> 0:42:50,280
 Junos version they're running

1059
0:42:50,280 --> 0:42:52,280
 we're not running the latest but you will

1060
0:42:52,280 --> 0:42:54,280
 see some security problems immediately

1061
0:42:54,280 --> 0:42:56,280
 by looking at traffic.

1062
0:42:56,280 --> 0:42:58,280
 Then there's a link to a

1063
0:42:58,280 --> 0:43:00,280
 lecture plan for this course this

1064
0:43:00,280 --> 0:43:02,280
 specific course and there

1065
0:43:02,280 --> 0:43:04,280
 are also the presentations so this

1066
0:43:04,280 --> 0:43:06,280
 is kind of a package that you could use

1067
0:43:06,280 --> 0:43:08,280
 and go through communication and

1068
0:43:08,280 --> 0:43:10,280
 network security and I think

1069
0:43:10,280 --> 0:43:12,280
 after reading these resources

1070
0:43:12,280 --> 0:43:14,280
 or at least the chapters that I recommend

1071
0:43:14,280 --> 0:43:16,280
 would make it possible

1072
0:43:16,280 --> 0:43:18,280
 for you to do some actual work

1073
0:43:18,280 --> 0:43:20,280
 within network and security

1074
0:43:20,280 --> 0:43:22,280
 the books if you want to buy

1075
0:43:22,280 --> 0:43:24,280
 them in hard copy it's about

1076
0:43:24,280 --> 0:43:26,280
 a thousand Danish kroner it may

1077
0:43:26,280 --> 0:43:28,280
 be outside the budget that

1078
0:43:28,280 --> 0:43:30,280
 you may be interested in just

1079
0:43:30,280 --> 0:43:32,280
 browsing some of this some of

1080
0:43:32,280 --> 0:43:34,280
 the books can be found as

1081
0:43:34,280 --> 0:43:36,280
 you can find what you call them

1082
0:43:36,280 --> 0:43:38,280
 example chapters for downloads

1083
0:43:38,280 --> 0:43:40,280
 you can check before buying it

1084
0:43:40,280 --> 0:43:42,280
 but also going to some of these humble

1085
0:43:42,280 --> 0:43:44,280
 bundles which I highly recommend

1086
0:43:44,280 --> 0:43:46,280
 you can get some of these books for

1087
0:43:46,280 --> 0:43:48,280
 as low as $25 for

1088
0:43:48,280 --> 0:43:50,280
 15 books and just by

1089
0:43:50,280 --> 0:43:52,280
 subscribing to the humble bundle

1090
0:43:52,280 --> 0:43:54,280
 I have bought

1091
0:43:54,280 --> 0:43:56,280
 I think 30 bundles by now because

1092
0:43:56,280 --> 0:43:58,280
 I almost always buy the bundles

1093
0:43:58,280 --> 0:44:00,280
 because then later I can go back and see

1094
0:44:00,280 --> 0:44:02,280
 oh was there something about data science

1095
0:44:02,280 --> 0:44:04,280
 yes there was and was there something

1096
0:44:04,280 --> 0:44:06,280
 about network security and hacking yes

1097
0:44:06,280 --> 0:44:08,280
 there was do I need to learn python yes

1098
0:44:08,280 --> 0:44:10,280
 there was a python book there was

1099
0:44:10,280 --> 0:44:12,280
 actually a python bundle with 15 books

1100
0:44:12,280 --> 0:44:14,280
 so humble bundle is one of the places

1101
0:44:14,280 --> 0:44:16,280
 where you can get it for cheaper

1102
0:44:16,280 --> 0:44:18,280
 some of the other books that I recommend

1103
0:44:18,280 --> 0:44:20,280
 like the debian administrators handbook

1104
0:44:20,280 --> 0:44:22,280
 the Kali Linux revealed they will

1105
0:44:22,280 --> 0:44:24,280
 describe everything about running a

1106
0:44:24,280 --> 0:44:26,280
 server installing packages configuring

1107
0:44:26,280 --> 0:44:28,280
 the network what to expect when you

1108
0:44:28,280 --> 0:44:30,280
 boot up your

1109
0:44:30,280 --> 0:44:32,280
 there's also this book that I have

1110
0:44:32,280 --> 0:44:34,280
 recommended already the web application security

1111
0:44:34,280 --> 0:44:36,280
 and then there's one called gray hat hacking

1112
0:44:36,280 --> 0:44:38,280
 which is recommended because it has

1113
0:44:38,280 --> 0:44:40,280
 bite-sized chapters

1114
0:44:40,280 --> 0:44:42,280
 so if you want to work in different areas

1115
0:44:42,280 --> 0:44:44,280
 of security this gray hat

1116
0:44:44,280 --> 0:44:46,280
 hacking book has enough of an

1117
0:44:46,280 --> 0:44:48,280
 introduction into various areas

1118
0:44:48,280 --> 0:44:50,280
 that is a very highly

1119
0:44:50,280 --> 0:44:52,280
 recommended book and it's also in the fifth edition

1120
0:44:52,280 --> 0:44:54,280
 which probably speaks

1121
0:44:54,280 --> 0:44:56,280
 to its value they decided to

1122
0:44:56,280 --> 0:44:58,280
 upgrade it and release it upgrade it

1123
0:44:58,280 --> 0:45:00,280
 and release it upgrade and upgrade

1124
0:45:00,280 --> 0:45:02,280
 and release it so it's one of the books

1125
0:45:02,280 --> 0:45:04,280
 that I am very fond of during

1126
0:45:04,280 --> 0:45:06,280
 my work and my

1127
0:45:06,280 --> 0:45:08,280
 teaching

1128
0:45:08,280 --> 0:45:10,280
 you

1129
0:45:10,280 --> 0:45:12,280
 also probably want to invest a little

1130
0:45:12,280 --> 0:45:14,280
 bit in network equipment

1131
0:45:14,280 --> 0:45:16,280
 I use openbsd I use

1132
0:45:16,280 --> 0:45:18,280
 switches from juniper there's

1133
0:45:18,280 --> 0:45:20,280
 actually a small pile of switches

1134
0:45:20,280 --> 0:45:22,280
 at the end of camp near

1135
0:45:22,280 --> 0:45:24,280
 the garbage because we have some

1136
0:45:24,280 --> 0:45:26,280
 surplus switches that we're going to

1137
0:45:26,280 --> 0:45:28,280
 throw out and they are actually

1138
0:45:28,280 --> 0:45:30,280
 excellent for learning VLANs and

1139
0:45:30,280 --> 0:45:32,280
 stuff they can do some of this basic

1140
0:45:32,280 --> 0:45:34,280
 stuff they can run SNMP

1141
0:45:34,280 --> 0:45:36,280
 for management so

1142
0:45:36,280 --> 0:45:38,280
 probably get some switches some ethernet

1143
0:45:38,280 --> 0:45:40,280
 equipment and running in a

1144
0:45:40,280 --> 0:45:42,280
 small isolated network

1145
0:45:42,280 --> 0:45:44,280
 running these tools is probably recommended

1146
0:45:44,280 --> 0:45:46,280
 to avoid

1147
0:45:46,280 --> 0:45:48,280
 attacking people on the internet

1148
0:45:48,280 --> 0:45:50,280
 if you mistype an IP address

1149
0:45:50,280 --> 0:45:52,280
 you might be attacking the NSA so

1150
0:45:52,280 --> 0:45:54,280
 make sure that you do not

1151
0:45:54,280 --> 0:45:56,280
 mistype addresses

1152
0:45:56,280 --> 0:45:58,280
 and as I said at the bottom

1153
0:45:58,280 --> 0:46:00,280
 above or similar can often be found like

1154
0:46:00,280 --> 0:46:02,280
 this

1155
0:46:02,280 --> 0:46:04,280
 I have taken home a lot of equipment

1156
0:46:04,280 --> 0:46:06,280
 over the years and played with it at

1157
0:46:06,280 --> 0:46:08,280
 home to get better in these

1158
0:46:08,280 --> 0:46:10,280
 and being able to actually do stuff

1159
0:46:10,280 --> 0:46:12,280
 with equipment is important

1160
0:46:12,280 --> 0:46:14,280
 I also recommend getting

1161
0:46:14,280 --> 0:46:16,280
 wireless cards and

1162
0:46:16,280 --> 0:46:18,280
 it's always a problem recommending

1163
0:46:18,280 --> 0:46:20,280
 wireless cards because they go through

1164
0:46:20,280 --> 0:46:22,280
 a revision and changes all the time

1165
0:46:22,280 --> 0:46:24,280
 but to learn a lot of these

1166
0:46:24,280 --> 0:46:26,280
 methods and technologies for

1167
0:46:26,280 --> 0:46:28,280
 hacking Wi-Fi you probably can get

1168
0:46:28,280 --> 0:46:30,280
 away with it

1169
0:46:30,280 --> 0:46:32,280
 but to learn a lot of these

1170
0:46:32,280 --> 0:46:34,280
 methods and technologies for

1171
0:46:34,280 --> 0:46:36,280
 hacking Wi-Fi you probably can get away with

1172
0:46:36,280 --> 0:46:38,280
 a cheap one it may be that you have

1173
0:46:38,280 --> 0:46:40,280
 one lying around already it may be

1174
0:46:40,280 --> 0:46:42,280
 that it only supports 2.4 GHz

1175
0:46:42,280 --> 0:46:44,280
 but if you're looking at the security

1176
0:46:44,280 --> 0:46:46,280
 protocols you don't really care if it's

1177
0:46:46,280 --> 0:46:48,280
 5 GHz or 2.4 because the security

1178
0:46:48,280 --> 0:46:50,280
 protocols are the same

1179
0:46:50,280 --> 0:46:52,280
 and the one that I have used a lot of

1180
0:46:52,280 --> 0:46:54,280
 time the TP-Link TL-VN722N

1181
0:46:54,280 --> 0:46:56,280
 that was about 80 Kroner

1182
0:46:56,280 --> 0:46:58,280
 so it's less than a small

1183
0:46:58,280 --> 0:47:00,280
 snack box at the food vendor

1184
0:47:00,280 --> 0:47:02,280
 but if you skip one of these and

1185
0:47:02,280 --> 0:47:04,280
 order a cheap card you can actually

1186
0:47:04,280 --> 0:47:06,280
 start doing Wi-Fi hacking and then

1187
0:47:06,280 --> 0:47:08,280
 later on you may want to buy one that

1188
0:47:08,280 --> 0:47:10,280
 I think the one I have below here

1189
0:47:10,280 --> 0:47:12,280
 that was about 300 or 500

1190
0:47:12,280 --> 0:47:14,280
 Danish Kroner

1191
0:47:14,280 --> 0:47:16,280
 but you don't need the latest and

1192
0:47:16,280 --> 0:47:18,280
 greatest to get started and you can

1193
0:47:18,280 --> 0:47:20,280
 typically find it in discarded piles

1194
0:47:20,280 --> 0:47:22,280
 at work sometimes

1195
0:47:26,280 --> 0:47:28,280
 also if you have money

1196
0:47:28,280 --> 0:47:30,280
 for it buying a USB Ethernet

1197
0:47:30,280 --> 0:47:32,280
 card is a card

1198
0:47:32,280 --> 0:47:34,280
 just a dongle is recommended

1199
0:47:34,280 --> 0:47:36,280
 because then you can actually do

1200
0:47:36,280 --> 0:47:38,280
 very low level looking into

1201
0:47:38,280 --> 0:47:40,280
 packets which is what I really love

1202
0:47:40,280 --> 0:47:42,280
 doing and that will again

1203
0:47:42,280 --> 0:47:44,280
 immediately start to

1204
0:47:44,280 --> 0:47:46,280
 bring up something interesting to

1205
0:47:46,280 --> 0:47:48,280
 look at

1206
0:47:50,280 --> 0:47:52,280
 it's 47 minutes now and I would

1207
0:47:52,280 --> 0:47:54,280
 love to have some questions

1208
0:47:54,280 --> 0:47:56,280
 you can find me at CAM I will be

1209
0:47:56,280 --> 0:47:58,280
 here until Friday you can send me

1210
0:47:58,280 --> 0:48:00,280
 questions via email you can

1211
0:48:00,280 --> 0:48:02,280
 find me on Twitter you can see my

1212
0:48:02,280 --> 0:48:04,280
 mobile number it's signal enabled so

1213
0:48:04,280 --> 0:48:06,280
 you're welcome to ask me questions

1214
0:48:08,280 --> 0:48:10,280
 let's give a round of applause

1215
0:48:20,280 --> 0:48:22,280
 nice talk Kramse

1216
0:48:22,280 --> 0:48:24,280
 I completely agree with

1217
0:48:24,280 --> 0:48:26,280
 basically everything

1218
0:48:26,280 --> 0:48:28,280
 what is your take on the difference

1219
0:48:28,280 --> 0:48:30,280
 between having a formal

1220
0:48:30,280 --> 0:48:32,280
 education and taking certificates

1221
0:48:32,280 --> 0:48:34,280
 and then learning the stuff yourself

1222
0:48:34,280 --> 0:48:36,280
 I see that as three distinct

1223
0:48:36,280 --> 0:48:38,280
 categories how do you see them

1224
0:48:38,280 --> 0:48:40,280
 play together and what should you go for

1225
0:48:40,280 --> 0:48:42,280
 it's a great

1226
0:48:42,280 --> 0:48:44,280
 question and

1227
0:48:44,280 --> 0:48:46,280
 beware when I

1228
0:48:46,280 --> 0:48:48,280
 answer this question now I

1229
0:48:48,280 --> 0:48:50,280
 am definitely

1230
0:48:50,280 --> 0:48:52,280
 not trying to offend anyone

1231
0:48:52,280 --> 0:48:54,280
 I may I'm not a native English speaker

1232
0:48:54,280 --> 0:48:56,280
 so I may use the wrong words and

1233
0:48:56,280 --> 0:48:58,280
 in my family we say it's okay to use

1234
0:48:58,280 --> 0:49:00,280
 the wrong words and then people can ask and

1235
0:49:00,280 --> 0:49:02,280
 we can do a more detailed answer

1236
0:49:02,280 --> 0:49:04,280
 probably explaining more what I

1237
0:49:04,280 --> 0:49:06,280
 mean and think about this so

1238
0:49:06,280 --> 0:49:08,280
 I have a formal education

1239
0:49:08,280 --> 0:49:10,280
 and I'm not using much of my formal

1240
0:49:10,280 --> 0:49:12,280
 education I think some of the most

1241
0:49:12,280 --> 0:49:14,280
 important parts that I learned from

1242
0:49:14,280 --> 0:49:16,280
 computer science at

1243
0:49:16,280 --> 0:49:18,280
 university was to read

1244
0:49:18,280 --> 0:49:20,280
 to write big reports

1245
0:49:20,280 --> 0:49:22,280
 which is a very useful skill in network

1246
0:49:22,280 --> 0:49:24,280
 security but a lot of the network

1247
0:49:24,280 --> 0:49:26,280
 security I have learned

1248
0:49:26,280 --> 0:49:28,280
 informally over the years

1249
0:49:28,280 --> 0:49:30,280
 by things that I have researched

1250
0:49:30,280 --> 0:49:32,280
 myself today you can go to a lot of

1251
0:49:32,280 --> 0:49:34,280
 security conferences but I have learned

1252
0:49:34,280 --> 0:49:36,280
 a lot by investigating myself

1253
0:49:36,280 --> 0:49:38,280
 so if you investigate by yourself

1254
0:49:38,280 --> 0:49:40,280
 read some of these books that I have

1255
0:49:40,280 --> 0:49:42,280
 recommended never take an exam

1256
0:49:42,280 --> 0:49:44,280
 never take a certification

1257
0:49:44,280 --> 0:49:46,280
 you can be an excellent resource

1258
0:49:46,280 --> 0:49:48,280
 but I do think

1259
0:49:48,280 --> 0:49:50,280
 that formal education has its place

1260
0:49:50,280 --> 0:49:52,280
 because you are required

1261
0:49:52,280 --> 0:49:54,280
 to go through some parts and

1262
0:49:54,280 --> 0:49:56,280
 also the parts that you don't really like

1263
0:49:56,280 --> 0:49:58,280
 so you are forced to do

1264
0:49:58,280 --> 0:50:00,280
 some investigation into for instance

1265
0:50:00,280 --> 0:50:02,280
 some of the juniper certifications

1266
0:50:02,280 --> 0:50:04,280
 I had to read pages and pages of OSPF

1267
0:50:04,280 --> 0:50:06,280
 which is a protocol for routing

1268
0:50:06,280 --> 0:50:08,280
 and I had to learn all sorts of different

1269
0:50:08,280 --> 0:50:10,280
 configurations that I

1270
0:50:10,280 --> 0:50:12,280
 have never used

1271
0:50:12,280 --> 0:50:14,280
 but it still required me to learn a little

1272
0:50:14,280 --> 0:50:16,280
 bit about this OSPF

1273
0:50:16,280 --> 0:50:18,280
 so you can definitely work

1274
0:50:18,280 --> 0:50:20,280
 in security without having a formal education

1275
0:50:20,280 --> 0:50:22,280
 but I think your job situation

1276
0:50:22,280 --> 0:50:24,280
 will also be a little bit more

1277
0:50:24,280 --> 0:50:26,280
 risky because if you get fired

1278
0:50:26,280 --> 0:50:28,280
 you don't get a job for a year

1279
0:50:28,280 --> 0:50:30,280
 people might not value the things that you did

1280
0:50:30,280 --> 0:50:32,280
 in your previous job

1281
0:50:32,280 --> 0:50:34,280
 so I hope I didn't offend anyone

1282
0:50:34,280 --> 0:50:36,280
 and you understood what I meant

1283
0:50:36,280 --> 0:50:38,280
 but I really do think

1284
0:50:38,280 --> 0:50:40,280
 that both formal education

1285
0:50:40,280 --> 0:50:42,280
 and certifications has its place

1286
0:50:42,280 --> 0:50:44,280
 and that said

1287
0:50:44,280 --> 0:50:46,280
 I think it's horrible the way

1288
0:50:46,280 --> 0:50:48,280
 that we do these certifications today

1289
0:50:48,280 --> 0:50:50,280
 because I have tried to take one

1290
0:50:50,280 --> 0:50:52,280
 with a proctor that wanted to

1291
0:50:52,280 --> 0:50:54,280
 investigate my underwear more or less

1292
0:50:54,280 --> 0:50:56,280
 I had to put the camera under the table

1293
0:50:56,280 --> 0:50:58,280
 and it does prevent some people

1294
0:50:58,280 --> 0:51:00,280
 from taking these and I think we should

1295
0:51:00,280 --> 0:51:02,280
 try to eliminate that burden

1296
0:51:02,280 --> 0:51:04,280
 I don't know how we would do that

1297
0:51:04,280 --> 0:51:06,280
 open source certifications is not really

1298
0:51:06,280 --> 0:51:08,280
 taking off. I answered that very long

1299
0:51:08,280 --> 0:51:10,280
 We have one more question

1300
0:51:10,280 --> 0:51:12,280
 Thank you

1301
0:51:12,280 --> 0:51:14,280
 You talked a lot about how to

1302
0:51:14,280 --> 0:51:16,280
 increase your confidence with network security

1303
0:51:16,280 --> 0:51:18,280
 a situation I've had for a while

1304
0:51:18,280 --> 0:51:20,280
 that I think is quite common among hackers

1305
0:51:20,280 --> 0:51:22,280
 is I know something about

1306
0:51:22,280 --> 0:51:24,280
 computers

1307
0:51:24,280 --> 0:51:26,280
 and I have no idea how to get a job

1308
0:51:26,280 --> 0:51:28,280
 in computers

1309
0:51:28,280 --> 0:51:30,280
 because that's like a completely different

1310
0:51:30,280 --> 0:51:32,280
 world from actually knowing computers

1311
0:51:32,280 --> 0:51:34,280
 Do you have any

1312
0:51:34,280 --> 0:51:36,280
 advice on this?

1313
0:51:38,280 --> 0:51:40,280
 I do because

1314
0:51:40,280 --> 0:51:42,280
 since we have this extreme

1315
0:51:42,280 --> 0:51:44,280
 shortage we have a very

1316
0:51:44,280 --> 0:51:46,280
 unhealthy environment for

1317
0:51:46,280 --> 0:51:48,280
 computer security people in Denmark

1318
0:51:48,280 --> 0:51:50,280
 because they cannot fulfill the positions

1319
0:51:50,280 --> 0:51:52,280
 so the ones that are working

1320
0:51:52,280 --> 0:51:54,280
 are overworked and so on

1321
0:51:54,280 --> 0:51:56,280
 and I have been

1322
0:51:56,280 --> 0:51:58,280
 discussing how we could bring in people

1323
0:51:58,280 --> 0:52:00,280
 into these areas

1324
0:52:00,280 --> 0:52:02,280
 I think about computers in general

1325
0:52:02,280 --> 0:52:04,280
 but also computer security

1326
0:52:04,280 --> 0:52:06,280
 might actually be easier to get into

1327
0:52:06,280 --> 0:52:08,280
 than the technical parts

1328
0:52:08,280 --> 0:52:10,280
 because in many cases you want to do

1329
0:52:10,280 --> 0:52:12,280
 like reviewing output from tools

1330
0:52:12,280 --> 0:52:14,280
 you want to do like this excel

1331
0:52:14,280 --> 0:52:16,280
 working with risk

1332
0:52:16,280 --> 0:52:18,280
 and stuff like that

1333
0:52:18,280 --> 0:52:20,280
 so my advice would probably

1334
0:52:20,280 --> 0:52:22,280
 try to find some scenarios

1335
0:52:22,280 --> 0:52:24,280
 where you can actually perform

1336
0:52:24,280 --> 0:52:26,280
 some basic tasks

1337
0:52:26,280 --> 0:52:28,280
 and then you will have to go to

1338
0:52:28,280 --> 0:52:30,280
 one of these companies that cannot fulfill

1339
0:52:30,280 --> 0:52:32,280
 the positions

1340
0:52:32,280 --> 0:52:34,280
 and say that you are eager to learn

1341
0:52:34,280 --> 0:52:36,280
 and you may agree

1342
0:52:36,280 --> 0:52:38,280
 again I think it's a little bit

1343
0:52:38,280 --> 0:52:40,280
 because some of the employers will

1344
0:52:40,280 --> 0:52:42,280
 take advantage of this

1345
0:52:42,280 --> 0:52:44,280
 but you can say that you want to

1346
0:52:44,280 --> 0:52:46,280
 start working at a low salary

1347
0:52:46,280 --> 0:52:48,280
 perhaps lower than your colleagues

1348
0:52:48,280 --> 0:52:50,280
 because you do not have the same experience

1349
0:52:50,280 --> 0:52:52,280
 and then you can make an agreement

1350
0:52:52,280 --> 0:52:54,280
 like three months, six months from now

1351
0:52:54,280 --> 0:52:56,280
 we are going to evaluate how much you can fulfill now

1352
0:52:56,280 --> 0:52:58,280
 and you will get the same pay

1353
0:52:58,280 --> 0:53:00,280
 so trying to get an initial low

1354
0:53:00,280 --> 0:53:02,280
 pay and be able to do

1355
0:53:02,280 --> 0:53:04,280
 some basic scenarios

1356
0:53:04,280 --> 0:53:06,280
 from end to end

1357
0:53:06,280 --> 0:53:08,280
 that's actually the important part

1358
0:53:08,280 --> 0:53:10,280
 Do we have a final question?

1359
0:53:10,280 --> 0:53:12,280
 I hope that helps

1360
0:53:12,280 --> 0:53:14,280
 Nope, let's give a round of applause

1361
0:53:14,280 --> 0:53:16,280
 for Kamsi
