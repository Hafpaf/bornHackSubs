0:00:00,000 --> 0:00:16,560
 Thanks for all the organizing and all the volunteers.

2
0:00:17,280 --> 0:00:20,680
 I'm here to speak about a German co-op.

3
0:00:21,260 --> 0:00:24,480
 I hear it's also like a Danish co-op next to the list.

4
0:00:25,440 --> 0:00:26,540
 That's really interesting.

5
0:00:26,540 --> 0:00:33,420
 Yeah, the co-op is called WTF, or like in German, Werkkooperative der Technikfreundinnen.

6
0:00:34,620 --> 0:00:37,980
 But we also had like really nice messages from a banker who was like,

7
0:00:38,080 --> 0:00:42,780
 you know the abbreviation of your cooperative is WTF, and I looked it up on Google.

8
0:00:43,100 --> 0:00:44,060
 It's not a good word.

9
0:00:45,400 --> 0:00:47,420
 So yeah, that is what it is.

10
0:00:48,600 --> 0:00:49,800
 And yes, my name is Gamo.

11
0:00:49,980 --> 0:00:51,360
 I'm like on the board of directors.

12
0:00:52,080 --> 0:00:54,840
 And yeah, but first of all, what is a co-op?

13
0:00:55,220 --> 0:00:56,340
 A co-op is...

14
0:00:56,540 --> 0:00:58,380
 It's basically a company.

15
0:00:58,760 --> 0:01:04,720
 It's an entity which is owned by all of the members.

16
0:01:05,120 --> 0:01:07,160
 And it doesn't matter how many shares you have.

17
0:01:07,340 --> 0:01:10,820
 Unlike in a stock company, every member has like one vote.

18
0:01:11,040 --> 0:01:13,380
 And we are voting like every year for the board of directors.

19
0:01:13,940 --> 0:01:17,320
 And they are deciding like the direction of the company and what things we are doing.

20
0:01:17,700 --> 0:01:21,440
 So it's a really democratic organization and a democratic company.

21
0:01:24,500 --> 0:01:26,160
 Yeah, why use a co-op?

22
0:01:26,540 --> 0:01:31,420
 So in our case, we want to facilitate business for our members.

23
0:01:31,920 --> 0:01:40,020
 So we have like a lot of hackers in our co-op who can use the co-op as like an operating system

24
0:01:40,120 --> 0:01:44,320
 for doing side hustles or other projects.

25
0:01:44,420 --> 0:01:45,620
 And that was like the idea.

26
0:01:46,580 --> 0:01:50,300
 One reason is that because in Germany, there's like a lot of bureaucracy.

27
0:01:50,780 --> 0:01:56,360
 If you are like having a job, it's not like in Denmark where you have like one health insurance.

28
0:01:56,540 --> 0:02:04,180
 But we have rather 100 different companies or non-profit organizations who are facilitating health insurance.

29
0:02:04,440 --> 0:02:06,920
 And we are all quite complicated to work with.

30
0:02:07,480 --> 0:02:13,520
 So it's always easier to have like a salary and have like an employee employment.

31
0:02:14,040 --> 0:02:17,060
 And that is what like the VTF is doing for our members.

32
0:02:17,780 --> 0:02:24,640
 So you can be like a freelancer or you can act or take like all the good things of being a freelancer

33
0:02:24,640 --> 0:02:26,520
 and combining it with all the other things.

34
0:02:26,520 --> 0:02:30,640
 All the easy things about having like an employee and being employed.

35
0:02:31,400 --> 0:02:32,200
 It's also really nice.

36
0:02:32,200 --> 0:02:38,000
 We have like a network of people who are doing things together and we can like do cool stuff.

37
0:02:38,100 --> 0:02:45,640
 And yeah, also trade this information about few things.

38
0:02:45,640 --> 0:02:50,500
 It doesn't matter if you want to like import some electronics or other stuff from China.

39
0:02:50,500 --> 0:02:55,120
 We probably already have someone who has done that and can tell you if it's like a good idea or not.

40
0:02:56,520 --> 0:02:57,020
 Often not.

41
0:02:58,760 --> 0:02:59,260
 Okay.

42
0:03:00,560 --> 0:03:01,620
 That's like one thing.

43
0:03:01,620 --> 0:03:05,200
 I think we already talked about like the frustration about like the German bureaucracy.

44
0:03:05,580 --> 0:03:11,380
 Also like one of our members who was like founder of it, Ayubu, has already worked with like other cooperatives.

45
0:03:12,580 --> 0:03:16,800
 But mostly we are like in really old school things like for example banking or agriculture.

46
0:03:17,200 --> 0:03:22,620
 And as hackers we wanted to have like a cooperative that is really working for like the hacker things.

47
0:03:23,100 --> 0:03:24,820
 And yeah.

48
0:03:26,520 --> 0:03:33,560
 Talking about stats, the VTF-EG was founded in 2020.

49
0:03:33,560 --> 0:03:36,960
 That was like the official start where we did start doing all the work.

50
0:03:36,960 --> 0:03:42,200
 We currently have around 190 members in like different capacities.

51
0:03:42,200 --> 0:03:48,960
 Some of them are just having a membership and supporting it more because of an ideological reason.

52
0:03:48,960 --> 0:03:53,220
 And a few of them are already like really participating with that.

53
0:03:53,220 --> 0:03:54,580
 In the time we had like two different generalists.

54
0:03:54,580 --> 0:03:55,820
 And then we had like a couple of other members.

55
0:03:55,820 --> 0:03:55,840
 And then we had like a couple of other members.

56
0:03:55,840 --> 0:03:56,160
 And then we had like a couple of other members.

57
0:03:56,160 --> 0:03:56,460
 And then we had like a couple of other members.

58
0:03:56,520 --> 0:04:00,640
 So we also voted two times for like our board of directors.

59
0:04:01,540 --> 0:04:03,800
 And having that in mind.

60
0:04:04,220 --> 0:04:08,680
 We also did already collect 94,000 euros for like the members.

61
0:04:09,260 --> 0:04:18,060
 And so that's like the full amount like members had the project or yeah another income.

62
0:04:18,220 --> 0:04:20,140
 And they did invoice it over the VTF.

63
0:04:21,820 --> 0:04:25,460
 One other thing is that you maybe ask okay now I've like done this work.

64
0:04:25,460 --> 0:04:26,500
 I can invoice this thing.

65
0:04:26,520 --> 0:04:28,620
 I can invoice this thing like to the VTF but how do I get it out.

66
0:04:28,620 --> 0:04:41,620
 And that's also like I think maybe some German thing where like some interesting aspects how you can like have like a second job or third job and maybe get like taxation benefits.

67
0:04:41,620 --> 0:04:44,220
 And you also can do that with like the VTF.

68
0:04:44,220 --> 0:04:48,840
 But you also can like use this money for like another project or another ideas.

69
0:04:48,840 --> 0:04:53,260
 So you can be really creative about that and yeah.

70
0:04:53,260 --> 0:04:54,460
 So what can we do?

71
0:04:54,460 --> 0:04:55,180
 So what can we do?

72
0:04:55,180 --> 0:04:55,720
 So what can we do?

73
0:04:55,720 --> 0:04:56,220
 So what can we do?

74
0:04:56,220 --> 0:04:57,060
 What can I do?

75
0:04:59,320 --> 0:05:13,020
 Yeah, I think mostly it's interesting for like probably people wanting to do like projects in Germany and also speaking German because we're not really good at translating and like having all our conversations and discussions also like in another language.

76
0:05:14,520 --> 0:05:25,320
 I think what's also really cool is like to think like how you can use like this corporate co-op structure for like other businesses or ideas, especially if we think about open source.

77
0:05:25,320 --> 0:05:25,920
 And

78
0:05:26,220 --> 0:05:30,360
 And

79
0:05:30,360 --> 0:05:45,360
 like really

80
0:05:45,360 --> 0:05:50,000
 like more of the VTF teams and businesses that who does not have like only the thing at mind to like optimize the earning and profits for like the owners and yeah maybe start some VTF in other countries.

81
0:05:50,000 --> 0:05:50,820
 What's next for the VTF.

82
0:05:50,820 --> 0:05:51,420
 What's next for the VTF.

83
0:05:51,420 --> 0:05:52,600
 One thing we really need to work on which we're really working on is like automation.

84
0:05:52,600 --> 0:05:53,140
 What's next for the VTF.

85
0:05:53,140 --> 0:05:55,120
 What's next for the VTF.

86
0:05:55,120 --> 0:05:56,220
 Currently we have like people who are doing like all the borrowing things like creating invoicing.

87
0:05:56,220 --> 0:06:02,000
 paid and all the other things so we're working to optimize this to really have it with like

88
0:06:02,000 --> 0:06:11,120
 little hassle as possible we're also creating new services for example collecting money if you have

89
0:06:11,120 --> 0:06:17,440
 like a podcast or something like that like having like a cool patreon service and the big thing for

90
0:06:17,440 --> 0:06:22,640
 us also reaching like financial long-term sustainability so making sure that enough

91
0:06:22,640 --> 0:06:28,900
 money is getting in so we can provide like all the development okay thanks for the fish and we

92
0:06:28,900 --> 0:06:33,540
 are contact information and this presentation is also on the archive.org thank you
