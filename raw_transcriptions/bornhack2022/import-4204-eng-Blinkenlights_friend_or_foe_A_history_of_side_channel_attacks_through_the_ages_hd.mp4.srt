2
0:00:14,720 --> 0:00:15,800
 Right, let's begin.

3
0:00:15,800 --> 0:00:17,360
 Blinking lights, friend or foe,

4
0:00:17,360 --> 0:00:19,760
 a history of sideline attacks through the ages.

5
0:00:19,760 --> 0:00:21,600
 First of all, who am I?

6
0:00:23,680 --> 0:00:26,200
 I'm a security consultant at WebSecure.

7
0:00:26,200 --> 0:00:29,160
 I'm also a CTF player for a camera union,

8
0:00:29,160 --> 0:00:32,160
 and I'm also a Bonhack participant here in the Pyjamas camp.

9
0:00:33,640 --> 0:00:36,960
 So a quick TLDR, what is this talk going to cover?

10
0:00:36,960 --> 0:00:40,240
 First of all, if you were expecting it to be about the hit 2000 movie,

11
0:00:40,240 --> 0:00:43,120
 Blinking lights, it's sadly not going to be about that,

12
0:00:43,120 --> 0:00:45,040
 but it is a good movie.

13
0:00:45,040 --> 0:00:48,880
 What we're going to talk about first is what are sideline attacks,

14
0:00:48,880 --> 0:00:54,080
 a history of the sideline attacks starting around the 1940s going up to the 80s.

15
0:00:54,080 --> 0:00:56,480
 We're going to talk about a bunch more sideline attacks,

16
0:00:56,480 --> 0:00:58,880
 how they work, how can we categorize them,

17
0:00:58,880 --> 0:01:03,160
 why attacks like these pop up, and why they matter.

18
0:01:03,160 --> 0:01:07,440
 So first of all, what is a sideline attack?

19
0:01:07,440 --> 0:01:10,520
 And this is the formal definition you'll find if you go on Wikipedia.

20
0:01:10,520 --> 0:01:14,040
 It's a sideline attack is any attack based on extra information

21
0:01:14,040 --> 0:01:16,600
 that can be gathered because of the fundamental way

22
0:01:16,600 --> 0:01:19,760
 a computer protocol or algorithm is implemented,

23
0:01:19,760 --> 0:01:24,080
 rather than flaws in the design of the protocol or algorithm itself.

24
0:01:24,080 --> 0:01:25,920
 I don't agree with this definition.

25
0:01:25,920 --> 0:01:28,560
 For me, it's just any attack being based on...

26
0:01:28,880 --> 0:01:31,640
 information gathered in a fundamental way

27
0:01:31,640 --> 0:01:34,040
 because of how the system is implemented.

28
0:01:34,040 --> 0:01:37,280
 It doesn't have to be on computer protocols or algorithms.

29
0:01:37,280 --> 0:01:40,560
 You can do side channel attacks on anything.

30
0:01:40,560 --> 0:01:43,520
 So start an example, you are a baker in a small town,

31
0:01:43,520 --> 0:01:45,400
 like Gilstedtel here, for example,

32
0:01:45,400 --> 0:01:49,000
 and there opens up a competing baker who starts stealing a lot of your business.

33
0:01:49,000 --> 0:01:50,880
 You're suddenly every single day throwing bread out

34
0:01:50,880 --> 0:01:51,880
 because you're making too much.

35
0:01:51,880 --> 0:01:53,840
 You don't know how many customers you've stolen.

36
0:01:53,840 --> 0:01:55,440
 And of course, you're a bit mad at him.

37
0:01:55,440 --> 0:01:56,400
 You can't just go up and ask him,

38
0:01:56,400 --> 0:01:58,160
 hey, how many people are you selling to?

39
0:01:58,880 --> 0:02:02,440
 So instead, what you do, you go first in the morning,

40
0:02:02,440 --> 0:02:05,040
 you go buy a piece of bread from him, first thing, as soon as he opens,

41
0:02:05,040 --> 0:02:06,480
 and you keep the receipt.

42
0:02:06,480 --> 0:02:09,600
 End of day, you go back, buy another piece of bread or whatever,

43
0:02:09,600 --> 0:02:11,280
 and you get the other receipt.

44
0:02:11,280 --> 0:02:13,640
 You now have two receipts with two order numbers,

45
0:02:13,640 --> 0:02:16,640
 and you can see exactly how many orders were made in the day

46
0:02:16,640 --> 0:02:22,120
 because on all receipts, order numbers like this are sequential most of the time.

47
0:02:22,120 --> 0:02:23,920
 There's nothing technical here.

48
0:02:23,920 --> 0:02:28,680
 It was just a system that was implemented for the rival baker to keep track of how many,

49
0:02:28,880 --> 0:02:30,640
 how many orders he's had.

50
0:02:30,640 --> 0:02:35,360
 You used it for your own advantage to figure out how many customers he's gotten.

51
0:02:35,360 --> 0:02:38,120
 So we start our story in the Second World War,

52
0:02:38,120 --> 0:02:42,960
 where this was what side channel tax started popping up and becoming a thing.

53
0:02:42,960 --> 0:02:45,960
 So right before D-Day, we had the Panzer V Panther tank.

54
0:02:45,960 --> 0:02:49,360
 It was new, created by the Germans, and American tanks,

55
0:02:49,360 --> 0:02:51,760
 it was unknown how effective they were against them.

56
0:02:51,760 --> 0:02:56,800
 However, they had only been seen in Italy so far, so no stress on that front.

57
0:02:56,800 --> 0:02:58,720
 However, in the couple of days

58
0:02:58,880 --> 0:03:02,200
 leading up to D-Day, there were suddenly lots of rumors about these tanks appearing

59
0:03:02,200 --> 0:03:05,200
 in France and Normandy, where the landings would happen,

60
0:03:05,200 --> 0:03:10,200
 and the Allied forces really needed to know how many tanks are going to be there.

61
0:03:10,200 --> 0:03:11,600
 So what did they do?

62
0:03:11,600 --> 0:03:14,440
 For the tanks they already had destroyed or captured,

63
0:03:14,440 --> 0:03:16,360
 they started tearing them apart.

64
0:03:16,360 --> 0:03:21,520
 And inside the gearboxes, the cogwheels were sequentially numbered with their serial numbers.

65
0:03:21,520 --> 0:03:26,200
 And also importantly, it also had the number of what gear mold produced the cogwheel.

66
0:03:26,200 --> 0:03:27,800
 Based off this information,

67
0:03:27,800 --> 0:03:28,840
 they could actually estimate

68
0:03:28,840 --> 0:03:30,640
 how many tanks they had been able to produce,

69
0:03:30,640 --> 0:03:32,080
 because they knew how many gear molds they had,

70
0:03:32,080 --> 0:03:34,720
 and you can't have a tank without a gearbox.

71
0:03:34,720 --> 0:03:39,800
 And they estimated 270 tanks had been produced in February 1944.

72
0:03:39,800 --> 0:03:43,240
 And this was substantially higher than any rumors that they had.

73
0:03:43,240 --> 0:03:45,080
 So this was really important information to get.

74
0:03:45,080 --> 0:03:47,360
 They could prepare for this.

75
0:03:47,360 --> 0:03:53,800
 After the war, documents confirmed 276 Panzer V Panther tanks had been produced.

76
0:03:53,800 --> 0:03:57,960
 They had estimated this just off the serial numbers on gearboxes.

77
0:03:57,960 --> 0:04:01,080
 This is honestly where I would start saying side-channel attacks.

78
0:04:01,080 --> 0:04:06,320
 This is where they started getting used in military applications or by governments for attackers.

79
0:04:06,320 --> 0:04:08,320
 There was a system that was introduced.

80
0:04:08,320 --> 0:04:10,440
 Without consideration of every single part of it,

81
0:04:10,440 --> 0:04:15,280
 they didn't consider how could the serial numbers on gears be abused.

82
0:04:15,280 --> 0:04:18,160
 And it was abused.

83
0:04:18,160 --> 0:04:21,240
 Next up, we have the 131 B-2 Mixer.

84
0:04:21,240 --> 0:04:24,880
 This was an encrypted teleprinter in use during the Second World War,

85
0:04:24,880 --> 0:04:26,880
 and it was built off the one-time pad principle.

86
0:04:27,960 --> 0:04:32,760
 And it was basically built with a whole bunch of electromechanical relays or switches,

87
0:04:32,760 --> 0:04:37,840
 which turns out they actually gave off quite a bit of electromagnetic radiation.

88
0:04:37,840 --> 0:04:41,200
 And turns out by observing this information here,

89
0:04:41,200 --> 0:04:44,400
 you could actually figure out the plain text.

90
0:04:44,400 --> 0:04:49,040
 And this was actually Alexander Graham Bell of the Bell Telephone Company

91
0:04:49,040 --> 0:04:51,120
 who discovered this attack.

92
0:04:51,120 --> 0:04:57,280
 And he researched and he found there was three different radiated signals that were of importance.

93
0:04:57,280 --> 0:05:01,800
 There was just signals, the standard EMF radiation in the local area.

94
0:05:01,800 --> 0:05:07,280
 There was noise being carried by the communication wires in which the plain text could be snatched up.

95
0:05:07,280 --> 0:05:10,040
 And there was through the magnetic fields as well.

96
0:05:10,040 --> 0:05:15,760
 So we created a new version, the 131 A-1, which had shielding and filtering and stuff like that.

97
0:05:15,760 --> 0:05:18,200
 But it was large. It was unwieldy.

98
0:05:18,200 --> 0:05:20,920
 It didn't really work on the battlefield.

99
0:05:20,920 --> 0:05:24,160
 Turns out we just implemented a 30-meter perimeter around the thing,

100
0:05:24,160 --> 0:05:26,640
 and that kind of solved most of the issues at least.

101
0:05:26,640 --> 0:05:28,400
 Made it safe enough to use.

102
0:05:28,400 --> 0:05:30,320
 However, it turns out later in 1951,

103
0:05:30,320 --> 0:05:34,400
 the CIA discovered they could retrieve the signals from this half a kilometer away

104
0:05:34,400 --> 0:05:36,240
 due to the noise being sent through the signals.

105
0:05:36,240 --> 0:05:39,920
 And we're like, oh no, we've got to fix it because they'd still been using the same system.

106
0:05:39,920 --> 0:05:43,840
 And then they started developing signal and power line filters.

107
0:05:43,840 --> 0:05:48,120
 They started isolating it as much as they could.

108
0:05:48,120 --> 0:05:49,560
 And it kind of turned into a cat and mouse game

109
0:05:49,560 --> 0:05:52,360
 because this machine was also quite loud while it was encrypting.

110
0:05:52,360 --> 0:05:54,560
 All these switches were triggering.

111
0:05:54,560 --> 0:05:56,640
 Turns out you could also, through just listening to it,

112
0:05:56,640 --> 0:05:58,520
 you could extract the plain text as well.

113
0:05:58,520 --> 0:06:02,040
 So they soundproofed the room and they soundproofed the box the room was in.

114
0:06:02,040 --> 0:06:04,600
 Turns out it just made the signals easier to record.

115
0:06:04,600 --> 0:06:07,360
 So they just created a 100-meter perimeter and said,

116
0:06:07,360 --> 0:06:09,440
 okay, you know what, let's get onwards with it.

117
0:06:09,440 --> 0:06:11,960
 We kind of got to get something else.

118
0:06:11,960 --> 0:06:14,080
 But this is where they were like, oh shit,

119
0:06:14,080 --> 0:06:18,920
 we've got to do something about these signals that are being radiated out.

120
0:06:18,920 --> 0:06:22,560
 Next up towards the end of the war in 1944,

121
0:06:22,560 --> 0:06:25,680
 the Russians and the U.S. were still in good terms there.

122
0:06:25,680 --> 0:06:26,400
 So, I don't know if you've heard this, but the Russians and the U.S. were still in good terms there.

123
0:06:26,400 --> 0:06:26,600
 So, I don't know if you've heard this, but the Russians and the U.S. were still in good terms there.

124
0:06:26,640 --> 0:06:26,720
 So, I don't know if you've heard this, but the Russians and the U.S. were still in good terms there.

125
0:06:26,720 --> 0:06:26,760
 So, I don't know if you've heard this, but the Russians and the U.S. were still in good terms there.

126
0:06:26,760 --> 0:06:26,800
 So, I don't know if you've heard this, but the Russians and the U.S. were still in good terms there.

127
0:06:26,800 --> 0:06:30,640
 A bunch of Russian boy scouts, they gifted this lovely wooden seal

128
0:06:30,640 --> 0:06:33,600
 to the U.S. ambassador in the Soviet Union.

129
0:06:33,600 --> 0:06:37,320
 And yeah, okay, it's still something gifted by the Soviet Union,

130
0:06:37,320 --> 0:06:38,600
 you don't really trust it.

131
0:06:38,600 --> 0:06:41,240
 But they scanned it with nonlinear junction detectors,

132
0:06:41,240 --> 0:06:44,400
 which basically just search for active electronics.

133
0:06:44,400 --> 0:06:46,040
 They couldn't find anything.

134
0:06:46,040 --> 0:06:49,000
 As far as they knew, it was just a piece of wood

135
0:06:49,000 --> 0:06:51,440
 carved into the U.S. seal there.

136
0:06:52,960 --> 0:06:55,200
 Key word was active components.

137
0:06:55,200 --> 0:06:56,400
 Inside there was a complete,

138
0:06:56,400 --> 0:07:00,520
 completely passive bug where it consisted of an antenna

139
0:07:00,520 --> 0:07:01,520
 and a membrane.

140
0:07:01,520 --> 0:07:04,920
 And the membrane essentially being just a piece of plastic.

141
0:07:04,920 --> 0:07:08,440
 Sound waves inside the room would vibrate this membrane,

142
0:07:08,440 --> 0:07:10,560
 which was attached to the antenna.

143
0:07:10,560 --> 0:07:12,600
 And what happened is this antenna,

144
0:07:12,600 --> 0:07:15,640
 when you hit it with the right frequency radio signal,

145
0:07:15,640 --> 0:07:18,720
 it would then resonate and it will give off its own signal,

146
0:07:18,720 --> 0:07:20,600
 which could be picked up by radio.

147
0:07:20,600 --> 0:07:23,400
 And the sound waves would then modulate the people talking

148
0:07:23,400 --> 0:07:26,160
 within the room, this signal onto the,

149
0:07:26,160 --> 0:07:27,880
 repeated signal.

150
0:07:27,880 --> 0:07:30,160
 And so it turns out you could,

151
0:07:30,160 --> 0:07:34,600
 they sent a 300 kilohertz signal, I believe it was, to it.

152
0:07:34,600 --> 0:07:36,320
 And then they could hear everything that was going on

153
0:07:36,320 --> 0:07:38,480
 inside the ambassador's private quarters,

154
0:07:38,480 --> 0:07:40,320
 which is quite a lot of information leaked.

155
0:07:40,320 --> 0:07:43,200
 Turns out then in 1951, a British radio operator

156
0:07:43,200 --> 0:07:45,960
 at the British embassy, just down the road,

157
0:07:45,960 --> 0:07:49,000
 he was listening to open Soviet Air Force radio channels,

158
0:07:49,000 --> 0:07:50,680
 and suddenly he heard the U.S. ambassador

159
0:07:50,680 --> 0:07:52,960
 to the Soviet Union talking.

160
0:07:52,960 --> 0:07:54,720
 Kind of bad, doesn't really work.

161
0:07:56,160 --> 0:07:59,880
 And turns out, just a couple of fun facts about this.

162
0:07:59,880 --> 0:08:01,520
 One, it was created by Leon Farriman,

163
0:08:01,520 --> 0:08:03,760
 the guy who created the Farriman instrument.

164
0:08:03,760 --> 0:08:06,960
 And it's also essentially how RFID works.

165
0:08:06,960 --> 0:08:10,400
 You send a radio signal, resonate an antenna,

166
0:08:10,400 --> 0:08:12,280
 and you get data out from that.

167
0:08:12,280 --> 0:08:15,080
 But this is where side channel attacks had begun.

168
0:08:17,160 --> 0:08:18,760
 Introducing Tempest.

169
0:08:18,760 --> 0:08:20,560
 Tempest was then a U.S. code word

170
0:08:20,560 --> 0:08:23,280
 for dealing with side channel attacks.

171
0:08:23,280 --> 0:08:25,880
 It has then been backronym to telecommunications electronics,

172
0:08:25,880 --> 0:08:29,720
 material protected from emanating spurious transmissions.

173
0:08:29,720 --> 0:08:31,480
 And I will not be repeating that.

174
0:08:33,240 --> 0:08:35,480
 But it's both a set of standards

175
0:08:35,480 --> 0:08:37,880
 for protecting hardware from leaking signals.

176
0:08:37,880 --> 0:08:41,560
 It's also just the term for all side channel attacks

177
0:08:41,560 --> 0:08:43,160
 that the NSA use.

178
0:08:43,160 --> 0:08:46,280
 It's just attacks that attack systems

179
0:08:46,280 --> 0:08:47,680
 and not attack it directly,

180
0:08:47,680 --> 0:08:49,400
 but what's getting leaked out of it.

181
0:08:49,400 --> 0:08:51,720
 These standards, it leads to development of things

182
0:08:51,720 --> 0:08:53,440
 such as red-black separation,

183
0:08:53,440 --> 0:08:55,680
 where there physically has to be a few centimeters

184
0:08:55,680 --> 0:08:58,160
 of separation between red wires and black wires,

185
0:08:58,160 --> 0:09:00,000
 where black wires carry plain text

186
0:09:00,000 --> 0:09:02,480
 and red wires carry only cipher text.

187
0:09:03,800 --> 0:09:07,960
 And then 1958, first policy regarding EMF radiation standards

188
0:09:07,960 --> 0:09:10,880
 for military use was put in place.

189
0:09:10,880 --> 0:09:12,640
 It was stopped, U.S. came with it first,

190
0:09:12,640 --> 0:09:15,040
 but it was quickly adopted by Canada, UK,

191
0:09:15,040 --> 0:09:18,280
 and other allied forces at least.

192
0:09:18,280 --> 0:09:20,440
 And with the Cold War well underway,

193
0:09:20,440 --> 0:09:23,280
 they really needed to start controlling these signals.

194
0:09:23,280 --> 0:09:24,920
 Because at the same time,

195
0:09:24,920 --> 0:09:29,600
 over 900 different listening devices and sensors

196
0:09:29,600 --> 0:09:31,200
 had been found in U.S. installations

197
0:09:31,200 --> 0:09:32,520
 behind the Iron Curtain.

198
0:09:33,720 --> 0:09:36,160
 You could not just ignore tempest leakages.

199
0:09:36,160 --> 0:09:38,400
 This was something they had to take care of.

200
0:09:38,400 --> 0:09:40,560
 This led to a whole bunch of developments,

201
0:09:40,560 --> 0:09:43,200
 such as what's called inside rooms.

202
0:09:43,200 --> 0:09:46,680
 So they took an anechoic chamber like this,

203
0:09:46,680 --> 0:09:48,840
 and they put another room inside of it

204
0:09:48,840 --> 0:09:51,480
 to avoid any signals leaking out.

205
0:09:51,480 --> 0:09:54,440
 And we also have rooms like these, which just isolate,

206
0:09:54,440 --> 0:09:57,840
 isolate completely for RF radiation as well.

207
0:09:57,840 --> 0:10:01,200
 And what was our one issue is all the employees

208
0:10:01,200 --> 0:10:03,800
 of these embassies and that,

209
0:10:03,800 --> 0:10:05,880
 they kind of refer to these as the meat lockers

210
0:10:05,880 --> 0:10:06,720
 because they were really hot,

211
0:10:06,720 --> 0:10:08,640
 so we just left the door open,

212
0:10:08,640 --> 0:10:10,840
 kind of ruining the entire attack.

213
0:10:10,840 --> 0:10:12,760
 But you can buy one, first of all,

214
0:10:12,760 --> 0:10:14,360
 you can buy one of these boxes for yourself,

215
0:10:14,360 --> 0:10:16,400
 a couple of million dollars if you want.

216
0:10:16,400 --> 0:10:18,280
 Second of all, they're not just used

217
0:10:18,280 --> 0:10:20,840
 for protecting against military attacks,

218
0:10:20,840 --> 0:10:24,120
 so that if you do any research regarding radar waves,

219
0:10:24,120 --> 0:10:26,160
 for example, you're going to be doing it

220
0:10:26,160 --> 0:10:27,840
 inside one of these rooms.

221
0:10:27,840 --> 0:10:29,800
 It's essentially a big Faraday cage.

222
0:10:29,800 --> 0:10:31,480
 But also, if you have an installation

223
0:10:31,480 --> 0:10:33,440
 where secure numbers are being generated,

224
0:10:33,440 --> 0:10:35,520
 such as in banking sector, stuff like that,

225
0:10:35,520 --> 0:10:37,320
 it also occurs within one of these rooms

226
0:10:37,320 --> 0:10:41,000
 because this security needs to be taken seriously.

227
0:10:41,000 --> 0:10:42,840
 And so on, this cat and mouse game

228
0:10:42,840 --> 0:10:46,400
 between both the Americans and the Russians

229
0:10:46,400 --> 0:10:48,080
 and side channel attacks on both sides

230
0:10:48,080 --> 0:10:51,080
 continued at least until the 80s,

231
0:10:51,080 --> 0:10:53,680
 beginning the age of hackers, at least

232
0:10:54,120 --> 0:10:56,080
 in the 1980s,

233
0:10:56,080 --> 0:10:57,520
 and then the 80s,

234
0:10:57,520 --> 0:10:59,120
 when the 80s came along,

235
0:10:59,120 --> 0:11:00,640
 and the 80s was the time

236
0:11:00,640 --> 0:11:03,040
 when the world was going through a lot of chaos.

237
0:11:03,040 --> 0:11:05,000
 And so far, all these attacks,

238
0:11:05,000 --> 0:11:06,600
 they had been government only.

239
0:11:06,600 --> 0:11:10,040
 It was quite massive amount of resources in that.

240
0:11:10,040 --> 0:11:12,720
 But the 80s, computers starting to become pretty popular.

241
0:11:12,720 --> 0:11:14,320
 I'm pretty sure there's several people in the audience

242
0:11:14,320 --> 0:11:17,160
 who were already playing with their first computers back then.

243
0:11:17,160 --> 0:11:20,560
 And I'm just going to cut to a BBC video clip from the 80s

244
0:11:20,560 --> 0:11:22,240
 because it just explains what happened

245
0:11:22,240 --> 0:11:24,080
 so much better than I ever could.

246
0:11:24,120 --> 0:11:25,720
 This receiving system here,

247
0:11:25,720 --> 0:11:27,800
 that's not linked to it in any way at all.

248
0:11:27,800 --> 0:11:29,440
 It's only £100 worth of equipment,

249
0:11:29,440 --> 0:11:31,680
 so it's not the greatest picture,

250
0:11:31,680 --> 0:11:33,920
 and I'll try and stabilise it a bit there.

251
0:11:33,920 --> 0:11:36,320
 And if I move the aerial,

252
0:11:36,320 --> 0:11:39,400
 you can see that the information disappears off the screen.

253
0:11:39,400 --> 0:11:43,320
 Move it back, and it returns.

254
0:11:43,320 --> 0:11:45,920
 Now, all we've got here is an ordinary television set

255
0:11:45,920 --> 0:11:47,600
 with an aerial and an amplifier

256
0:11:47,600 --> 0:11:50,120
 and a rather special, if cheap, box of tricks.

257
0:11:50,120 --> 0:11:52,720
 But we had to go to the Dr. Nair Laboratories in Holland

258
0:11:52,720 --> 0:11:53,840
 to get hold of it.

259
0:11:54,120 --> 0:11:56,160
 And actually, they use this equipment quite legally

260
0:11:56,160 --> 0:11:58,280
 to investigate this very problem.

261
0:11:58,280 --> 0:12:01,720
 And they were the only people who we knew

262
0:12:01,720 --> 0:12:04,960
 who could find out and would admit to having it.

263
0:12:04,960 --> 0:12:08,080
 Well, we've seen it working in the controlled conditions of the studio,

264
0:12:08,080 --> 0:12:12,080
 but yesterday, we set this up to see how it would work outside.

265
0:12:12,080 --> 0:12:14,080
 There you go.

266
0:12:14,080 --> 0:12:17,760
 So, as you can see, we're outside an office block in West London,

267
0:12:17,760 --> 0:12:20,440
 and we found that there's a VDU screen operating

268
0:12:20,440 --> 0:12:23,840
 about halfway up the building, probably on the seventh or eighth floor.

269
0:12:24,120 --> 0:12:28,960
 And in fact, it's a letter being typed out on that screen.

270
0:12:28,960 --> 0:12:30,560
 I can actually read it here.

271
0:12:30,560 --> 0:12:34,800
 It says, Dear Mr. Jackson, thank you for your...

272
0:12:34,800 --> 0:12:40,240
 Whoops. Thank you for your letter requesting the use...

273
0:12:40,240 --> 0:12:41,600
 Whoops, I've lost it again.

274
0:12:41,600 --> 0:12:44,440
 ...requesting the use of our facilities.

275
0:12:44,440 --> 0:12:47,120
 At least stop the video there.

276
0:12:47,120 --> 0:12:50,480
 But what had happened was someone called Wim van Eyck,

277
0:12:50,480 --> 0:12:53,080
 he had discovered what's called van Eyck phreaking.

278
0:12:53,080 --> 0:12:53,960
 And they even said they could do it

279
0:12:53,960 --> 0:12:56,400
 for a hundred pounds.

280
0:12:56,400 --> 0:12:59,600
 Turns out you could actually do it for like a hundred kroners' worth of equipment.

281
0:12:59,600 --> 0:13:01,600
 You could read the signals being...

282
0:13:01,600 --> 0:13:05,960
 that were coming off from a CRT monitor remotely from large distances.

283
0:13:05,960 --> 0:13:08,120
 And this was kind of a big deal,

284
0:13:08,120 --> 0:13:10,520
 because he had done it as a private person

285
0:13:10,520 --> 0:13:12,080
 with a hundred kroners' worth of equipment,

286
0:13:12,080 --> 0:13:15,440
 antenna and something, bought a radio shack, basically.

287
0:13:15,440 --> 0:13:18,000
 Everyone thought so far, oh no, attacks like these,

288
0:13:18,000 --> 0:13:22,480
 only... it's only governments we need to take care of it, threat actors.

289
0:13:22,480 --> 0:13:23,760
 But turns out everyone could,

290
0:13:23,960 --> 0:13:26,000
 and this kind of split the entire field.

291
0:13:26,000 --> 0:13:27,800
 Everyone was rushing.

292
0:13:27,800 --> 0:13:31,600
 And from here, we kind of can't really talk about like,

293
0:13:31,600 --> 0:13:34,480
 historically, what side channel attacks come on next,

294
0:13:34,480 --> 0:13:37,200
 because there are just so many attacks.

295
0:13:37,200 --> 0:13:39,600
 It's more important to talk about them in general.

296
0:13:41,040 --> 0:13:44,280
 So for next up here, the implications of aesthetics.

297
0:13:44,280 --> 0:13:45,680
 Everyone's seen a network switch,

298
0:13:45,680 --> 0:13:47,480
 and on every single network switch in the world,

299
0:13:47,480 --> 0:13:52,480
 there is a small activity LEDs there saying what ports are active.

300
0:13:53,960 --> 0:13:57,560
 Or as we like to call them, blinking lights.

301
0:13:57,560 --> 0:14:00,080
 This led to this lovely sign being created,

302
0:14:00,080 --> 0:14:06,320
 which it turns out this sign had actually been hanging around IBM computer rooms since 1955.

303
0:14:06,320 --> 0:14:08,200
 And it says,

304
0:14:08,200 --> 0:14:11,040
 .

305
0:14:11,040 --> 0:14:15,440
 .

306
0:14:15,440 --> 0:14:21,360
 .

307
0:14:21,360 --> 0:14:23,040
 .

308
0:14:23,040 --> 0:14:34,360
 .

309
0:14:34,360 --> 0:14:38,200
 But back to the diagnostic LEDs, back to the network switch.

310
0:14:38,200 --> 0:14:40,000
 And let's put yourself in the shoes.

311
0:14:40,000 --> 0:14:42,880
 You are an engineer that's been tasked to build the network switch,

312
0:14:42,880 --> 0:14:47,320
 and specifically, you have to create these activity LEDs.

313
0:14:47,320 --> 0:14:51,120
 We have the pin out here of an ethernet cable, RJ45 cable,

314
0:14:51,120 --> 0:14:52,520
 where, of course, you can see there's

315
0:14:52,520 --> 0:14:55,040
 just RX plus minus.

316
0:14:55,040 --> 0:14:59,200
 So why don't we just hook the LED directly up to that wire there?

317
0:14:59,200 --> 0:15:01,760
 And then we don't have to create any fancy electronics

318
0:15:01,760 --> 0:15:06,200
 to handle to figure out when these ports are active.

319
0:15:06,200 --> 0:15:10,120
 Does anyone see the problem here?

320
0:15:10,120 --> 0:15:13,760
 In 2002, Joe Lurie and David A. Umphress,

321
0:15:13,760 --> 0:15:15,960
 they had a research paper came out titled,

322
0:15:15,960 --> 0:15:18,960
 Information Leakage from Optical Ammonitions.

323
0:15:18,960 --> 0:15:21,840
 They had realized you can just record the LED, and that way,

324
0:15:21,840 --> 0:15:25,840
 you can get all the data coming off the cable.

325
0:15:25,840 --> 0:15:27,000
 Bit of an issue.

326
0:15:27,000 --> 0:15:29,800
 And this, everyone, when this paper came out, were like,

327
0:15:29,800 --> 0:15:32,080
 holy shit, we've been idiots.

328
0:15:32,080 --> 0:15:35,720
 Why did we not think about this?

329
0:15:35,720 --> 0:15:38,400
 So we're now just going to go talk about the different types

330
0:15:38,400 --> 0:15:40,920
 of side channel attacks of these, because there are a lot.

331
0:15:40,920 --> 0:15:45,320
 And this is generally how they do get categorized.

332
0:15:45,320 --> 0:15:48,200
 So for timing attacks, if we have this little snippet of code

333
0:15:48,200 --> 0:15:51,680
 here, which checks passwords, we can see we loop over.

334
0:15:51,680 --> 0:15:54,920
 We can see the correct password and the input.

335
0:15:54,920 --> 0:15:57,560
 And we check each character if they match.

336
0:15:57,560 --> 0:16:00,440
 If the character doesn't match, we break.

337
0:16:00,440 --> 0:16:02,320
 Obviously, what we can do is we can just

338
0:16:02,320 --> 0:16:03,760
 start checking the first character

339
0:16:03,760 --> 0:16:06,560
 for every single A, B, C, D, E, F, G.

340
0:16:06,560 --> 0:16:09,920
 And at one point, we're going to have one of these calls

341
0:16:09,920 --> 0:16:12,000
 to the password checking function, which is going

342
0:16:12,000 --> 0:16:14,360
 to take a little bit longer.

343
0:16:14,360 --> 0:16:17,080
 When we have that one that's a little bit longer,

344
0:16:17,080 --> 0:16:19,120
 we know we have the correct letter map position.

345
0:16:19,120 --> 0:16:21,480
 We go onwards to the next position.

346
0:16:21,480 --> 0:16:22,520
 This is a timing attack.

347
0:16:22,520 --> 0:16:25,120
 It's easy to abuse, at least, if you just

348
0:16:25,120 --> 0:16:28,040
 can get accurate timing out.

349
0:16:28,040 --> 0:16:29,840
 Next up, we have power monitoring attacks.

350
0:16:29,840 --> 0:16:34,600
 These are mostly known for the AES differential power analysis

351
0:16:34,600 --> 0:16:35,400
 attacks.

352
0:16:35,400 --> 0:16:39,240
 This is where, by looking at the power usage of a CPU

353
0:16:39,240 --> 0:16:43,200
 doing AES encryption, you can actually extract the key.

354
0:16:43,200 --> 0:16:47,000
 And honestly, I could talk about power monitoring attacks

355
0:16:47,000 --> 0:16:49,140
 for absolutely ages.

356
0:16:49,140 --> 0:16:51,380
 So I realized I just brought the hardware with me here

357
0:16:51,380 --> 0:16:52,100
 to bone hack.

358
0:16:52,100 --> 0:16:55,220
 And later today, like midnight-ish,

359
0:16:55,220 --> 0:16:57,920
 going to hold a very impromptu hardware hacking workshop

360
0:16:57,920 --> 0:17:02,960
 where we're going to do a power monitoring attack like this.

361
0:17:02,960 --> 0:17:05,540
 Next up, we have cache attacks.

362
0:17:05,540 --> 0:17:07,040
 This was Meltdown and Spectre.

363
0:17:07,040 --> 0:17:10,180
 These were two attacks which came out in 2018.

364
0:17:10,180 --> 0:17:12,640
 And for those of you who aren't massive security nerds,

365
0:17:12,640 --> 0:17:14,600
 you might have heard your security nerd friends

366
0:17:14,600 --> 0:17:16,100
 talking about this.

367
0:17:16,100 --> 0:17:20,520
 But essentially, all processors nowadays, or back

368
0:17:20,520 --> 0:17:21,340
 before this tech came.

369
0:17:21,340 --> 0:17:23,800
 And they still do it as well, did what's

370
0:17:23,800 --> 0:17:26,260
 called speculative execution, where they just

371
0:17:26,260 --> 0:17:28,920
 try to guess what you were going to do next.

372
0:17:28,920 --> 0:17:31,620
 If you had an if statement, it would execute both branches.

373
0:17:31,620 --> 0:17:34,300
 Because why wait for user input when you can already

374
0:17:34,300 --> 0:17:36,120
 get the data ready?

375
0:17:36,120 --> 0:17:40,000
 Issue was, this meant you could load secrets into cache

376
0:17:40,000 --> 0:17:42,660
 and then not go down that execution path.

377
0:17:42,660 --> 0:17:44,860
 And you could then read those secrets out of the cache

378
0:17:44,860 --> 0:17:46,720
 because the cache didn't get wiped.

379
0:17:46,720 --> 0:17:49,180
 This could then be used to, example, leak passwords

380
0:17:49,180 --> 0:17:50,140
 from another browser's app.

381
0:17:50,140 --> 0:17:50,460
 And quite frankly, this is not the case.

382
0:17:50,460 --> 0:17:50,820
 This is not the case.

383
0:17:50,820 --> 0:17:50,980
 This is not the case.

384
0:17:50,980 --> 0:17:51,020
 This is not the case.

385
0:17:51,020 --> 0:17:51,060
 This is not the case.

386
0:17:51,060 --> 0:17:51,140
 This is not the case.

387
0:17:51,140 --> 0:17:51,320
 This is not the case.

388
0:17:51,320 --> 0:17:51,800
 This is not the case.

389
0:17:51,800 --> 0:17:52,300
 This is not the case.

390
0:17:52,300 --> 0:17:52,740
 This is not the case.

391
0:17:52,740 --> 0:17:54,260
 Quite effectively, these attacks here,

392
0:17:54,260 --> 0:17:57,420
 they were in charge of massive slowdown

393
0:17:57,420 --> 0:17:59,580
 for cloud computing systems.

394
0:17:59,580 --> 0:18:01,660
 And if you ever start up a VM nowadays,

395
0:18:01,660 --> 0:18:02,620
 you'll get that option.

396
0:18:02,620 --> 0:18:04,420
 And it will often be recommended,

397
0:18:04,420 --> 0:18:07,440
 which is in your own laptop, to disable side channel attack

398
0:18:07,440 --> 0:18:12,240
 mitigations, which mitigate attacks like these.

399
0:18:12,240 --> 0:18:13,980
 Next up, we have acoustic attacks

400
0:18:13,980 --> 0:18:16,440
 where there's small video running in the background here.

401
0:18:16,440 --> 0:18:17,820
 But this is an attack where someone

402
0:18:17,820 --> 0:18:21,120
 has trained the machine learning model to listen to what's,

403
0:18:21,120 --> 0:18:23,500
 listen to what's being typed.

404
0:18:24,180 --> 0:18:25,940
 And you see here, he's running it on his phone.

405
0:18:26,880 --> 0:18:28,400
 No cable plugged in there.

406
0:18:29,580 --> 0:18:31,400
 Goes down to the bottom of the screen there.

407
0:18:32,580 --> 0:18:33,700
 And he just starts recording.

408
0:18:33,780 --> 0:18:34,780
 Of course, permissions pop up.

409
0:18:36,120 --> 0:18:37,880
 Starts recording what's being typed.

410
0:18:38,920 --> 0:18:40,780
 And very quickly, we'll go on here.

411
0:18:41,180 --> 0:18:42,700
 You'll see he's going to hold up a phone,

412
0:18:42,700 --> 0:18:45,440
 and it's basically going to be a one-to-one recreation of what he typed.

413
0:18:46,020 --> 0:18:48,480
 Now, he did train this specifically for his keyboard.

414
0:18:48,480 --> 0:18:53,060
 However, if you can get enough training data for your victim's keyboard,

415
0:18:53,440 --> 0:18:55,700
 then you could also easily execute this attack.

416
0:18:56,480 --> 0:19:00,140
 There's also research out there which suggests you can do acoustic attacks

417
0:19:00,140 --> 0:19:03,620
 by listening to the stresses in a heat sink

418
0:19:03,620 --> 0:19:07,240
 that occur from the changing temperatures during encryption.

419
0:19:08,680 --> 0:19:11,080
 That is my face when I read that.

420
0:19:11,400 --> 0:19:14,480
 It should not make any sense that that happens,

421
0:19:15,120 --> 0:19:17,880
 but apparently we can listen to heat sinks.

422
0:19:17,880 --> 0:19:18,000
 Yes.

423
0:19:18,000 --> 0:19:20,040
 And that way gain useful information.

424
0:19:21,320 --> 0:19:23,260
 There's also software-initiated attacks

425
0:19:23,260 --> 0:19:25,740
 where Rowhammer, a lot of people might have heard of,

426
0:19:26,240 --> 0:19:28,160
 but if you haven't, what you did is

427
0:19:28,160 --> 0:19:32,220
 you had your victim row in a memory

428
0:19:32,220 --> 0:19:34,900
 where you could figure out where this was

429
0:19:34,900 --> 0:19:36,880
 with some low-level Linux knowledge.

430
0:19:36,880 --> 0:19:39,660
 At least, and say, for example, in this victim row,

431
0:19:40,040 --> 0:19:43,220
 there was the bits being stored which said what permissions you had.

432
0:19:44,040 --> 0:19:47,540
 Turns out you could then aggressively toggle the rows

433
0:19:47,540 --> 0:19:47,880
 next to each other.

434
0:19:47,880 --> 0:19:47,980
 So you could do that.

435
0:19:48,000 --> 0:19:49,660
 And then you could actually switch bits to it on and off repeatedly,

436
0:19:50,060 --> 0:19:52,400
 and it would actually flip bits in the victim row

437
0:19:52,400 --> 0:19:53,840
 if you didn't have error-correcting memory.

438
0:19:54,600 --> 0:19:57,480
 And you could then, for example, flip bits,

439
0:19:57,580 --> 0:19:59,340
 and if you got lucky, you suddenly got admin

440
0:19:59,340 --> 0:20:00,740
 because you flipped the bits correctly.

441
0:20:02,380 --> 0:20:06,160
 There's also optical attacks, and this is a really fun one

442
0:20:06,160 --> 0:20:08,560
 because I'm pretty sure someone here upon hack

443
0:20:08,560 --> 0:20:09,560
 has all the equipment needed.

444
0:20:10,600 --> 0:20:14,300
 And while we already covered stuff like looking at activity LEDs

445
0:20:14,300 --> 0:20:17,600
 on switches, we can also use lasers for optical attacks.

446
0:20:18,000 --> 0:20:36,680
 So here, by taking a laser pointer, pointing it at a window, and then capturing the reflected beam from the laser on a photocell, soldering that photocell to an AUX cable, plugging it into your laptop and opening Audacity, you can record what the laser is picking up by what it's pointed at.

447
0:20:36,680 --> 0:20:43,060
 So if it's pointed at a window, the glass will vibrate, and you can then listen to it from there, from a distance.

448
0:20:43,060 --> 0:20:51,980
 We also just covered that you can listen to keyboard recording and capture text like that, and lasers can go pretty far if you have a strong laser.

449
0:20:53,300 --> 0:21:01,840
 Now, just one thing, this is very illegal if you don't have permission to do it, so don't go about just doing it regularly, even though it is that simple.

450
0:21:02,480 --> 0:21:05,840
 And it also doesn't have to be on a piece of glass that you're recording from.

451
0:21:06,060 --> 0:21:08,900
 It could be anything that vibrates, so a bag of chips.

452
0:21:09,080 --> 0:21:12,900
 If you've ever been in a really top-secret meeting, there's going to be no...

453
0:21:13,060 --> 0:21:16,420
 No recording allowed, because you don't actually need the laser pointer.

454
0:21:16,800 --> 0:21:26,020
 A video from the room, and something vibrating in the room, like a leaf or a bag of chips or something, that's enough if you have a high enough budget.

455
0:21:26,660 --> 0:21:29,560
 And that's back in the NSA government-level area.

456
0:21:30,940 --> 0:21:36,160
 Another optical attack, which I like to include, because this one was actually covered a lot back in 2019,

457
0:21:36,160 --> 0:21:40,460
 it was laser-based audio injection on voice-controllable systems.

458
0:21:41,040 --> 0:21:42,160
 So if you had a smart speaker...

459
0:21:43,060 --> 0:21:52,560
 And you placed it by your window, you could trigger the smart speaker with a laser by doing essentially the opposite of encoding your voice into the laser.

460
0:21:52,860 --> 0:21:58,060
 And by pointing it at the right place on the smart speaker, on specifically on what's called a MEMS microphone,

461
0:21:58,460 --> 0:22:06,060
 which, again, all these home assistant smart speakers have, you could inject the sound into it from kilometers away.

462
0:22:06,680 --> 0:22:12,220
 So imagine if you have a nice, fancy smart home, and you put this smart speaker in your window,

463
0:22:12,220 --> 0:22:12,840
 because it looks nice.

464
0:22:12,840 --> 0:22:13,740
 It looks nice in the window.

465
0:22:14,440 --> 0:22:18,640
 Then, as me, as a thief, I could point my laser at it, and I could say,

466
0:22:18,640 --> 0:22:20,640
 Hey, open the garage doors.

467
0:22:21,040 --> 0:22:22,340
 I have access to your house now.

468
0:22:24,340 --> 0:22:27,840
 There are also many, many other kinds of side-channel attacks.

469
0:22:28,440 --> 0:22:35,340
 Recently, there was the Satan attack, it's called, where they turned SATA cables into antennas,

470
0:22:36,240 --> 0:22:42,640
 and then they could get around air gap security by sending the right data, by encoding the data through the signals coming out of these antennas.

471
0:22:43,340 --> 0:22:48,340
 There's really no limits to what side-channel attacks can do, and there's so many of them.

472
0:22:48,940 --> 0:22:52,540
 And before people ask, yes, data exfiltration is still a side-channel attack.

473
0:22:52,540 --> 0:22:56,440
 You're still abusing this system in a way it wasn't supposed to, to gain information.

474
0:22:56,440 --> 0:23:00,340
 In this case, it's just to get information out, but you're still gaining information.

475
0:23:01,940 --> 0:23:03,940
 So what can we learn from all of this?

476
0:23:05,040 --> 0:23:11,640
 Systems are hard to implement, and if there's a design consideration, for example, stamping the gear mode serial number

477
0:23:11,640 --> 0:23:12,640
 onto a call, or a message, or something like that, it's not going to work.

478
0:23:12,640 --> 0:23:19,140
 If you have a call going to a tank so you can track down defects in production, it can be abused.

479
0:23:19,740 --> 0:23:24,840
 This can be if you send out any IDs from your web app, who knows what.

480
0:23:26,240 --> 0:23:29,640
 And for the love of God, use someone else's cryptographic libraries.

481
0:23:29,940 --> 0:23:32,940
 And this is what people mean when they say, don't roll your own crypto,

482
0:23:33,740 --> 0:23:40,740
 because other people's libraries have hopefully been tested for these kinds of side-channel attacks, and you can minimize it.

483
0:23:41,140 --> 0:23:42,440
 Because there's a lot of these attacks.

484
0:23:42,440 --> 0:23:49,740
 Like the timing attacks and power monitoring attacks that are quite easy to do, and it doesn't take more of an afternoon to learn how to do it.

485
0:23:51,840 --> 0:23:57,040
 If you want some further reading, I can highly recommend Silence of the Wire by Michael Zaleski.

486
0:23:58,040 --> 0:23:58,840
 Great book.

487
0:23:59,240 --> 0:24:01,940
 Talks in general just about side-channel attacks.

488
0:24:02,840 --> 0:24:04,640
 There's also Art of Intrusion by Kevin Mitnick.

489
0:24:05,440 --> 0:24:10,140
 Not so much about side-channel attacks, but does have a quite cool cryptographic attack on a

490
0:24:10,140 --> 0:24:11,640
 on a

491
0:24:12,440 --> 0:24:17,240
 slot machine in the casino they talk about, and how they could predict the random number generator.

492
0:24:18,340 --> 0:24:22,240
 And there's also A Cuckoo's Egg by Clifford Stahl, which is just a great book about hacking.

493
0:24:22,340 --> 0:24:24,040
 Not really too much about side-channel attacks in it.

494
0:24:26,140 --> 0:24:27,240
 Thank you for coming to my talk.

495
0:24:27,640 --> 0:24:30,340
 I'll be putting the slides up on my website at some point.

496
0:24:30,340 --> 0:24:32,440
 I just need to fix some attribution stuff a little bit there.

497
0:24:32,740 --> 0:24:37,240
 You want to follow me on untapped, because that's really the most important communication media.

498
0:24:37,740 --> 0:24:38,840
 You can follow me there.

499
0:24:38,940 --> 0:24:40,740
 And there's just a CTF flag.

500
0:24:40,740 --> 0:24:41,640
 Just ignore that.

501
0:24:41,640 --> 0:24:42,340
 It's going to be using like,

502
0:24:42,440 --> 0:24:43,440
 90 days or so.

503
0:24:45,740 --> 0:24:46,240
 Thank you.

504
0:24:57,640 --> 0:24:58,240
 Thanks.

505
0:24:58,640 --> 0:24:59,740
 Are there any questions?

506
0:25:03,740 --> 0:25:07,040
 What is the best way to introduce some noise to make this less effective?

507
0:25:08,140 --> 0:25:11,940
 Introduce some noise to make it less effective.

508
0:25:12,440 --> 0:25:14,140
 It depends on your threat model.

509
0:25:14,140 --> 0:25:15,940
 I mean, depends on what you're building.

510
0:25:15,940 --> 0:25:20,940
 Of course, starters don't use sequential IDs.

511
0:25:20,940 --> 0:25:23,240
 You can always guess those because we're sequential.

512
0:25:24,240 --> 0:25:31,140
 But again, if you are using some, say, we have a cryptographic system running on a processor, but you made your own.

513
0:25:31,440 --> 0:25:39,440
 This can be making sure that you have some background tasks running to make sure power usage is linear and you can record that.

514
0:25:39,540 --> 0:25:41,840
 You can make sure that you add just some.

515
0:25:41,840 --> 0:25:47,840
 Make sure the programmers run for X amount of seconds, at least, no matter how fast it runs to avoid timing attacks, stuff like that.

516
0:25:48,040 --> 0:25:51,840
 Again, it depends on your threat model and there are just so many attacks.

517
0:25:51,840 --> 0:25:54,940
 So you can't really add noise for every single thing.

518
0:25:54,940 --> 0:25:58,640
 You cannot fully protect yourself from side channel attacks.

519
0:25:58,740 --> 0:26:02,840
 You can't fully protect yourself from any kind of attack, really.

520
0:26:03,340 --> 0:26:08,940
 Security is always about knowing your risk and doing what you can to defeat that risk.

521
0:26:09,340 --> 0:26:11,540
 As we were talking, I was talking about the Tempest Room.

522
0:26:11,540 --> 0:26:21,040
 The rooms that they made, the rooms inside rooms, this was a large, extreme security measure, but it was just too inconvenient for users to use, so they left the doors open.

523
0:26:22,040 --> 0:26:25,040
 This is what we mean when we say security is a bit of a balance.

524
0:26:25,040 --> 0:26:32,040
 You can't just go all out and make an unhackable system because there's always a more dedicated hacker and there's always users you have to deal with.

525
0:26:37,040 --> 0:26:38,040
 No more questions?

526
0:26:38,040 --> 0:26:42,540
 No, in that case, thanks a lot.
