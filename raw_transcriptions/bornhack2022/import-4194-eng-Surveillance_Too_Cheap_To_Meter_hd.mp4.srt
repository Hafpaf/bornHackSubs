0:00:00,000 --> 0:00:02,000
 I

2
0:00:14,320 --> 0:00:16,880
 Would like to welcome our next speaker

3
0:00:17,700 --> 0:00:21,900
 This is Paul Henning camp who is going to give us a talk about

4
0:00:22,640 --> 0:00:27,180
 Surveillance too cheap to meter. Please give Paul Henning a big hand

5
0:00:30,000 --> 0:00:32,000
 Thank you

6
0:00:33,120 --> 0:00:35,560
 So how many here do not understand Danish

7
0:00:37,620 --> 0:00:39,620
 Okay, we'll do it in English

8
0:00:40,080 --> 0:00:43,100
 Some of the illustrations will be in Danish, but I'll explain what the show

9
0:00:44,580 --> 0:00:45,980
 so

10
0:00:45,980 --> 0:00:49,520
 Many years ago. We had a lot of fun about this t-shirt

11
0:00:52,360 --> 0:00:57,080
 And since then we realized that this may actually be correct

12
0:01:00,000 --> 0:01:05,920
 And we talked a lot about the political layer, but this year I want to look at their financial layer

13
0:01:06,720 --> 0:01:12,620
 Because we generally tend to ignore that and I think it's incredibly important for the surveillance

14
0:01:13,440 --> 0:01:14,820
 situation

15
0:01:14,820 --> 0:01:18,340
 So I'm going to rewind very very far back

16
0:01:19,560 --> 0:01:20,880
 in

17
0:01:20,880 --> 0:01:24,680
 1954 the chairman for the US Atomic Energy Commission

18
0:01:25,760 --> 0:01:29,620
 gives a speech for the National Association of Science writers

19
0:01:30,000 --> 0:01:31,620
 and

20
0:01:31,620 --> 0:01:33,620
 one of the things he says is that

21
0:01:34,940 --> 0:01:39,780
 We will probably soon have electrical energy too cheap to meter

22
0:01:43,820 --> 0:01:46,240
 That has become a problem for the atomic energy

23
0:01:49,460 --> 0:01:51,460
 Business ever since

24
0:01:51,920 --> 0:01:57,960
 People have been rubbing their nose in this statement. This is from the US Nuclear Regulation Agency

25
0:01:58,240 --> 0:01:59,840
 they have a

26
0:01:59,840 --> 0:02:03,900
 Frequently asked question to try to explain this thing

27
0:02:05,700 --> 0:02:09,420
 But he actually has a very precise and very good point

28
0:02:10,980 --> 0:02:15,080
 This is a cut from the Danish newspaper The Engineer from 1959

29
0:02:15,960 --> 0:02:19,380
 containing statistics about the Danish grid in

30
0:02:20,900 --> 0:02:22,900
 1958-59

31
0:02:25,320 --> 0:02:28,420
 They're seeing growth of 7% per year

32
0:02:29,840 --> 0:02:38,620
 But only a doubling over the last 10 year though, but if you take those numbers and you look out and say what will a

33
0:02:39,120 --> 0:02:43,800
 normal house use of electricity in 2020 you get a number between

34
0:02:44,440 --> 0:02:45,740
 45

35
0:02:45,740 --> 0:02:51,900
 Megawatt hours and 2.6. Megawatt hours. The reality is only 1.5

36
0:02:54,760 --> 0:02:59,320
 But if you were in the business of producing and selling electricity at that point

37
0:03:00,440 --> 0:03:02,440
 This scared the shit out of you

38
0:03:04,500 --> 0:03:06,620
 They looked at growth curves like this

39
0:03:07,620 --> 0:03:14,700
 This is a semi-locked scale. The y-axis is logarithmic. This is like, you know, COVID-19

40
0:03:16,280 --> 0:03:18,280
 Exponential functions

41
0:03:20,960 --> 0:03:24,400
 They also knew that the oil reserves were finite

42
0:03:25,400 --> 0:03:29,540
 There might be oil we haven't found yet, but at some point we'll have used all the oil

43
0:03:29,840 --> 0:03:34,780
 And if you look at a finite resource and exponential growth, it runs out really fast

44
0:03:36,520 --> 0:03:42,040
 So at this point the only technology available to them that would be able

45
0:03:44,240 --> 0:03:48,100
 To follow that curve, however far it would go would be nuclear power

46
0:03:49,280 --> 0:03:51,700
 It was the only energy that had sufficient density

47
0:03:52,600 --> 0:03:57,520
 That we wouldn't have to put down a coal-fired plant in every town throughout the West

48
0:03:58,460 --> 0:04:00,460
 So it was more or less

49
0:04:01,740 --> 0:04:10,400
 Totally assumed, given, beyond dispute that we will be building nuclear power plants because it's the only way to continue the curve

50
0:04:10,860 --> 0:04:12,800
 this is a

51
0:04:12,800 --> 0:04:15,520
 big spread from same engineers newspaper from

52
0:04:15,860 --> 0:04:20,140
 1966 where they say that they're starting to save up the money now to build the first plant in

53
0:04:20,480 --> 0:04:22,480
 1975 and it's not

54
0:04:22,740 --> 0:04:27,440
 It's not if they will it's when they will with an option of building it

55
0:04:27,440 --> 0:04:29,440
 A little bit earlier, maybe

56
0:04:30,040 --> 0:04:35,400
 There's no I mean yeah, there's some problems we need to deal with but there's absolutely no

57
0:04:35,980 --> 0:04:41,440
 Public debate at this point nuclear power is going to happen and that's going to happen and that's just going to happen

58
0:04:41,620 --> 0:04:43,620
 There's no choice

59
0:04:45,360 --> 0:04:48,740
 But nuclear power has a big problem you can't regulate it

60
0:04:50,080 --> 0:04:56,920
 The curve you have on your left side here is the Danish electricity use over a day in December in

61
0:04:57,640 --> 0:04:59,640
 1961 and

62
0:04:59,640 --> 0:05:05,400
 We have a very big peak in the morning and in the afternoon and it during lunch everybody

63
0:05:06,640 --> 0:05:08,640
 cools down or something

64
0:05:09,220 --> 0:05:11,100
 at this point

65
0:05:11,100 --> 0:05:13,940
 moving major users of electricity was

66
0:05:14,420 --> 0:05:19,360
 Unthinkable, we're back in thehsts everybody go on summer vacation in the same three weeks

67
0:05:22,020 --> 0:05:25,020
 The problem is you can't regulate a nuclear reactor

68
0:05:25,700 --> 0:05:26,800
 its physics

69
0:05:26,800 --> 0:05:28,920
 It's not something you get to debate.

70
0:05:28,920 --> 0:05:34,440
 The top curve shows the regulatory domain in Belgium today.

71
0:05:34,440 --> 0:05:41,580
 You can regulate a nuclear reactor 25% down for less than six hours, but then it has to

72
0:05:41,580 --> 0:05:46,420
 run continuously for three days at full power again before you're allowed to regulate it

73
0:05:46,420 --> 0:05:48,000
 down again.

74
0:05:48,000 --> 0:05:52,220
 And this is simply a matter of neutronics in the kernel.

75
0:05:52,220 --> 0:05:57,740
 The fundamental problem is that a nuclear reactor is a cylindrical device.

76
0:05:57,740 --> 0:06:03,840
 You have fuel rods going vertically down through it, but the nuclear reaction is a spherical

77
0:06:03,840 --> 0:06:11,040
 phenomena and the more power you have, you generate, the larger the sphere.

78
0:06:11,040 --> 0:06:15,700
 And that means if you, when you cut it, when you reduce the power production, you reduce

79
0:06:15,700 --> 0:06:21,320
 the radius of the square in the middle where you have sufficient neutronic density and

80
0:06:21,320 --> 0:06:22,200
 it gives all sorts of problems.

81
0:06:22,200 --> 0:06:31,440
 Both in terms of fusion results that eat neutrons, but also in terms of burning up spent fuel

82
0:06:31,440 --> 0:06:32,440
 and so on.

83
0:06:32,440 --> 0:06:37,440
 The bottom one, I'm not going to try to explain it, but it's basically regulating a nuclear

84
0:06:37,440 --> 0:06:42,080
 reactor is like sailing a supertanker in a very narrow strait.

85
0:06:42,080 --> 0:06:46,880
 Or maybe I should say containers, Shiva and Suez Canal.

86
0:06:46,880 --> 0:06:48,940
 You really don't want to try to wiggle around.

87
0:06:48,940 --> 0:06:51,720
 The small gray area here at the top is the normal fuel.

88
0:06:51,720 --> 0:06:54,160
 It's a normal frequency control area.

89
0:06:54,160 --> 0:07:00,640
 That's where you can run your nuclear reactor without any questions under normal circumstances.

90
0:07:00,640 --> 0:07:03,540
 So the question is, what do we do about all this electricity?

91
0:07:03,540 --> 0:07:07,000
 We'll have the nuclear reactors running up here and then we'll have a couple of peak

92
0:07:07,000 --> 0:07:09,040
 plants we'll use for the peaks.

93
0:07:09,040 --> 0:07:13,180
 But then we have all this electricity, what are we going to do with it?

94
0:07:13,180 --> 0:07:19,960
 I mean, we can stop the turbine and just have the heat go out into the air, into the water,

95
0:07:19,960 --> 0:07:20,960
 whatever.

96
0:07:20,960 --> 0:07:24,580
 If we let the turbine run, that's actually better for it, running constantly also.

97
0:07:24,580 --> 0:07:29,140
 So we have all this electricity.

98
0:07:29,140 --> 0:07:35,620
 So we have a situation, an economic outlook, where we will have power production that way

99
0:07:35,620 --> 0:07:44,440
 overshoots the average demand.

100
0:07:44,440 --> 0:07:50,040
 Too cheap to meter comes in because power meters are actually expensive.

101
0:07:50,040 --> 0:07:50,440
 You have to buy them.

102
0:07:50,960 --> 0:07:53,460
 You have to install them.

103
0:07:53,460 --> 0:07:55,280
 You have to read them.

104
0:07:55,280 --> 0:07:56,980
 You have to do the bookkeeping.

105
0:07:56,980 --> 0:07:59,960
 You have to handle the people who don't pay their bills.

106
0:07:59,960 --> 0:08:03,340
 You have to do statistical tests that they're still precise.

107
0:08:03,340 --> 0:08:06,080
 You have to calibrate them and so on.

108
0:08:06,080 --> 0:08:08,780
 It's actually a big business.

109
0:08:08,780 --> 0:08:15,480
 This is what bookkeeping looked like in the 1960s when we were looking at this.

110
0:08:15,480 --> 0:08:20,440
 Remember this is, computers are starting to get into it.

111
0:08:20,440 --> 0:08:25,440
 But it's very attractive to think things like, maybe if we remove the variable element

112
0:08:25,440 --> 0:08:30,020
 of people's electrical bill.

113
0:08:30,020 --> 0:08:34,800
 We don't have to do, we'll have four different kinds of electricity bills.

114
0:08:34,800 --> 0:08:38,440
 If you have one phase, if you have three phases, if you have a big fuse, if you have an even

115
0:08:38,440 --> 0:08:39,440
 bigger fuse.

116
0:08:39,440 --> 0:08:40,440
 Right?

117
0:08:40,440 --> 0:08:41,440
 We can have them pre-printed.

118
0:08:41,440 --> 0:08:45,320
 We just need to stamp the name and address and send them out.

119
0:08:45,320 --> 0:08:47,100
 It's much simpler.

120
0:08:47,100 --> 0:08:49,440
 We don't have to have people go out and read the meters.

121
0:08:49,440 --> 0:08:50,440
 Right?

122
0:08:50,440 --> 0:08:56,720
 We don't need to care about the calibration because there's no meter.

123
0:08:56,720 --> 0:09:07,780
 You'll be limited by the fuse, the top fuse going into your house, end of story.

124
0:09:07,780 --> 0:09:17,600
 So the place where this comes from is that we'll have these enormous fixed costs and

125
0:09:17,600 --> 0:09:19,440
 the variable cost will be marginal.

126
0:09:19,440 --> 0:09:25,720
 So there's no point in spending money metering the variable part.

127
0:09:25,720 --> 0:09:29,380
 Transpires, things didn't go that bad.

128
0:09:29,380 --> 0:09:36,200
 The curve kind of leveled off and we got taught an idea about oil back in 1973 and we've never

129
0:09:36,200 --> 0:09:37,900
 forgotten that again.

130
0:09:37,900 --> 0:09:44,360
 We never made ourselves dependent on fossil fuels from unstable regimes ever since.

131
0:09:44,360 --> 0:09:46,440
 Not a problem.

132
0:09:46,440 --> 0:09:47,560
 Solved.

133
0:09:47,560 --> 0:09:48,680
 Um.

134
0:09:48,680 --> 0:09:53,440
 And the idea that we could ditch the electricity meter was not something he was alone about.

135
0:09:53,440 --> 0:09:58,000
 This is an editorial from the same paper again.

136
0:09:58,000 --> 0:10:07,620
 Throw out these, just waste of money and administrative overhead, right?

137
0:10:07,620 --> 0:10:12,280
 This was literally how the electricity business thought at this time.

138
0:10:12,280 --> 0:10:15,960
 So back to the future.

139
0:10:15,960 --> 0:10:16,960
 So today the major fight on the Internet.

140
0:10:16,960 --> 0:10:17,960
 The major fight on the Internet.

141
0:10:17,960 --> 0:10:23,780
 The major fight on the Internet is for lower latency.

142
0:10:23,780 --> 0:10:27,320
 The first thing that happens whenever you go anywhere with a mobile phone is a DNS look

143
0:10:27,320 --> 0:10:29,960
 up.

144
0:10:29,960 --> 0:10:35,340
 And since DNS is very useful in tracking people, all the DNS records have very low TTLs.

145
0:10:35,340 --> 0:10:38,100
 They're not cacheable for very long.

146
0:10:38,100 --> 0:10:44,560
 In the ultimate case, you have one big company that basically has no TTL on the DNS records.

147
0:10:44,560 --> 0:10:47,840
 And then they fuck up the DNS server so nobody can reach them.

148
0:10:47,840 --> 0:10:51,820
 And it transpires their own systems cannot reach the DNS server either.

149
0:10:51,820 --> 0:10:57,440
 And since they have everything probably done on computers, they end up having to drive

150
0:10:57,440 --> 0:11:02,960
 three high-level managers down to a data center in the South Bay so that one of them can say

151
0:11:02,960 --> 0:11:06,720
 to the guard, which is his responsibility, that the next one is okay, and the next one

152
0:11:06,720 --> 0:11:10,220
 can say the third one is okay, and he can say this guy is allowed to go in and muck

153
0:11:10,220 --> 0:11:12,220
 with that router.

154
0:11:12,220 --> 0:11:15,840
 And I'm told it was not going any faster because somebody called, I don't know, Mark or something.

155
0:11:15,840 --> 0:11:16,840
 I don't know.

156
0:11:16,840 --> 0:11:17,840
 I don't know.

157
0:11:17,840 --> 0:11:18,840
 I don't know, Mark or something.

158
0:11:18,840 --> 0:11:22,400
 Kept calling everybody on the phone and yelling at them something about owning the company

159
0:11:22,400 --> 0:11:24,680
 and stuff, but nobody knew the phone number.

160
0:11:24,680 --> 0:11:29,920
 So, and I mean anybody can say that, right?

161
0:11:29,920 --> 0:11:37,460
 But, they have larger TTLs now, by the way.

162
0:11:37,460 --> 0:11:44,400
 The primary argument for HTTP 2 is to reuse the TCP connection we already have open so

163
0:11:44,400 --> 0:11:47,840
 that we don't have to have the three-way handshake before we get the first contact.

164
0:11:47,840 --> 0:11:55,060
 The primary argument for HTTP3 is we have a persistent session, so that even if our

165
0:11:55,060 --> 0:11:59,820
 mobile phone moves somewhere else, get a new IP number, we can get the first request with

166
0:11:59,820 --> 0:12:03,000
 a single packet to reduce the latency.

167
0:12:03,000 --> 0:12:07,420
 It's all about getting the latency down.

168
0:12:07,420 --> 0:12:10,060
 So why is that priority number one?

169
0:12:10,060 --> 0:12:16,720
 Because when you go into any well-monetized website, it throws around 50 to 100 HTTP requests

170
0:12:16,720 --> 0:12:19,180
 out.

171
0:12:19,180 --> 0:12:26,060
 Targeted advertising, the actual content may come at some point, third-party content, social

172
0:12:26,060 --> 0:12:31,220
 media tie-ins, analytics engagement, all this crap.

173
0:12:31,220 --> 0:12:32,460
 This is an example of it.

174
0:12:32,460 --> 0:12:38,160
 Some of it is in red because I run no script on my browser, so they don't get to start

175
0:12:38,160 --> 0:12:42,160
 the entire cascade.

176
0:12:42,160 --> 0:12:46,720
 Targeted advertising is a major part of this because to do targeted advertising, you have

177
0:12:46,720 --> 0:12:49,560
 to ask who wants to advertise here.

178
0:12:49,560 --> 0:12:57,140
 When you go into websites, there's an online, real-time auction going on about your attention.

179
0:12:57,140 --> 0:13:09,100
 It's run by Google and Facebook, but below them is an ecosystem of a couple of hundred

180
0:13:09,100 --> 0:13:16,220
 brokers who will bid in these real-time, very rapid auctions and say, oh, I have an advertisement,

181
0:13:16,220 --> 0:13:20,620
 I want to show this user, and so on.

182
0:13:20,620 --> 0:13:25,840
 Some of these brokers never win to show any advertising, which is kind of a funny thing.

183
0:13:25,840 --> 0:13:33,480
 They're just, you know, listening in on the traffic.

184
0:13:33,480 --> 0:13:38,220
 And this is basically why the mobile experience sucks.

185
0:13:38,220 --> 0:13:42,800
 All the crap they have to do to do the advertising on top of it.

186
0:13:42,800 --> 0:13:45,440
 But everybody blames their telco.

187
0:13:45,440 --> 0:13:53,260
 Not entirely unfairly, I would say, but the soggy experience is mainly blamed on telcos.

188
0:13:53,260 --> 0:13:57,880
 So telcos roll out a new network, 5G network, to improve things.

189
0:13:57,880 --> 0:14:01,320
 And this is their number one priority.

190
0:14:01,320 --> 0:14:06,620
 The fight for 5G, shorter response time, bigger bandwidth.

191
0:14:06,620 --> 0:14:08,320
 But the shorter response time is the big one.

192
0:14:08,320 --> 0:14:14,840
 The bandwidth is sort of a secondary thing, really.

193
0:14:14,840 --> 0:14:17,740
 And it's not been a secret.

194
0:14:17,740 --> 0:14:22,900
 5G were ready as far as everybody thought, until somebody came and said, we have to get

195
0:14:22,900 --> 0:14:25,480
 these latencies down.

196
0:14:25,480 --> 0:14:30,120
 That delayed 5G for about three years, the standardization process.

197
0:14:30,120 --> 0:14:36,320
 Getting latency down, getting latency down, getting latency down.

198
0:14:36,320 --> 0:14:39,920
 When you want a higher bandwidth, you need to use a higher radio frequency.

199
0:14:39,920 --> 0:14:42,300
 That means you have a shorter reach.

200
0:14:42,300 --> 0:14:44,660
 When we had the NMT, the first mobile telephone network.

201
0:14:44,660 --> 0:14:47,980
 Well, the second mobile telephone network in Denmark.

202
0:14:47,980 --> 0:14:51,680
 We had 28 base stations for all of Denmark.

203
0:14:51,680 --> 0:14:53,260
 That was all it took.

204
0:14:53,260 --> 0:14:56,640
 And you recovered sailing all the way to Sweden, too.

205
0:14:56,640 --> 0:15:02,760
 Then we got GSM, which under normal circumstances is limited to 35 kilometers.

206
0:15:02,760 --> 0:15:06,860
 You can do a trick with dual time slots, so you can double that, but then only have half

207
0:15:06,860 --> 0:15:09,600
 as many handsets and stuff.

208
0:15:09,600 --> 0:15:12,760
 LTE reduced it to 10 kilometers.

209
0:15:12,760 --> 0:15:14,080
 5G.

210
0:15:14,080 --> 0:15:22,680
 In many instances, reduces it to 100 meters in high population areas.

211
0:15:22,680 --> 0:15:28,500
 This also means now they know where you are equally precisely.

212
0:15:28,500 --> 0:15:34,260
 With GSM and LTE, they're new within 100 meters, a radius of 100 meters on certainty, circular

213
0:15:34,260 --> 0:15:35,940
 error probability.

214
0:15:35,940 --> 0:15:41,540
 With 5G, they will know where you are within a few meters.

215
0:15:41,540 --> 0:15:44,080
 This means they will know what ice cream shop you are.

216
0:15:44,080 --> 0:15:46,640
 They will know where you went into, if there are two.

217
0:15:46,640 --> 0:15:55,120
 They can tell whether you went to Burger King or McDonald's, even when they're next door.

218
0:15:55,120 --> 0:15:56,600
 But this is purely a side effect.

219
0:15:56,600 --> 0:15:58,420
 That's not why they built the network.

220
0:15:58,420 --> 0:16:03,780
 But it comes out of building the network.

221
0:16:03,780 --> 0:16:10,520
 And these data pours out of the network constantly, because the network needs these informations

222
0:16:10,520 --> 0:16:11,520
 to work.

223
0:16:11,520 --> 0:16:12,680
 You cannot get the 5G network to move.

224
0:16:12,680 --> 0:16:13,680
 You cannot get the 5G network to move.

225
0:16:13,680 --> 0:16:13,920
 You cannot get the 5G network to move.

226
0:16:13,920 --> 0:16:14,040
 You cannot get the 5G network to move.

227
0:16:14,040 --> 0:16:19,320
 You cannot move the data if it doesn't know where you are, which antennas and so on.

228
0:16:19,320 --> 0:16:30,200
 And historically, telcos have been data dependent.

229
0:16:30,200 --> 0:16:35,880
 They were almost paranoid about call data records, because they would have to go to

230
0:16:35,880 --> 0:16:41,700
 court with customers who said, I never called this number of this sex line you claim I called.

231
0:16:41,700 --> 0:16:43,880
 They'd have to drag them into court, show here's the call data.

232
0:16:43,880 --> 0:16:45,120
 They'd have to drag them into court, show here's the call data record from this switch,

233
0:16:45,120 --> 0:16:46,120
 this switch, this switch.

234
0:16:46,120 --> 0:16:50,560
 We can show you made this telcom call.

235
0:16:50,560 --> 0:16:51,560
 It's valuable data.

236
0:16:51,560 --> 0:16:54,500
 It used to be valuable data.

237
0:16:54,500 --> 0:16:59,660
 And there's this little build over, you know, how many people called their grandmother on

238
0:16:59,660 --> 0:17:01,760
 Christmas Eve to say Merry Christmas.

239
0:17:01,760 --> 0:17:03,700
 That was a very big thing in the US.

240
0:17:03,700 --> 0:17:09,880
 And how many people went to the Justin Bieber concert or Roskilde Festival or Black Friday

241
0:17:09,880 --> 0:17:13,720
 and City 2 and so on.

242
0:17:13,720 --> 0:17:19,720
 Customers don't complain about phone bills anymore because they're flat rate.

243
0:17:19,720 --> 0:17:28,600
 It transpired that the volume of traffic made teletraffic too cheap to meter.

244
0:17:28,600 --> 0:17:31,240
 All this paperwork was too expensive.

245
0:17:31,240 --> 0:17:38,420
 And I can semi-happily, unhappily say that I was there when it happened in Denmark, when

246
0:17:38,420 --> 0:17:43,640
 Cyber City introduced flat rate internet access.

247
0:17:43,640 --> 0:17:48,020
 Because it was simply cheaper for us to give people a fixed price than to do all the paperwork

248
0:17:48,020 --> 0:17:53,020
 and print all the lines about what they had used and when they had used it.

249
0:17:53,020 --> 0:17:56,880
 So today telecommunications is flat rate.

250
0:17:56,880 --> 0:18:02,140
 When people complain it's because they've been sucked up by some cruise ship or other

251
0:18:02,140 --> 0:18:08,640
 predatory network, which is now illegally used so that shouldn't happen anymore.

252
0:18:08,640 --> 0:18:11,640
 So the entire go to court thing with the data is gone.

253
0:18:11,640 --> 0:18:12,640
 It's gone.

254
0:18:12,640 --> 0:18:13,640
 It's gone.

255
0:18:13,640 --> 0:18:14,640
 It's gone.

256
0:18:14,640 --> 0:18:15,640
 It's gone.

257
0:18:15,640 --> 0:18:16,640
 It's gone.

258
0:18:16,640 --> 0:18:21,140
 So why don't the telcos stop?

259
0:18:21,140 --> 0:18:25,220
 Well they need to change the equipment to stop it.

260
0:18:25,220 --> 0:18:27,140
 They can't change it from the operational network.

261
0:18:27,140 --> 0:18:30,440
 It will pour out of the operational network whatever happens.

262
0:18:30,440 --> 0:18:33,120
 But they could stop collecting it, couldn't they?

263
0:18:33,120 --> 0:18:37,120
 Yes, except there may be a court order on some of it.

264
0:18:37,120 --> 0:18:40,300
 So they still have to record that.

265
0:18:40,300 --> 0:18:43,020
 And they may be doing technical experiments.

266
0:18:43,020 --> 0:18:46,520
 Experiments of their own to find out where to put up new base stations.

267
0:18:46,520 --> 0:18:48,720
 So they also have to keep that data.

268
0:18:48,720 --> 0:18:53,060
 And there's probably more special cases than that that I don't know about.

269
0:18:53,060 --> 0:18:54,120
 And then there's politics.

270
0:18:54,120 --> 0:18:55,880
 But we're at layer eight.

271
0:18:55,880 --> 0:18:58,840
 We're not doing the politics so we'll skip that one today.

272
0:18:58,840 --> 0:19:06,820
 And recently there was a bit of news about the New Day which is basically TDC, the incumbent

273
0:19:06,820 --> 0:19:08,300
 telco in Denmark.

274
0:19:08,300 --> 0:19:12,020
 They're going to spend a billion kroner on a new back office system.

275
0:19:12,020 --> 0:19:15,600
 They had the same news about ten years ago.

276
0:19:15,600 --> 0:19:19,180
 They gave it up back then.

277
0:19:19,180 --> 0:19:20,840
 This is expensive stuff.

278
0:19:20,840 --> 0:19:26,380
 They will have to pay money to stop the collection of the data.

279
0:19:26,380 --> 0:19:30,780
 Nobody pays them to say stop, please stop monitoring everybody in Denmark.

280
0:19:30,780 --> 0:19:33,440
 There would be money out of the telcos pocket to stop it.

281
0:19:33,440 --> 0:19:36,140
 It's cheaper for them to continue because they have it in place.

282
0:19:36,140 --> 0:19:40,140
 It's running.

283
0:19:42,020 --> 0:19:46,780
 I seem to have moved the slide around now.

284
0:19:46,780 --> 0:19:47,780
 Oh, yeah.

285
0:19:47,780 --> 0:19:50,340
 No, that's the second part.

286
0:19:50,340 --> 0:19:58,520
 The other part of the 5G network is the communication with big numbers of Internet of Things units.

287
0:19:58,520 --> 0:20:00,780
 This is also a big one.

288
0:20:00,780 --> 0:20:06,020
 So we're seeing more and more consumer items getting over the air upgrades.

289
0:20:06,020 --> 0:20:10,800
 There was an interesting case recently where the AEG.

290
0:20:10,800 --> 0:20:11,800
 AEG.

291
0:20:12,020 --> 0:20:18,900
 Did a software update on an Internet-connected microwave oven and gave it the wrong file.

292
0:20:18,900 --> 0:20:21,940
 So it thought it was a steam oven.

293
0:20:21,940 --> 0:20:27,660
 And the steam oven or the microwave oven doesn't have the keys you use on the steam oven to

294
0:20:27,660 --> 0:20:31,060
 get into the software updates menu.

295
0:20:31,060 --> 0:20:34,300
 So they have to send a technician out and do the...

296
0:20:34,300 --> 0:20:37,260
 And turn it back.

297
0:20:37,260 --> 0:20:38,780
 But we're seeing increasingly that...

298
0:20:38,780 --> 0:20:39,780
 I'm sorry.

299
0:20:39,780 --> 0:20:40,780
 Sorry.

300
0:20:40,780 --> 0:20:41,780
 Sorry.

301
0:20:41,780 --> 0:20:42,540
 Sorry.

302
0:20:42,540 --> 0:20:44,540
 I mean, there is a built-in SIM card.

303
0:20:44,540 --> 0:20:50,340
 There is a built-in Internet connection to download all the air updates without the consumer

304
0:20:50,340 --> 0:20:53,220
 being involved.

305
0:20:53,220 --> 0:20:56,960
 The vendor gets a volume agreement with a Telco.

306
0:20:56,960 --> 0:21:00,680
 We need a hell of a lot of SIM cards.

307
0:21:00,680 --> 0:21:04,240
 They will be in one place, they will never move.

308
0:21:04,240 --> 0:21:08,840
 Well, maybe once or twice in ten years.

309
0:21:08,840 --> 0:21:11,660
 But they're not going to run around, never going to run to big events.

310
0:21:11,660 --> 0:21:19,500
 events, they're not going to bother you. There will normally be no traffic on them. And we

311
0:21:19,500 --> 0:21:23,940
 can schedule burst traffic. When we do a software update, we can call you and say, when is a

312
0:21:23,940 --> 0:21:32,300
 good time for you? So, the telco can give very good rates on this. You would be amazed

313
0:21:32,300 --> 0:21:39,220
 how cheaply you can get a SIM card when you call up with conditions like this. My lawnmower

314
0:21:39,220 --> 0:21:50,340
 robots come with a SIM card. I've never paid a thing for it. Because, volume, high-end

315
0:21:50,340 --> 0:22:02,100
 cars, high-end white goods, built-in SIM cards these days. The legal business case for this

316
0:22:02,100 --> 0:22:06,920
 or the moral business case for this is that you won't have any trouble with customers

317
0:22:06,920 --> 0:22:08,920
 who cannot figure out to attach their...

318
0:22:09,220 --> 0:22:14,760
 dishwasher to their Wi-Fi. You also won't have troubles with the ones who don't want

319
0:22:14,760 --> 0:22:21,520
 to attach it to their Wi-Fi. You can tell very precisely when the warranty period starts.

320
0:22:21,520 --> 0:22:29,660
 You can tell exactly when it was used first time. You can know if it has been misused,

321
0:22:29,660 --> 0:22:34,840
 if it's been overloaded, if it was not installed level, if it was not... all these things.

322
0:22:34,840 --> 0:22:39,180
 If it was outside temperature limits, lower voltage, higher voltage, all these things.

323
0:22:39,180 --> 0:22:51,320
 You know that now. So, you can reduce fraud from almost nothing to nothing, right? Whether

324
0:22:51,320 --> 0:22:56,560
 that's a good investment of money, well, that's the interesting thing, right? You also get

325
0:22:56,560 --> 0:23:01,600
 telemetry for optimizing your product, so that the next model will last exactly the

326
0:23:01,600 --> 0:23:06,140
 warranty period plus two weeks. That's legal.

327
0:23:09,180 --> 0:23:15,660
 The shady business case is that once you have the new model on the market, you can

328
0:23:15,660 --> 0:23:24,560
 handicap the old one. Nobody would ever do that with a mobile phone, I'm sure, right?

329
0:23:24,560 --> 0:23:32,840
 I have credible information that something happens to high-end cars of certain brand

330
0:23:32,840 --> 0:23:38,840
 when the new model is out. From somebody who's pretty upset about something happening to

331
0:23:38,840 --> 0:23:50,520
 his car. Whether that's legal is a very good question. You can also brick the product

332
0:23:50,520 --> 0:23:57,840
 if somebody attempts to do third-party unauthorized service on it, or tries to drive the tractor

333
0:23:57,840 --> 0:24:08,840
 from Ukraine to Russia. And then there's the outside business case. The data is not going

334
0:24:08,840 --> 0:24:14,180
 anywhere. The data you collected, whether they are GDPR or not, we can discuss that,

335
0:24:14,180 --> 0:24:26,460
 unauthorized access. I will argue that certainly GDPR data, but most data should be, we should

336
0:24:26,460 --> 0:24:33,300
 think about it as helium. Whenever you have some physics experiment that need to be vacuum

337
0:24:33,300 --> 0:24:38,320
 tight, you try with helium, because helium will get through anywhere. It's a very tiny

338
0:24:38,320 --> 0:24:38,820
 atom. It's a very tiny atom. It's a very tiny atom. It's a very tiny atom. It's a very

339
0:24:38,820 --> 0:24:39,820
 tiny atom. It's a very tiny atom. It's a very tiny atom. It's a very tiny atom. It's

340
0:24:39,820 --> 0:24:44,920
 not electrical charged. If there's any kind of hole, it will leak. And it seems that

341
0:24:44,920 --> 0:24:51,560
 personal data is the same kind of thing. Nobody seems to be able to keep a lid on them.

342
0:24:51,560 --> 0:24:57,960
 They leak out, one way or another. We have police officers looking up potential girlfriends

343
0:24:57,960 --> 0:25:06,340
 still, after I think four or five of them have been fined for it. It still happens.

344
0:25:06,340 --> 0:25:08,300
 It's just impossible to keep it tight.

345
0:25:08,300 --> 0:25:13,280
 And that means if you're a vendor of something and you collected all this information, if

346
0:25:13,280 --> 0:25:18,120
 there's any way to exploit it, it probably will be. If nothing else, when your company

347
0:25:18,120 --> 0:25:29,420
 gets ransomwared, we'll break all your customers' dishwashers. Christmas morning. If you don't

348
0:25:29,420 --> 0:25:38,040
 pay us. Right? And then we have the downright trivial with baby monitors being connected

349
0:25:38,040 --> 0:25:46,720
 to pedophile networks because apparently a lot of scantily clad women appear on baby

350
0:25:46,720 --> 0:25:58,320
 monitor cameras. Who saw that one coming? But the general problem is all this surveillance

351
0:25:58,320 --> 0:26:07,000
 is too cheap to meter now. The benefits of putting a SIM card in your high-end product,

352
0:26:08,040 --> 0:26:20,440
 the fact that you can't do anything about it remotely, outweighs the disadvantages of

353
0:26:20,440 --> 0:26:26,140
 all the shit data you collect on the cars as a result of it.

354
0:26:26,140 --> 0:26:29,960
 The telcos probably don't want to be in the surveillance business, but it would be more

355
0:26:29,960 --> 0:26:37,320
 expensive for them not to be. But we're seeing this go into more and more products. Televisions

356
0:26:37,320 --> 0:26:44,920
 with cameras, so they can sell audience data back to advertising networks. How many people

357
0:26:44,920 --> 0:26:55,540
 watch this ad? How many people watch this show? This is not a problem we can solve technically.

358
0:26:55,540 --> 0:26:59,680
 I know some people are very enthusiastic about slapping encryption on everywhere, but this

359
0:26:59,680 --> 0:27:05,660
 is not going to do shit for it. Problems at layer N can only be solved at layer N plus

360
0:27:05,660 --> 0:27:06,780
 one and higher.

361
0:27:07,320 --> 0:27:08,900
 all those fucking layers to begin with.

362
0:27:09,300 --> 0:27:11,240
 So these problems are something that will have

363
0:27:11,240 --> 0:27:12,300
 to be solved politically.

364
0:27:14,300 --> 0:27:15,320
 We cannot solve

365
0:27:15,320 --> 0:27:17,280
 them economically. They are economic problems.

366
0:27:17,400 --> 0:27:18,540
 They have to be solved politically.

367
0:27:21,480 --> 0:27:23,240
 What we'll probably see is

368
0:27:23,240 --> 0:27:25,420
 that you can get high-end models and you can pay

369
0:27:25,420 --> 0:27:27,200
 a surcharge for privacy.

370
0:27:28,260 --> 0:27:29,200
 Privacy has always

371
0:27:29,200 --> 0:27:30,480
 been a luxury good.

372
0:27:33,560 --> 0:27:34,900
 The way you avoid

373
0:27:34,900 --> 0:27:37,060
 having your credit card transactions

374
0:27:37,060 --> 0:27:39,180
 tracked is you don't

375
0:27:39,180 --> 0:27:41,240
 have a credit card. You have people

376
0:27:41,240 --> 0:27:42,960
 to have credit cards for you.

377
0:27:48,220 --> 0:27:49,160
 When some

378
0:27:49,160 --> 0:27:51,400
 crazy expensive yacht

379
0:27:51,400 --> 0:27:52,920
 lands in a harbour,

380
0:27:54,340 --> 0:27:55,000
 it is not

381
0:27:55,000 --> 0:27:57,160
 some Russian rich

382
0:27:57,160 --> 0:27:59,140
 asshole who goes down to show his

383
0:27:59,140 --> 0:28:01,120
 passport. It's the first

384
0:28:01,120 --> 0:28:03,200
 mate who comes down with a bunch of passports,

385
0:28:03,680 --> 0:28:05,060
 shows them to customs and then

386
0:28:05,060 --> 0:28:06,740
 clears everybody on the ship.

387
0:28:06,740 --> 0:28:07,020
 Customs.

388
0:28:07,060 --> 0:28:09,060
 Customs don't go aboard the ship to see if those

389
0:28:09,060 --> 0:28:10,060
 are the people on the ship.

390
0:28:10,620 --> 0:28:12,800
 They just see a pile of passports, stamp them

391
0:28:12,800 --> 0:28:13,640
 and everything's okay.

392
0:28:15,000 --> 0:28:16,100
 Privacy is a money thing.

393
0:28:16,640 --> 0:28:19,000
 I think we'll see that. I think we'll see

394
0:28:19,000 --> 0:28:20,800
 that you can buy your new

395
0:28:20,800 --> 0:28:22,940
 sports car and then do you

396
0:28:22,940 --> 0:28:24,620
 want the privacy option or do you want the

397
0:28:24,620 --> 0:28:26,140
 real-time service option?

398
0:28:28,980 --> 0:28:30,820
 We can probably also get to cases

399
0:28:30,820 --> 0:28:32,880
 where you buy a new television and

400
0:28:32,880 --> 0:28:35,000
 then you'll either have to sign up

401
0:28:35,000 --> 0:28:36,760
 for all the advertising and log in

402
0:28:37,060 --> 0:28:39,460
 to get the account and the network and all that crap.

403
0:28:39,460 --> 0:28:42,460
 Or you'll have to buy a subscription so you don't have to.

404
0:28:45,720 --> 0:28:49,300
 Or you'll have to do like people like us,

405
0:28:49,300 --> 0:28:50,560
 spend the time and money to

406
0:28:50,560 --> 0:28:54,160
 lobotomise the surveillance to get rid of it.

407
0:28:57,920 --> 0:29:00,820
 If we look at the possible political solutions,

408
0:29:00,820 --> 0:29:04,480
 one would simply be to tax transmission

409
0:29:04,480 --> 0:29:05,620
 of surveillance data.

410
0:29:07,060 --> 0:29:08,380
 Tax telemetry.

411
0:29:09,500 --> 0:29:11,280
 We can tax everything else

412
0:29:11,280 --> 0:29:12,800
 so we can also tax telemetry.

413
0:29:13,980 --> 0:29:14,800
 So that

414
0:29:14,800 --> 0:29:16,580
 it becomes a more

415
0:29:16,580 --> 0:29:19,140
 balanced business case.

416
0:29:19,620 --> 0:29:20,580
 So it's not for free.

417
0:29:21,360 --> 0:29:23,160
 So that maybe you shouldn't meter it

418
0:29:23,160 --> 0:29:24,920
 because you'll be paying tax on it.

419
0:29:26,640 --> 0:29:27,940
 We could tax

420
0:29:27,940 --> 0:29:29,700
 person data.

421
0:29:31,080 --> 0:29:33,760
 I think that's a very good idea.

422
0:29:33,760 --> 0:29:35,760
 Have an exponential

423
0:29:35,760 --> 0:29:38,200
 exponential scale that says

424
0:29:38,200 --> 0:29:40,740
 if you have data about 10 people

425
0:29:40,740 --> 0:29:43,040
 because you have an association of whatever,

426
0:29:44,620 --> 0:29:46,660
 you pay one crown a year.

427
0:29:46,660 --> 0:29:48,620
 If you have 100 people,

428
0:29:48,620 --> 0:29:50,300
 you pay 100 crown a year.

429
0:29:50,300 --> 0:29:53,020
 If 1,000 people, you pay 10,000 crown a year.

430
0:29:54,280 --> 0:29:57,800
 Let it go up with a square of the number of persons involved.

431
0:29:59,700 --> 0:30:02,220
 To make people think about there being a cost

432
0:30:02,220 --> 0:30:04,200
 to collecting all these data in the same place.

433
0:30:04,200 --> 0:30:05,240
 The same way where there's a cost of collecting data,

434
0:30:05,240 --> 0:30:07,780
 there's a cost of collecting dangerous chemicals

435
0:30:07,780 --> 0:30:10,500
 or explosives or anything else in big piles, right?

436
0:30:12,540 --> 0:30:13,920
 Or we could ban things.

437
0:30:15,640 --> 0:30:17,220
 A lot of things are banned.

438
0:30:17,220 --> 0:30:18,720
 A lot of things could be banned.

439
0:30:19,900 --> 0:30:23,260
 We could simply ban collecting any data

440
0:30:24,180 --> 0:30:26,800
 that can be used for tracking purposes.

441
0:30:28,180 --> 0:30:30,940
 Unless there is a approved application

442
0:30:30,940 --> 0:30:33,380
 with the Ministry of Privacy or whatever.

443
0:30:34,300 --> 0:30:34,980
 There's many ways that could be banned.

444
0:30:34,980 --> 0:30:36,640
 There's many ways that could be structured.

445
0:30:36,640 --> 0:30:39,140
 But there are political things that could be done

446
0:30:40,780 --> 0:30:43,240
 to turn this economic situation around.

447
0:30:44,420 --> 0:30:47,600
 And they will have to be done if we want to turn it around.

448
0:30:47,600 --> 0:30:49,660
 As long as this is purely an economic issue

449
0:30:49,660 --> 0:30:51,280
 for the people in layer eight,

450
0:30:52,240 --> 0:30:54,820
 surveillance is too cheap to meet it.

451
0:30:54,820 --> 0:30:56,360
 Of course, the problem is that

452
0:30:56,360 --> 0:30:58,600
 the politically possible solutions,

453
0:30:58,600 --> 0:31:00,640
 that's basically an empty sheet.

454
0:31:00,640 --> 0:31:02,140
 Nobody at the political layer

455
0:31:02,140 --> 0:31:04,540
 are willing to even talk about this at this point.

456
0:31:04,980 --> 0:31:07,420
 There are things coming out of EU,

457
0:31:07,420 --> 0:31:10,840
 but they're not addressing the economics of the situation.

458
0:31:10,840 --> 0:31:12,540
 They're addressing it on the,

459
0:31:12,540 --> 0:31:15,400
 should we say, ideal level of privacy.

460
0:31:15,400 --> 0:31:18,440
 But never looked into saying whether the economics

461
0:31:18,440 --> 0:31:20,640
 of the situation should actually be addressed.

462
0:31:23,420 --> 0:31:26,380
 That's a way we as nerds are not used to think.

463
0:31:26,380 --> 0:31:28,060
 And it was a bit of an eye opener for me

464
0:31:28,060 --> 0:31:29,980
 when I started to think about it in these terms.

465
0:31:29,980 --> 0:31:32,740
 So I hope I've shared my problem with users,

466
0:31:32,740 --> 0:31:34,340
 not just my worry anymore.

467
0:31:34,980 --> 0:31:36,580
 Okay, thank you.

468
0:31:39,020 --> 0:31:39,840
 Questions?

469
0:31:44,380 --> 0:31:45,220
 If there are any.

470
0:31:48,280 --> 0:31:49,320
 Any questions?

471
0:31:51,600 --> 0:31:53,100
 You won't have to pay for them.

472
0:31:55,360 --> 0:31:56,840
 No, no questions?

473
0:31:56,840 --> 0:31:57,680
 Really?

474
0:31:57,680 --> 0:31:58,520
 Then, really?

475
0:31:58,520 --> 0:31:59,340
 No questions?

476
0:31:59,340 --> 0:32:00,940
 Oh, that was a question, good.

477
0:32:04,980 --> 0:32:13,220
 so you mentioned data retention basically earlier so the the system of billing uh on sim cards on

478
0:32:13,220 --> 0:32:18,700
 mobile phone data and the fact that yeah up until now we've been we've basically been keeping track

479
0:32:18,700 --> 0:32:23,760
 of the calls of the use of data etc and that because of flat rates that's no longer necessary

480
0:32:23,760 --> 0:32:29,700
 um how does this so i i'm if i remember correctly there was a ruling by the european court of

481
0:32:29,700 --> 0:32:35,460
 justice precisely on the question of of retention of telephone records saying that telephone

482
0:32:35,460 --> 0:32:42,780
 companies were only allowed to retain them for the purposes of uh billing so what does that say now

483
0:32:42,780 --> 0:32:48,880
 should it really be the case today that uh the danish telecoms operators are still retaining

484
0:32:48,880 --> 0:32:52,640
 that information if it's no longer necessary for billing that's kind of my question but maybe i

485
0:32:52,640 --> 0:32:58,480
 missed it so so so that's basically a political question right

486
0:32:58,480 --> 0:32:59,680
 um

487
0:33:00,480 --> 0:33:06,680
 and i've skipped that in this talk but but basically there's an economic thing about making

488
0:33:06,680 --> 0:33:12,820
 criminal investigations cheaper also right if you can just look up where the potential

489
0:33:12,820 --> 0:33:21,100
 criminals were that's a lot cheaper in police work so there's a political pressure also on some of

490
0:33:21,100 --> 0:33:28,160
 this surveillance but so far we have not had the danish parliament try to get data from

491
0:33:28,160 --> 0:33:29,680
 dishwasher many times

492
0:33:29,700 --> 0:33:31,680
 CDаешь

493
0:33:31,680 --> 0:33:32,920
 um

494
0:33:34,720 --> 0:33:40,040
 we want a criminal justice system to be able to work and there's some checks and

495
0:33:40,040 --> 0:33:47,680
 balances that need to work and and that's the political uh struggle to get that right but um

496
0:33:50,320 --> 0:33:56,080
 without that there's no doubt that the eu justices basically said you have to leave

497
0:33:56,080 --> 0:33:59,480
 your data once you've done the statistics i mean the telco is still here when the telco is being used

498
0:33:59,480 --> 0:34:02,600
 still has a right to do, say, how much traffic

499
0:34:02,600 --> 0:34:04,480
 do we have Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and so on

500
0:34:04,480 --> 0:34:06,800
 at a statistical level.

501
0:34:06,900 --> 0:34:09,960
 But tracking at the individual level, no.

502
0:34:10,460 --> 0:34:12,180
 That's clearly out without one.

503
0:34:12,360 --> 0:34:15,420
 But in that case, the politics have trumped it

504
0:34:15,420 --> 0:34:20,700
 on interesting and pretty rocky ground in Denmark.

505
0:34:22,620 --> 0:34:26,100
 But that's a battle on the layer one level up, right?

506
0:34:29,480 --> 0:34:36,260
 It's a little bit difficult to come with questions

507
0:34:36,260 --> 0:34:38,280
 after such an excellent talk, so I think that's why

508
0:34:38,280 --> 0:34:39,660
 the audience is a little bit silent.

509
0:34:40,260 --> 0:34:42,080
 And I'm going to start with some stupid questions.

510
0:34:43,920 --> 0:34:46,380
 A lot of the surveillance that you're talking about

511
0:34:46,380 --> 0:34:47,640
 is at the individual level.

512
0:34:48,060 --> 0:34:50,900
 But a lot of the data that the Internet of Things

513
0:34:50,900 --> 0:34:53,560
 and the companies will say that they're looking for

514
0:34:53,560 --> 0:34:55,180
 is on the non-personal level.

515
0:34:55,840 --> 0:34:58,560
 When we're looking at the proposals on, for example,

516
0:34:58,680 --> 0:34:59,380
 a data rack,

517
0:34:59,480 --> 0:35:04,540
 and sort of sharing data also across companies

518
0:35:04,540 --> 0:35:07,800
 and countries within the EU, having these data lakes,

519
0:35:08,200 --> 0:35:10,600
 how do we, at the political level,

520
0:35:11,240 --> 0:35:15,880
 make sure that we protect against having surveillance

521
0:35:15,880 --> 0:35:20,320
 built into our washing machines and our cars and our phones

522
0:35:20,320 --> 0:35:23,240
 while at the same time making sure that we can have

523
0:35:23,240 --> 0:35:24,860
 the best use of them possible?

524
0:35:26,120 --> 0:35:27,580
 Tax the shit out of it.

525
0:35:29,000 --> 0:35:29,440
 No.

526
0:35:29,480 --> 0:35:31,060
 I mean it literally.

527
0:35:31,060 --> 0:35:33,320
 Taxing can be used to raise revenue,

528
0:35:33,320 --> 0:35:35,020
 and it can be used to regulate behavior.

529
0:35:36,640 --> 0:35:42,900
 And tax SIM cards with no other purpose

530
0:35:42,900 --> 0:35:45,120
 than spying on people and things.

531
0:35:45,900 --> 0:35:51,240
 Why shouldn't it cost, I don't know, 100 euros a year?

532
0:35:52,780 --> 0:35:56,900
 I mean, the numbers of a discussion and calculations

533
0:35:56,900 --> 0:35:59,440
 and spreadsheets and so on, but there's

534
0:35:59,440 --> 0:36:03,720
 been a total unwillingness to tax anything related

535
0:36:03,720 --> 0:36:06,500
 to the internet so far because, oh, we shouldn't stop

536
0:36:06,500 --> 0:36:07,640
 the next Bill Gates, right?

537
0:36:08,460 --> 0:36:09,880
 I happen to disagree on that one.

538
0:36:11,680 --> 0:36:16,580
 But it's time for politicians to realize that this is now

539
0:36:16,580 --> 0:36:20,520
 not something adjunct to society.

540
0:36:20,700 --> 0:36:22,860
 This is an integral part of society.

541
0:36:23,500 --> 0:36:26,320
 And it needs to work with and in society.

542
0:36:26,820 --> 0:36:29,420
 And it needs to be regulated to work in society.

543
0:36:29,440 --> 0:36:33,860
 And I think, I don't understand why collections

544
0:36:33,860 --> 0:36:37,120
 of personal identifiable information is not taxed

545
0:36:37,120 --> 0:36:41,680
 at this point, simply as a way to reduce the accumulation

546
0:36:41,680 --> 0:36:43,140
 of it in larger and larger piles.

547
0:36:43,140 --> 0:36:47,460
 And the fact that it would bankrupt Google and Facebook,

548
0:36:47,460 --> 0:36:48,820
 I don't see that as a negative.

549
0:36:48,820 --> 0:36:49,860
 There's a question?

550
0:36:49,860 --> 0:36:50,320
 Yes.

551
0:36:50,320 --> 0:36:50,820
 Yes.

552
0:36:50,820 --> 0:36:51,320
 Yes.

553
0:36:51,320 --> 0:36:51,820
 Yes.

554
0:36:51,820 --> 0:36:52,320
 Yes.

555
0:36:52,320 --> 0:36:52,820
 Yes.

556
0:36:52,820 --> 0:36:53,320
 Yes.

557
0:36:53,320 --> 0:36:53,820
 Yes.

558
0:36:53,820 --> 0:36:54,320
 Yes.

559
0:36:54,320 --> 0:36:54,820
 Yes.

560
0:36:54,820 --> 0:36:55,320
 Yes.

561
0:36:55,320 --> 0:36:55,820
 Yes.

562
0:36:55,820 --> 0:36:56,320
 Yes.

563
0:36:56,320 --> 0:36:56,820
 Yes.

564
0:36:56,820 --> 0:36:57,320
 Yes.

565
0:36:57,320 --> 0:36:57,820
 Yes.

566
0:36:57,820 --> 0:36:58,320
 Yes.

567
0:36:58,320 --> 0:36:58,820
 Yes.

568
0:36:58,820 --> 0:36:59,320
 Yes.

569
0:36:59,320 --> 0:36:59,400
 Yes.

570
0:36:59,400 --> 0:36:59,420
 Yes.

571
0:36:59,420 --> 0:37:00,080
 Oh there's another person behind you.

572
0:37:03,300 --> 0:37:06,400
 Hey, I wanted to mention that start them brief,

573
0:37:06,400 --> 0:37:10,680
 the data letter, that's kind of an idea from the

574
0:37:10,680 --> 0:37:13,780
 key computer club that's been around for awhile.

575
0:37:13,780 --> 0:37:17,120
 And that was

576
0:37:17,120 --> 0:37:22,260
 to make a law that requires every company to sent

577
0:37:22,260 --> 0:37:26,180
 each and every person that they've got data on a

578
0:37:26,180 --> 0:37:29,260
 letter once a year detailing what exactly

579
0:37:29,420 --> 0:37:36,340
 they have on them and if they don't have a physical address they have to use some

580
0:37:36,340 --> 0:37:41,980
 like whatever means of contact they have but essentially the idea was similar to

581
0:37:41,980 --> 0:37:50,040
 your taxation idea that that increases the cost and in this case also the

582
0:37:50,040 --> 0:37:57,460
 awareness of the users or the people that whose personal data is stored yeah

583
0:37:57,460 --> 0:38:04,420
 it increases the costs for the companies I mean yeah and that of course well yeah

584
0:38:04,420 --> 0:38:07,860
 I don't know that much about it but I wanted to mention it yeah it's a

585
0:38:07,860 --> 0:38:11,140
 there's certainly an argument about making it more obvious for people how

586
0:38:11,140 --> 0:38:17,140
 much they're being spied on but on the other hand I don't think postal services

587
0:38:17,140 --> 0:38:25,960
 are good as tax collectors it would basically be a stamp tax right postage

588
0:38:25,960 --> 0:38:26,620
 stamp tax

589
0:38:27,460 --> 0:38:32,360
 but but yeah I mean anything anything that will will shift the balance in the

590
0:38:32,360 --> 0:38:38,200
 right direction is fine with me but I think I would prefer to use it to raise

591
0:38:38,200 --> 0:38:43,120
 revenue that could then be used beneficially rather than just to boost

592
0:38:43,120 --> 0:38:50,340
 up the postal companies of the different countries I know very little about

593
0:38:50,340 --> 0:38:56,940
 politics and how to implement laws and taxation so could you talk a little bit

594
0:38:56,940 --> 0:38:57,180
 about

595
0:38:57,460 --> 0:39:02,640
 how how it would be implemented practically would it require some

596
0:39:02,640 --> 0:39:07,840
 technical solutions or is it basically just asking every company to report how

597
0:39:07,840 --> 0:39:15,400
 much data they've been collecting I can imagine many ways of doing it but I

598
0:39:15,400 --> 0:39:21,120
 would prefer to leave it to people who are good at writing that kind of stuff

599
0:39:21,120 --> 0:39:25,640
 how to implement I mean companies are supposed to report a lot of stuff these

600
0:39:25,640 --> 0:39:27,260
 days and that seems to work mostly

601
0:39:27,460 --> 0:39:33,220
 so I think having them reported on the penalty of you know we're going to

602
0:39:33,220 --> 0:39:38,640
 nationalize your company if you lie that is ultimately what happens in I mean if

603
0:39:38,640 --> 0:39:44,360
 you lie about the the yearly accounts or whatever basically the company can be

604
0:39:44,360 --> 0:39:50,020
 dissolved that's pretty much the law of any land if it's badly bad enough they

605
0:39:50,020 --> 0:39:54,260
 can just hold a company right and I think it should just be handled the same

606
0:39:54,260 --> 0:39:54,400
 way and and similarly if you travel across the feelings which I that sometimes

607
0:39:54,400 --> 0:39:54,460
 can go sit in your car and having the company suit and popular on its own so

608
0:39:54,460 --> 0:39:54,500
 yeah and and similarly if if turbulence is okay in most countries the only improvement

609
0:39:54,500 --> 0:39:56,620
 there is no model you could live in that situation versus proportionally Кстати

610
0:39:56,620 --> 0:39:56,700
 that means three erstatement good rooms where villa managers can live Bob's all right so

611
0:39:56,700 --> 0:39:57,440
 you can have time and you can have different people and businesses so it's a good way to

612
0:39:57,460 --> 0:40:04,400
 If you have a company that's permitted to use dangerous chemicals and an inspection

613
0:40:04,400 --> 0:40:11,260
 shows that you have not lived up to the conditions of that, your company will be shut down.

614
0:40:11,260 --> 0:40:18,440
 This is perfectly normal regulatory business, I think, it's just it's cyber so we shouldn't

615
0:40:18,440 --> 0:40:23,980
 touch it because we need to get the politicians over that hump and tell them to actually get

616
0:40:23,980 --> 0:40:30,240
 on with their job.

617
0:40:30,240 --> 0:40:34,920
 Thank you for the very nice talk, very depressing talk.

618
0:40:34,920 --> 0:40:40,580
 I just wanted to add one thing which was you said many cars or expensive cars have this

619
0:40:40,580 --> 0:40:47,880
 and in fact it's all cars sold in the European Union after April of 2018 are required to

620
0:40:47,880 --> 0:40:49,880
 have cellular connectivity now.

621
0:40:49,880 --> 0:40:52,820
 Yeah, but that's for the emergency thing.

622
0:40:52,820 --> 0:40:53,960
 They're not required to use it.

623
0:40:53,960 --> 0:40:57,740
 They're not required to use it for telemetry, but since they paid to install it.

624
0:40:57,740 --> 0:41:01,980
 So I think if they have it, then it's usually it's going to associate with every tower.

625
0:41:01,980 --> 0:41:06,540
 It's online all the time in practice.

626
0:41:06,540 --> 0:41:10,520
 Yes.

627
0:41:10,520 --> 0:41:12,520
 Any more questions?

628
0:41:12,520 --> 0:41:13,520
 No.

629
0:41:13,520 --> 0:41:14,520
 Good.

630
0:41:14,520 --> 0:41:16,520
 We got it opened up a bit.

631
0:41:16,520 --> 0:41:17,520
 Yeah.

632
0:41:17,520 --> 0:41:19,920
 Well, thank you very much, Paul Henning.

633
0:41:19,920 --> 0:41:22,220
 That was an excellent and interesting talk.

634
0:41:22,220 --> 0:41:23,220
 Thanks.

635
0:41:23,960 --> 0:41:24,780
 Thank you.
