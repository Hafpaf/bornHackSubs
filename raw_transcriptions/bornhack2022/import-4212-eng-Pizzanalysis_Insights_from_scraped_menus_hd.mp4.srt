 Tanya Cushman Reviewer.

2
0:00:16,200 --> 0:00:20,200
 So, a long time ago, I scraped Just Eat,

3
0:00:20,200 --> 0:00:24,240
 and the reason I did it was I had a coop.pizza domain,

4
0:00:24,240 --> 0:00:26,740
 and I needed a project.

5
0:00:26,740 --> 0:00:31,340
 The database consisted of over 200,000 pizzas.

6
0:00:31,340 --> 0:00:32,980
 And here's an example.

7
0:00:32,980 --> 0:00:34,640
 So, I have some columns here.

8
0:00:34,640 --> 0:00:36,380
 We have a description, name, price,

9
0:00:36,380 --> 0:00:38,280
 and I also have restaurant data.

10
0:00:39,200 --> 0:00:40,500
 So, let's explore.

11
0:00:41,740 --> 0:00:43,940
 If we look at a heat map of the restaurants,

12
0:00:43,940 --> 0:00:46,700
 we can see Copenhagen is very popular.

13
0:00:46,700 --> 0:00:50,840
 And if we zoom in on Copenhagen, we can see lines.

14
0:00:50,840 --> 0:00:53,240
 These are actually the regional S-trains.

15
0:00:54,120 --> 0:00:56,080
 And with all heat maps,

16
0:00:56,080 --> 0:00:59,280
 with geography, it's just a measure

17
0:00:59,280 --> 0:01:02,320
 of how dense the population is.

18
0:01:03,740 --> 0:01:07,520
 Now, if we look at the descriptions of pizzas,

19
0:01:07,520 --> 0:01:10,120
 we can see they list the ingredients.

20
0:01:10,120 --> 0:01:13,520
 So, with some tricks, we can pass the ingredients,

21
0:01:14,520 --> 0:01:17,420
 and then we can embed the ingredients in the vector space

22
0:01:17,420 --> 0:01:19,840
 using Google's Word2Vec,

23
0:01:19,840 --> 0:01:22,080
 and now we get pizza2vec.

24
0:01:22,080 --> 0:01:24,840
 So, I have, I don't know if you can see the vectors,

25
0:01:24,840 --> 0:01:26,040
 but ingredients,

26
0:01:26,040 --> 0:01:28,700
 that are used together in pizzas,

27
0:01:28,700 --> 0:01:31,380
 are close together in the vector space.

28
0:01:31,380 --> 0:01:35,580
 So, now we can ask interesting questions like,

29
0:01:35,580 --> 0:01:39,600
 what is the most similar ingredient to pineapple?

30
0:01:39,600 --> 0:01:40,780
 And the answer is peas.

31
0:01:42,780 --> 0:01:45,580
 And which ingredients are the most similar to pesto?

32
0:01:46,560 --> 0:01:49,580
 And it's like, ingredients on fancy pizzas.

33
0:01:51,000 --> 0:01:52,760
 And like, in general, we can see,

34
0:01:52,760 --> 0:01:56,040
 if we use clustering algorithms on the vector space,

35
0:01:56,040 --> 0:01:59,220
 we can see clusters of typical pizzas,

36
0:01:59,220 --> 0:02:02,740
 like pepperoni pizzas, or salad pizzas, or fancy pizzas.

37
0:02:05,780 --> 0:02:07,280
 Another interesting thing,

38
0:02:07,280 --> 0:02:08,620
 when we consider the ingredients,

39
0:02:08,620 --> 0:02:12,380
 is how much value does an ingredient add

40
0:02:12,380 --> 0:02:13,700
 to the price of the pizza?

41
0:02:15,380 --> 0:02:18,040
 So, can we predict prices,

42
0:02:18,040 --> 0:02:20,200
 pizza prices, from the ingredients,

43
0:02:20,200 --> 0:02:24,040
 and then look at how much does an ingredient affect the price?

44
0:02:25,080 --> 0:02:25,960
 So, I did that.

45
0:02:26,040 --> 0:02:28,260
 And like, I think we can, for certain,

46
0:02:28,260 --> 0:02:32,880
 say that pineapple on pizza, like, is bad, economically.

47
0:02:33,940 --> 0:02:35,880
 So, if we like, ignore causality,

48
0:02:35,880 --> 0:02:38,420
 like, you could pull away the pineapple on the pizza

49
0:02:38,420 --> 0:02:43,220
 and sell it for more, in another place.

50
0:02:43,220 --> 0:02:44,440
 And like, we can definitely see, like,

51
0:02:44,440 --> 0:02:46,120
 more fancy pizzas at the top,

52
0:02:46,120 --> 0:02:49,080
 like adding pesto to your pizza increases the price

53
0:02:49,080 --> 0:02:50,660
 by, what, eight kroner?

54
0:02:54,240 --> 0:02:55,400
 Another interesting thing,

55
0:02:55,400 --> 0:02:58,100
 is to look at something I call the margarita index.

56
0:02:58,100 --> 0:03:01,780
 So, like, we can just look at normal-sized margaritas

57
0:03:01,780 --> 0:03:05,040
 on all, like, on all pizzerias.

58
0:03:06,940 --> 0:03:10,520
 The problem is, margarita is, like, very hard to spell.

59
0:03:11,780 --> 0:03:13,040
 So, it's more like this.

60
0:03:15,580 --> 0:03:17,200
 This was hard to visualize.

61
0:03:17,200 --> 0:03:20,160
 But, like, in general, we can see that slices,

62
0:03:20,160 --> 0:03:22,540
 like, pizza slices, cheaper in bigger cities,

63
0:03:22,540 --> 0:03:25,280
 and whole pizzas aren't cheaper in the bigger cities.

64
0:03:25,400 --> 0:03:30,160
 And that's it.

65
0:03:30,160 --> 0:03:33,440
 Like, I think there's a lot of interesting further research,

66
0:03:33,440 --> 0:03:36,500
 like what's the opposite of a pineapple pizza?

67
0:03:36,500 --> 0:03:38,780
 Like, we can embed pizzas into a vector space, as well,

68
0:03:38,780 --> 0:03:41,200
 and just look at, like, the opposite vector.

69
0:03:41,200 --> 0:03:44,400
 But also, like, I noticed that I had a database dump

70
0:03:44,400 --> 0:03:45,900
 from, like, several months ago,

71
0:03:45,900 --> 0:03:48,220
 so I can actually track inflation...

72
0:03:48,220 --> 0:03:50,700
 Quite well.

73
0:03:50,700 --> 0:03:52,940
 And also, like, looking at purchasing power,

74
0:03:52,940 --> 0:03:54,080
 so we can look at these, like, prices of pizza.

75
0:03:54,080 --> 0:03:57,700
 like prices of pizza versus how much do people earn in that region.

76
0:03:58,780 --> 0:04:02,080
 And I think this is a really interesting indicator for the stock market.

77
0:04:02,440 --> 0:04:06,800
 And I think I can find spurious correlations that gives that result.

78
0:04:07,680 --> 0:04:08,480
 And that's it.
