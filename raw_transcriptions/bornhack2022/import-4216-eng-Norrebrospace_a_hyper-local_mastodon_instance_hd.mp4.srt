 Tanya Cushman Reviewer's name

0:00:15,000 --> 0:00:19,000
 Hello, welcome everybody to the lightning talks.

3
0:00:19,000 --> 0:00:22,500
 We have seven talks now because one was canceled.

4
0:00:22,500 --> 0:00:24,500
 So if you spontaneously want to do a talk,

5
0:00:24,500 --> 0:00:29,000
 you can come up here towards the end and we will have time for you.

6
0:00:29,000 --> 0:00:34,000
 And we are starting with this talk by Asbjorn.

7
0:00:34,000 --> 0:00:36,000
 Thank you.

8
0:00:36,000 --> 0:00:39,000
 Oh, is there a timer I should be keeping track of?

9
0:00:39,000 --> 0:00:42,000
 Yes, perfect. All right, good.

10
0:00:42,000 --> 0:00:47,000
 Neopro Space is a Mastodon instance that I've run for a year and a half,

11
0:00:47,000 --> 0:00:49,000
 something like that, almost two years now.

12
0:00:49,000 --> 0:00:51,000
 This talk is just about my experience running a small,

13
0:00:51,000 --> 0:00:54,000
 geographically centered, hyperlocal Mastodon instance.

14
0:00:54,000 --> 0:00:57,000
 What is Mastodon? Half of you probably are thinking.

15
0:00:57,000 --> 0:00:59,000
 What is this? What's ActivityPub?

16
0:00:59,000 --> 0:01:01,000
 Well, I'll let you know.

17
0:01:01,000 --> 0:01:04,000
 Mastodon is microblogging. You're probably familiar with Twitter.

18
0:01:04,000 --> 0:01:06,000
 It's essentially that.

19
0:01:06,000 --> 0:01:09,000
 Short posts instead of tweets, they're called toots

20
0:01:09,000 --> 0:01:13,000
 because the logo is a Mastodon.

21
0:01:13,000 --> 0:01:15,000
 Yeah, it looks like this.

22
0:01:15,000 --> 0:01:18,000
 This is sort of the default UI.

23
0:01:18,000 --> 0:01:22,000
 It's by default 500 characters instead of 240 or whatever it is on Twitter.

24
0:01:22,000 --> 0:01:25,000
 The cool thing about Mastodon is that it's federated.

25
0:01:25,000 --> 0:01:28,000
 So I can run my own server or I can join somebody else's server,

26
0:01:28,000 --> 0:01:31,000
 and then we can talk to each other even though we're not on the same server.

27
0:01:31,000 --> 0:01:35,000
 It works sort of like email or matrix or other federated standards in these ways.

28
0:01:35,000 --> 0:01:38,000
 So Novel Space is one of these.

29
0:01:38,000 --> 0:01:40,000
 Another cool thing is that Mastodon is based on ActivityPub,

30
0:01:40,000 --> 0:01:44,000
 which is a worldwide web consortium standard for federating social media.

31
0:01:44,000 --> 0:01:47,000
 So Mastodon is the microblogging tool,

32
0:01:47,000 --> 0:01:50,000
 but the Fediverse consists of lots of different stuff.

33
0:01:50,000 --> 0:01:53,000
 FunkWhale is like SoundCloud, and PixelFed is like Instagram,

34
0:01:53,000 --> 0:01:56,000
 and even WordPress is federated with ActivityPub.

35
0:01:56,000 --> 0:01:57,000
 So you can talk.

36
0:01:57,000 --> 0:01:59,000
 You can talk across different social media.

37
0:01:59,000 --> 0:02:02,000
 It's very open and interoperable.

38
0:02:02,000 --> 0:02:03,000
 So why did I make this thing?

39
0:02:03,000 --> 0:02:05,000
 It's very silly, like a neighborhood thing.

40
0:02:05,000 --> 0:02:06,000
 Why did I do it?

41
0:02:06,000 --> 0:02:09,000
 I think we were biking home from CryptoHagen at one point,

42
0:02:09,000 --> 0:02:11,000
 and I had probably had one too many beers,

43
0:02:11,000 --> 0:02:13,000
 when we were looking at the TLDs,

44
0:02:13,000 --> 0:02:15,000
 and I was like, .space, that sounds super cool.

45
0:02:15,000 --> 0:02:17,000
 What can I do with this?

46
0:02:17,000 --> 0:02:19,000
 And I went home and designed a sticker,

47
0:02:19,000 --> 0:02:21,000
 and then I bought the domain,

48
0:02:21,000 --> 0:02:23,000
 and then I set up the website.

49
0:02:23,000 --> 0:02:25,000
 So it was really an experiment in itself.

50
0:02:25,000 --> 0:02:27,000
 So it was really an experiment in itself.

51
0:02:27,000 --> 0:02:29,000
 It was a sticker-driven development.

52
0:02:29,000 --> 0:02:31,000
 The hypothesis I had was,

53
0:02:31,000 --> 0:02:33,000
 if I just put up enough stickers around Napro,

54
0:02:33,000 --> 0:02:35,000
 can I sort of decentralize,

55
0:02:35,000 --> 0:02:37,000
 move people from Twitter to Mastodon?

56
0:02:37,000 --> 0:02:39,000
 It's an ambitious thought, but I tried it out.

57
0:02:39,000 --> 0:02:42,000
 And it sort of kind of worked, right?

58
0:02:42,000 --> 0:02:44,000
 So are people using it?

59
0:02:44,000 --> 0:02:45,000
 Yeah.

60
0:02:45,000 --> 0:02:46,000
 Kind of, right?

61
0:02:46,000 --> 0:02:48,000
 We're 75 users.

62
0:02:48,000 --> 0:02:51,000
 30-ish of them are monthly active users.

63
0:02:51,000 --> 0:02:54,000
 But this is actually exactly what I want.

64
0:02:54,000 --> 0:02:55,000
 Mastodon is federated,

65
0:02:55,000 --> 0:02:57,000
 so it's nice to have a lot of small communities

66
0:02:57,000 --> 0:02:59,000
 that then talk to each other.

67
0:02:59,000 --> 0:03:02,000
 So we have 30-ish users here,

68
0:03:02,000 --> 0:03:04,000
 and that's a good size.

69
0:03:04,000 --> 0:03:06,000
 Then Elon bought Twitter.

70
0:03:06,000 --> 0:03:08,000
 Mass exodus.

71
0:03:08,000 --> 0:03:10,000
 And then...

72
0:03:10,000 --> 0:03:12,000
 I don't have that slide.

73
0:03:12,000 --> 0:03:14,000
 That's fine.

74
0:03:14,000 --> 0:03:16,000
 Three or four other Danish servers showed up.

75
0:03:16,000 --> 0:03:19,000
 Napro.space was the first Danish-language server.

76
0:03:19,000 --> 0:03:22,000
 After Napro.space, there's now Helvet.net,

77
0:03:22,000 --> 0:03:24,000
 Turing, Fest & Deco, Data Co-op,

78
0:03:24,000 --> 0:03:27,000
 which somebody will talk about is there.

79
0:03:27,000 --> 0:03:31,000
 So there's five or six small community servers

80
0:03:31,000 --> 0:03:33,000
 with all tens of users.

81
0:03:33,000 --> 0:03:35,000
 And they, of course, can talk to each other.

82
0:03:35,000 --> 0:03:36,000
 And then, you know,

83
0:03:36,000 --> 0:03:39,000
 Chaos Communication Congress and stuff also have a server.

84
0:03:39,000 --> 0:03:42,000
 Here's a question that some of you are thinking about,

85
0:03:42,000 --> 0:03:45,000
 which I've bothered with a lot.

86
0:03:45,000 --> 0:03:47,000
 Napro has an รถ in it,

87
0:03:47,000 --> 0:03:50,000
 and you can't really have รถs in domain names.

88
0:03:50,000 --> 0:03:52,000
 Some of you might be familiar with puny coding.

89
0:03:52,000 --> 0:03:53,000
 That's the bottom representation

90
0:03:53,000 --> 0:03:57,000
 of a URL where you do xn, dash, dash,

91
0:03:57,000 --> 0:03:59,000
 and then weird stuff.

92
0:03:59,000 --> 0:04:01,000
 I tried in the beginning to run Mastodon

93
0:04:01,000 --> 0:04:03,000
 with a puny-coded domain name.

94
0:04:03,000 --> 0:04:05,000
 It is not fun.

95
0:04:05,000 --> 0:04:07,000
 The main problem really was

96
0:04:07,000 --> 0:04:11,000
 that I ended up stopping using the puny code for

97
0:04:11,000 --> 0:04:14,000
 was that registration emails, right?

98
0:04:14,000 --> 0:04:16,000
 You'd sign up for Mastodon,

99
0:04:16,000 --> 0:04:18,000
 then you'd get an email back that was like,

100
0:04:18,000 --> 0:04:20,000
 oh, do you want to confirm that I just signed up

101
0:04:20,000 --> 0:04:22,000
 for xn, dash, dash, garbage, garbage, garbage?

102
0:04:22,000 --> 0:04:25,000
 And like, nobody wants to see,

103
0:04:25,000 --> 0:04:27,000
 confirm that they just signed up for something

104
0:04:27,000 --> 0:04:30,000
 that doesn't look at all what they just signed up for.

105
0:04:30,000 --> 0:04:32,000
 So we ended up falling back

106
0:04:32,000 --> 0:04:34,000
 and just using Napro with an รถ,

107
0:04:34,000 --> 0:04:37,000
 which bothers me a little bit,

108
0:04:37,000 --> 0:04:38,000
 but I tried.

109
0:04:38,000 --> 0:04:40,000
 I've heard that puny coding has gotten better

110
0:04:40,000 --> 0:04:42,000
 in Mastodon since then,

111
0:04:42,000 --> 0:04:44,000
 but still when it's an interoperable standard like this,

112
0:04:44,000 --> 0:04:46,000
 you need to talk to other servers as well.

113
0:04:46,000 --> 0:04:47,000
 So how is it in PixelFed?

114
0:04:47,000 --> 0:04:49,000
 How is it in Preruma?

115
0:04:49,000 --> 0:04:50,000
 So I ended up just,

116
0:04:50,000 --> 0:04:51,000
 I have all those domains,

117
0:04:51,000 --> 0:04:53,000
 but they just point to napro.space

118
0:04:53,000 --> 0:04:55,000
 because then stuff works.

119
0:04:57,000 --> 0:04:59,000
 Yeah, that's about it.

120
0:04:59,000 --> 0:05:00,000
 Come say hi on Mastodon.

121
0:05:00,000 --> 0:05:01,000
 It's good fun.

122
0:05:01,000 --> 0:05:02,000
 There's lots of servers.

123
0:05:02,000 --> 0:05:03,000
 Napro.space is not the only one.

124
0:05:03,000 --> 0:05:05,000
 You're also allowed on Napro.space

125
0:05:05,000 --> 0:05:07,000
 if you don't live on or near Napro.

126
0:05:07,000 --> 0:05:09,000
 And the hashtag BornHack,

127
0:05:09,000 --> 0:05:11,000
 hashtag on ActivityPub is comfy,

128
0:05:11,000 --> 0:05:13,000
 and your toots will show up on the slideshow.

129
0:05:13,000 --> 0:05:15,000
 Yeah, that's it.
