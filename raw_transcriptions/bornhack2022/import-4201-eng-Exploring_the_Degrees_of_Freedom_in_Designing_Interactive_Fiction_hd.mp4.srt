0:00:00,000 --> 0:00:15,440
 So let's get started.

2
0:00:16,000 --> 0:00:18,140
 So interactive fiction is a kind of game.

3
0:00:18,540 --> 0:00:21,020
 So before we get into that, we need to talk about what is a game.

4
0:00:21,760 --> 0:00:27,620
 So I am not really a game developer, and probably many definitions of what a game is, but I

5
0:00:27,620 --> 0:00:28,660
 have tried to define it here.

6
0:00:28,660 --> 0:00:33,980
 So a game is like you have a state, and then from that state you have choices, which leads

7
0:00:33,980 --> 0:00:34,700
 to other states.

8
0:00:35,360 --> 0:00:38,220
 And that is a game, because it requires interaction.

9
0:00:39,600 --> 0:00:42,620
 Then the next step is to define what is a good game.

10
0:00:43,200 --> 0:00:49,040
 So that's a more difficult question, so we need to involve some more mathematics.

11
0:00:49,480 --> 0:00:54,940
 So if we start by saying that the uppercase C is the set of all possible choices in a

12
0:00:54,940 --> 0:00:55,400
 given game.

13
0:00:55,400 --> 0:01:01,120
 And then we define if to be a function from this set of choices to the real numbers that

14
0:01:01,120 --> 0:01:06,560
 calculates what we define as choice funness, such that the higher the number, the more

15
0:01:06,560 --> 0:01:08,280
 fun the choice is.

16
0:01:08,280 --> 0:01:16,300
 Then a good game is a game where f of C1 is equal to f of C2 for all C1 and all C2 in

17
0:01:16,300 --> 0:01:17,780
 the set of choices.

18
0:01:17,780 --> 0:01:23,100
 So as an example of this, we have this from before, but in this case, all if evaluates

19
0:01:23,100 --> 0:01:24,100
 to 1.

20
0:01:24,100 --> 0:01:25,100
 Such that all choices give us a set of choices.

21
0:01:25,400 --> 0:01:27,800
 So we have a set of choices that give the same amount of fun.

22
0:01:27,800 --> 0:01:32,940
 So for example, as an example of a game that does not have this property, you could think

23
0:01:32,940 --> 0:01:41,340
 of a normal 3D game where, for example, you might have to try to enter into a nice quest

24
0:01:41,340 --> 0:01:46,720
 that gives you lots of funness, or you could also choose to just walk around in a circle

25
0:01:46,720 --> 0:01:48,880
 that gives you less funness.

26
0:01:48,880 --> 0:01:51,080
 So that makes that a bad game.

27
0:01:51,080 --> 0:01:55,400
 And of course, this definition immediately disqualifies almost all existing games.

28
0:01:55,400 --> 0:02:00,960
 But I think it's like a useful thing to aim for.

29
0:02:00,960 --> 0:02:06,140
 So the next thing is just to give you an overview of the games I play, to put this talk in context.

30
0:02:06,140 --> 0:02:11,440
 So these are the 10 most recent played games on my Steam profile page.

31
0:02:11,440 --> 0:02:18,420
 So I've just kind of different genres, but I can see multiple genres, multiple games

32
0:02:18,420 --> 0:02:23,400
 that kind of are in the genre of text heavy and simulation heavy.

33
0:02:23,400 --> 0:02:24,400
 And then there are some other ones.

34
0:02:24,400 --> 0:02:25,400
 So I'm going to show you some of them.

35
0:02:25,400 --> 0:02:29,000
 These are the ones that are kind of more just action.

36
0:02:29,000 --> 0:02:35,280
 But for example, this one to the left, Cinemaware Anthology, that's games from the 90s where

37
0:02:35,280 --> 0:02:39,000
 they kind of tried to make a movie and it kind of failed.

38
0:02:39,000 --> 0:02:42,100
 It's called Cinemaware or Bookware.

39
0:02:42,100 --> 0:02:45,580
 It's kind of from that full motion video period in time.

40
0:02:45,580 --> 0:02:46,740
 Kind of didn't work out.

41
0:02:46,740 --> 0:02:47,740
 Interesting ideas.

42
0:02:47,740 --> 0:02:52,980
 And then right here down to the right, we have Heaven's Vault, which is a super nice game.

43
0:02:52,980 --> 0:02:54,400
 It's extremely text heavy.

44
0:02:54,400 --> 0:03:01,220
 Essentially a text game, but with some graphics added on to make it more editable for people.

45
0:03:01,220 --> 0:03:06,440
 And the core gameplay loop in this game is to decode a human language, which I think

46
0:03:06,440 --> 0:03:08,760
 is like a great gameplay loop.

47
0:03:08,760 --> 0:03:11,620
 So that's kind of an overview to put things in context.

48
0:03:11,620 --> 0:03:16,560
 So in this presentation, I would like to, so the background is I would like to create

49
0:03:16,560 --> 0:03:21,440
 a piece of interactive fiction that is a game consisting only of text.

50
0:03:21,440 --> 0:03:22,520
 I've never done so before.

51
0:03:22,520 --> 0:03:23,520
 I have kind of done it before.

52
0:03:23,520 --> 0:03:24,280
 I have kind of done it before.

53
0:03:24,280 --> 0:03:27,560
 I have kind of done a little bit, but not like a full-fledged game.

54
0:03:27,560 --> 0:03:30,480
 I haven't really done much game development in general.

55
0:03:30,480 --> 0:03:31,480
 That could be a pro.

56
0:03:31,480 --> 0:03:33,480
 It could also be a con.

57
0:03:33,480 --> 0:03:38,140
 And I know of several approaches to get started, but I have never been able to decide which

58
0:03:38,140 --> 0:03:40,200
 one to kind of go for.

59
0:03:40,200 --> 0:03:44,860
 So I'm doing this presentation in order to force me to make a choice, which is funny

60
0:03:44,860 --> 0:03:48,720
 because interactive games are also all about choices.

61
0:03:48,720 --> 0:03:53,400
 So today I will cover single player games, multiplayer games.

62
0:03:53,400 --> 0:03:58,700
 And then I will try to think of applications of the underlying technology in non-interactive

63
0:03:58,700 --> 0:04:05,740
 fiction because maybe we can kind of spread out and use it in a general fashion.

64
0:04:05,740 --> 0:04:09,180
 So about interactive fiction.

65
0:04:09,180 --> 0:04:15,560
 It's kind of a very broad category, kind of at the top, at the most obvious level is text

66
0:04:15,560 --> 0:04:16,560
 adventure games.

67
0:04:16,560 --> 0:04:19,160
 Then we have choose your own adventure books.

68
0:04:19,160 --> 0:04:20,680
 Some of you know these.

69
0:04:20,680 --> 0:04:21,520
 We have visual novels.

70
0:04:21,520 --> 0:04:22,520
 We have movie novels.

71
0:04:22,520 --> 0:04:23,240
 We have books.

72
0:04:23,240 --> 0:04:27,560
 We have multi-user dungeons that's multiplayer, but also mostly text-based.

73
0:04:27,560 --> 0:04:32,760
 And then we also have mainstream games that have, for example, dialogue trees and essentially

74
0:04:32,760 --> 0:04:39,040
 everything that is kind of text-centric in those, maybe some mini-games, maybe some other

75
0:04:39,040 --> 0:04:40,040
 stuff.

76
0:04:40,040 --> 0:04:41,560
 So it's kind of broad.

77
0:04:41,560 --> 0:04:45,780
 I would like to maybe focus it a bit more today just in order to be able to finish this

78
0:04:45,780 --> 0:04:47,060
 talk at all.

79
0:04:47,060 --> 0:04:49,700
 So there are some prominent examples of interactive fiction.

80
0:04:49,700 --> 0:04:52,660
 We have Sork from the 70s.

81
0:04:53,240 --> 0:04:55,360
 Kind of re-released in the 80s as well.

82
0:04:55,360 --> 0:04:58,920
 We have the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, which was released as a text adventure game

83
0:04:58,920 --> 0:05:02,120
 by Infocom in 1984.

84
0:05:02,120 --> 0:05:03,120
 Super hard.

85
0:05:03,120 --> 0:05:04,120
 I have never completed it.

86
0:05:04,120 --> 0:05:08,380
 It's a good idea, but in practice it completely fails as a game, I think.

87
0:05:08,380 --> 0:05:12,740
 Then we have Lambda Moo, which is one of these multiplayer games.

88
0:05:12,740 --> 0:05:20,560
 And then I guess around 20 years ago, the commercial aspect of these games, 20, 30 years

89
0:05:20,560 --> 0:05:22,600
 ago even, kind of declined.

90
0:05:22,600 --> 0:05:28,120
 And since then, it has mostly been a hobbyist endeavor to create these text adventures,

91
0:05:28,120 --> 0:05:30,720
 which is funny because that's also how it started.

92
0:05:30,720 --> 0:05:37,720
 So it's kind of only around the 80s, but this was a proper commercial way of doing game

93
0:05:37,720 --> 0:05:38,720
 development.

94
0:05:38,720 --> 0:05:42,460
 And then kind of starting again a bit now, but not in its pure form.

95
0:05:42,460 --> 0:05:50,320
 Kind of used as a side part to more mainstream kind of gameplays.

96
0:05:50,320 --> 0:05:52,480
 In order to be able to focus in on something.

97
0:05:52,480 --> 0:05:56,840
 You can say there are two broad categories of interactive fiction.

98
0:05:56,840 --> 0:06:01,940
 There's the one to my left here, which is where you actually enter commands on your

99
0:06:01,940 --> 0:06:02,940
 keyboard.

100
0:06:02,940 --> 0:06:09,460
 For example, you enter drink beer and then the parser says not understood.

101
0:06:09,460 --> 0:06:13,680
 Then you enter go on stage and then it says now you are standing on a stage.

102
0:06:13,680 --> 0:06:17,600
 Then you can view your inventory and then it says you are currently carrying an older

103
0:06:17,600 --> 0:06:18,600
 laptop.

104
0:06:18,600 --> 0:06:20,520
 And then you can connect the laptop to the display cable.

105
0:06:20,520 --> 0:06:22,480
 That can also be expressed.

106
0:06:22,480 --> 0:06:28,060
 In a different format, to my right, where instead of manually typing these choices,

107
0:06:28,060 --> 0:06:32,940
 you are presented with a list of valid choices and then you click on that.

108
0:06:32,940 --> 0:06:37,900
 The good thing about this is that there are no invalid inputs.

109
0:06:37,900 --> 0:06:43,380
 So for example, to my left I have this drink beer, which was not understood because the

110
0:06:43,380 --> 0:06:45,940
 game developer didn't implement that feature.

111
0:06:45,940 --> 0:06:50,600
 Whereas onto the right, that just doesn't exist because it's not implemented.

112
0:06:50,600 --> 0:06:51,940
 So the right version, where you pick from a list of choices.

113
0:06:51,940 --> 0:06:57,560
 It's kind of more limited, but it's also more precise, so you won't get into having

114
0:06:57,560 --> 0:06:59,480
 to fight the parser.

115
0:06:59,480 --> 0:07:02,880
 And for this talk, I will mostly focus on the format to the right, where you pick from

116
0:07:02,880 --> 0:07:06,160
 a list, because I think that's much, much nicer.

117
0:07:06,160 --> 0:07:12,560
 The old left version was kind of hip for most of interactive fiction's lifetime, but I think

118
0:07:12,560 --> 0:07:17,060
 the right version is becoming more and more popular.

119
0:07:17,060 --> 0:07:20,060
 So to start with, let's focus on single-player games.

120
0:07:20,060 --> 0:07:21,320
 So let's start with single-player games.

121
0:07:21,940 --> 0:07:28,400
 So I haven't, as I said, really been much active in this field of game development,

122
0:07:28,400 --> 0:07:32,000
 but I was actually active once when I was a child.

123
0:07:32,000 --> 0:07:35,100
 I used to do much of this interactive fiction.

124
0:07:35,100 --> 0:07:40,720
 So I guess about 18 years ago, I was quite prolific.

125
0:07:40,720 --> 0:07:46,220
 So to give you an example of what interactive fiction is, I will show you something I did

126
0:07:46,220 --> 0:07:47,220
 back then.

127
0:07:47,220 --> 0:07:51,940
 It's a horror story centered around kind of my greatest fear back then.

128
0:07:51,940 --> 0:07:55,300
 Which was having to take a shower.

129
0:07:55,300 --> 0:07:58,760
 So let's try to find it here.

130
0:07:58,760 --> 0:08:00,420
 Yes.

131
0:08:00,420 --> 0:08:03,400
 So we can try to run it.

132
0:08:03,400 --> 0:08:07,000
 It doesn't work because it's a Microsoft Word file.

133
0:08:07,000 --> 0:08:11,640
 So we have to open it instead, I guess.

134
0:08:11,640 --> 0:08:14,840
 So this is kind of, you have some pages, right?

135
0:08:14,840 --> 0:08:20,620
 And then the format is that, oh, sorry, the format is that you have this step one and

136
0:08:20,620 --> 0:08:21,780
 then some choices.

137
0:08:21,780 --> 0:08:23,460
 Which leads to other steps.

138
0:08:23,460 --> 0:08:28,020
 But instead of doing this manually, what you can do is close this one, and then I entered

139
0:08:28,020 --> 0:08:33,880
 it into a tool I made, a vital bag.

140
0:08:33,880 --> 0:08:35,360
 Let's try this.

141
0:08:35,360 --> 0:08:37,660
 It's in Danish, but I will translate it if you go along.

142
0:08:37,660 --> 0:08:41,900
 We're not going to do the entire game because even though it's short, I have lots of other

143
0:08:41,900 --> 0:08:43,880
 things I want to talk about.

144
0:08:43,880 --> 0:08:46,260
 So okay, the starting page, right?

145
0:08:46,260 --> 0:08:50,260
 When you start the game, we mentioned this, it says like, okay, you're going through your

146
0:08:50,260 --> 0:08:51,260
 yearly shower.

147
0:08:51,260 --> 0:08:54,860
 Of course you don't want to, and you're really fighting this.

148
0:08:54,860 --> 0:08:57,560
 You close your eyes and think about what to do.

149
0:08:57,560 --> 0:09:03,360
 And then choice one is to try to escape, but my adults are probably too strong.

150
0:09:03,360 --> 0:09:06,220
 And choice two is try to be clever.

151
0:09:06,220 --> 0:09:10,760
 So two fingers for two, one finger for one.

152
0:09:10,760 --> 0:09:13,980
 Okay, I see, let's try to be clever.

153
0:09:13,980 --> 0:09:14,980
 Then we click on this.

154
0:09:14,980 --> 0:09:15,980
 Okay.

155
0:09:15,980 --> 0:09:16,980
 What does it say?

156
0:09:16,980 --> 0:09:17,940
 It says cleverness is fine.

157
0:09:17,940 --> 0:09:18,940
 You are waiting till you are smart.

158
0:09:18,940 --> 0:09:19,940
 Okay.

159
0:09:19,940 --> 0:09:20,940
 Okay.

160
0:09:20,940 --> 0:09:23,080
 You are waiting till you are in the bathroom.

161
0:09:23,080 --> 0:09:27,460
 Then you hurry out and lock the door with the secret key, which hasn't been introduced

162
0:09:27,460 --> 0:09:28,460
 yet.

163
0:09:28,460 --> 0:09:30,180
 So that's kind of an interesting gameplay thing.

164
0:09:30,180 --> 0:09:38,200
 Your dad yells at you and your mom says you are a lab thing went wrong.

165
0:09:38,200 --> 0:09:39,200
 What are you going to do now?

166
0:09:39,200 --> 0:09:42,700
 So this is actually kind of relatable because I haven't showered for a couple of days here

167
0:09:42,700 --> 0:09:43,700
 at Bornhack.

168
0:09:43,700 --> 0:09:48,300
 So it's kind of, kind of, I get kind of get in the zone by playing this, right?

169
0:09:48,300 --> 0:09:50,740
 So let's take one more choice and then we can continue.

170
0:09:50,740 --> 0:09:58,260
 So, uh, choice one is go outside in the air and play, choice two is go up and play PlayStation.

171
0:09:58,260 --> 0:10:00,260
 One or two?

172
0:10:00,260 --> 0:10:02,620
 I kind of see PlayStation trumping.

173
0:10:02,620 --> 0:10:03,980
 Let's try a trick test.

174
0:10:03,980 --> 0:10:09,440
 You are sitting peacefully up in your room and playing GTA Vice City, but suddenly you

175
0:10:09,440 --> 0:10:14,200
 can hear your dad's feet on the way of the chairs, the stairs.

176
0:10:14,200 --> 0:10:15,620
 What are you going to do now?

177
0:10:15,620 --> 0:10:16,620
 Okay.

178
0:10:16,620 --> 0:10:18,260
 Let's stop this for now because I think if we just continue, just picking some, oh, oh,

179
0:10:18,260 --> 0:10:28,280
 uh, you jump out, but you forgot that you are on this, uh, really high up in an apartment.

180
0:10:28,280 --> 0:10:29,760
 So you die at the end.

181
0:10:29,760 --> 0:10:30,760
 Okay.

182
0:10:30,760 --> 0:10:31,760
 So that was a quick game, right?

183
0:10:31,760 --> 0:10:33,540
 That's good because then we can continue along.

184
0:10:33,540 --> 0:10:40,100
 So the point of this was that this is a static graph of, uh, of choices.

185
0:10:40,100 --> 0:10:44,780
 So even if you reset it, it's not going to be widely different, which tries some other

186
0:10:44,780 --> 0:10:45,780
 choices.

187
0:10:45,780 --> 0:10:47,260
 They are all statically defined.

188
0:10:47,260 --> 0:10:48,260
 Uh.

189
0:10:48,260 --> 0:10:51,380
 It's not a very interesting game if you try to replay it, or even if you just start to

190
0:10:51,380 --> 0:10:56,260
 think about how it's, how it's created because there's no simulation underneath, it's kind

191
0:10:56,260 --> 0:10:57,260
 of boring.

192
0:10:57,260 --> 0:11:09,020
 Uh, so there is this trend, um, in, in games in general that you would like to do a remaster.

193
0:11:09,020 --> 0:11:12,800
 I have noticed this and I am sure most other people have noticed this as well.

194
0:11:12,800 --> 0:11:16,280
 So many remasters, so many special editions, uh, the graphics are improved.

195
0:11:16,280 --> 0:11:17,280
 Uh.

196
0:11:17,280 --> 0:11:19,960
 But it's the same game underneath.

197
0:11:19,960 --> 0:11:25,440
 So what I wanted to do today was to make a remaster of my old game, but not just to recreate

198
0:11:25,440 --> 0:11:31,280
 it, but to, instead of having this static graph of choices, make it into a full blown

199
0:11:31,280 --> 0:11:35,780
 simulation, or at least start doing that.

200
0:11:35,780 --> 0:11:45,280
 So, uh, what I mean by that is that let's go into my editor and then, uh, let's create

201
0:11:45,280 --> 0:11:46,280
 a new file.

202
0:11:46,280 --> 0:11:47,280
 Okay.

203
0:11:47,280 --> 0:11:53,620
 Um, so there is this, uh, programming language called, uh, Prolog, which is really, really

204
0:11:53,620 --> 0:11:54,620
 cool.

205
0:11:54,620 --> 0:11:55,620
 Woo.

206
0:11:55,620 --> 0:11:58,620
 Uh, and it's quite old.

207
0:11:58,620 --> 0:12:02,660
 And the interesting part is when you say simulation, it's not really clear what you're going for.

208
0:12:02,660 --> 0:12:08,020
 You're going for like old school eighties, uh, symbolic, uh, simulation of, of kind of

209
0:12:08,020 --> 0:12:09,020
 objects.

210
0:12:09,020 --> 0:12:11,460
 Are you gonna go full machine learning?

211
0:12:11,460 --> 0:12:14,720
 And I am not going to go full machine learning because I don't really understand it.

212
0:12:14,720 --> 0:12:16,160
 So I'm going back to the eighties.

213
0:12:16,160 --> 0:12:17,160
 Okay.

214
0:12:17,160 --> 0:12:26,740
 Uh, uh, implement a world of facts that kind of, uh, uh, correspond to the ideas in the

215
0:12:26,740 --> 0:12:30,580
 original static graph of choices game.

216
0:12:30,580 --> 0:12:34,780
 So let's start by defining the facts of this world.

217
0:12:34,780 --> 0:12:37,500
 So we can say we have some parents, right?

218
0:12:37,500 --> 0:12:40,980
 Oh, you can make some predicates.

219
0:12:40,980 --> 0:12:41,980
 It's okay.

220
0:12:41,980 --> 0:12:43,500
 If you don't know Prolog, most people don't.

221
0:12:43,500 --> 0:12:46,500
 It can be hard to learn, but once you learn it, the great thing is, uh, that's not really

222
0:12:46,500 --> 0:12:47,860
 much to it.

223
0:12:47,860 --> 0:12:50,580
 Uh, what you see is pretty much what's there.

224
0:12:50,580 --> 0:12:52,100
 There's no extra hidden features.

225
0:12:52,100 --> 0:12:54,140
 Uh, it's kind of just what it is.

226
0:12:54,140 --> 0:12:55,440
 That's great.

227
0:12:55,440 --> 0:12:58,800
 So we have two parents, right?

228
0:12:58,800 --> 0:12:59,800
 And what else?

229
0:12:59,800 --> 0:13:06,320
 Uh, it can also be useful probably to define what a person is.

230
0:13:06,320 --> 0:13:08,120
 So a person is a person.

231
0:13:08,120 --> 0:13:15,080
 If that person is a parent and the person is also a person, if that person is you, that's

232
0:13:15,080 --> 0:13:16,380
 what a person is.

233
0:13:16,380 --> 0:13:24,160
 And now we can evaluate this so we can say what persons exists.

234
0:13:24,160 --> 0:13:27,240
 So a person can be that or mom or you.

235
0:13:27,240 --> 0:13:30,400
 So that's all the set of possible persons in this game.

236
0:13:30,400 --> 0:13:33,100
 That's fine.

237
0:13:33,100 --> 0:13:38,900
 The next thing is to try to define what possible actions do we have.

238
0:13:38,900 --> 0:13:42,740
 So for this one, we will make a predicate called possible.

239
0:13:42,740 --> 0:13:45,560
 So this for a given state.

240
0:13:45,560 --> 0:13:46,380
 How can we progress?

241
0:13:46,380 --> 0:13:48,240
 From that state to another state.

242
0:13:48,240 --> 0:13:50,880
 That's what we want to define.

243
0:13:50,880 --> 0:13:52,880
 So what do I have?

244
0:13:52,880 --> 0:13:54,300
 Uh, yes.

245
0:13:54,300 --> 0:13:58,940
 So the point of this game is to avoid taking a shower.

246
0:13:58,940 --> 0:14:06,620
 So let's say that it's possible for a person to take a shower.

247
0:14:06,620 --> 0:14:16,160
 Uh, if this is, if, if, uh, that person is in the bathroom.

248
0:14:16,380 --> 0:14:25,600
 And the bathroom is locked, is locked because if the bathroom is not locked, uh, you will

249
0:14:25,600 --> 0:14:27,500
 automatically escape from this.

250
0:14:27,500 --> 0:14:29,260
 That's kind of the rules of this world.

251
0:14:29,260 --> 0:14:30,260
 And okay.

252
0:14:30,260 --> 0:14:38,060
 So a side note here, um, I think one of the things, uh, in many modern games is that you

253
0:14:38,060 --> 0:14:43,680
 start playing it and then at some point you don't know what to do, and then you have to

254
0:14:43,680 --> 0:14:46,240
 exit the game and go to some kind of weekend.

255
0:14:46,240 --> 0:14:47,080
 I think that's pretty tricky.

256
0:14:47,080 --> 0:14:48,960
 And then there are so many details on that.

257
0:14:48,960 --> 0:14:49,960
 And I hate that.

258
0:14:49,960 --> 0:14:53,520
 I want everything to be in the game and that's what we're doing right now.

259
0:14:53,520 --> 0:14:56,860
 We're defining everything from scratch all of the game world.

260
0:14:56,860 --> 0:14:59,580
 So that's I think, perfect.

261
0:14:59,580 --> 0:15:02,480
 Um, so we can kind of continue this.

262
0:15:02,480 --> 0:15:06,860
 Uh, so now we have said that it's possible to shower.

263
0:15:06,860 --> 0:15:14,000
 Um, but apart from that, we also have to define these new predicates that we kind of just

264
0:15:14,000 --> 0:15:15,500
 assumed were present.

265
0:15:15,500 --> 0:15:16,100
 So we can say.

266
0:15:16,240 --> 0:15:31,240
 say, a bathroom is locked if someone, if you have some person, and that person has performed

267
0:15:31,240 --> 0:15:38,560
 the action of locking the bathroom. This might seem kind of obvious, but we have to define

268
0:15:38,560 --> 0:15:43,760
 every single thing ourselves, so there will be some obvious things because humans don't

269
0:15:43,760 --> 0:15:53,420
 think kind of in discrete steps all the time, but our simulation will have to do that. And

270
0:15:53,420 --> 0:15:59,880
 you can continue with that, so we can also say that to be able to lock something, like

271
0:15:59,880 --> 0:16:05,860
 to be able to do this thing that we claim we want to do, if it's possible, it's only

272
0:16:05,860 --> 0:16:10,880
 possible for a person to lock the bathroom, or to lock any kind of location, let's try

273
0:16:10,880 --> 0:16:12,700
 to generalize it.

274
0:16:12,700 --> 0:16:13,700
 If

275
0:16:13,700 --> 0:16:28,140
 you have, let's say, that person has some key, and let's say that key locks the location.

276
0:16:28,140 --> 0:16:39,460
 Oh, I've made, this is too much, yes. Yes, all right. And you can kind of continue along

277
0:16:39,460 --> 0:16:42,640
 with this, but I also want to cover other things today.

278
0:16:42,640 --> 0:16:52,140
 So I cheated from home and made one like this, where it's similar but has more kind

279
0:16:52,140 --> 0:17:05,520
 of content. So let's try to evaluate some of this, so imagine that we have these lines

280
0:17:05,520 --> 0:17:08,600
 of the world defining what kind of simulation we're in, and then our first step is to..

281
0:17:08,600 --> 0:17:09,600
 I've worse things to my computers. You can continue like this for 60 seconds, okay?

282
0:17:09,600 --> 0:17:09,640
 One minute, then we collapse.

283
0:17:09,640 --> 0:17:09,800
 One minute.

284
0:17:09,800 --> 0:17:09,940
 That's it.

285
0:17:09,940 --> 0:17:09,980
 Go ahead, and let's start moving.

286
0:17:09,980 --> 0:17:10,280
 0, I was coffee.

287
0:17:10,280 --> 0:17:10,420
 There we go.

288
0:17:10,420 --> 0:17:10,460
 There we go.

289
0:17:10,480 --> 0:17:10,800
 No, where's b går end we end.

290
0:17:10,800 --> 0:17:10,840
 There we go.

291
0:17:10,840 --> 0:17:11,080
 There's a lot of colleagues.

292
0:17:11,080 --> 0:17:11,120
 It adds them up.

293
0:17:11,120 --> 0:17:11,160
 Yes.

294
0:17:11,160 --> 0:17:11,280
 Yes, there are a lot of cases where you see that.

295
0:17:11,280 --> 0:17:11,360
 Yes.

296
0:17:11,360 --> 0:17:22,980
 first step is to, let's say, check where we are. So we can query the world and say,

297
0:17:22,980 --> 0:17:30,440
 where am I right now? In you where? And then it says completely, it doesn't know that,

298
0:17:30,440 --> 0:17:37,400
 and that's because we haven't really defined the concept of locations. We have kind of

299
0:17:37,400 --> 0:17:45,140
 set like, okay, there's this bathroom location, but we haven't actually defined any location

300
0:17:45,140 --> 0:17:51,160
 existing outside of the bathroom. So the beginning game state is just, you exist, but you're

301
0:17:51,160 --> 0:17:56,720
 not actually anywhere at all, but you can go to the bathroom. So that's kind of something

302
0:17:56,720 --> 0:18:01,880
 you could add on, make a better simulation by actually having the concept of locations.

303
0:18:01,880 --> 0:18:06,860
 We don't need that for now, we are kind of ignorant. So, and more interesting query is

304
0:18:06,860 --> 0:18:07,360
 probably...

305
0:18:07,400 --> 0:18:17,220
 to say, like, what do the NPCs do? So we can say, given the starting state, what will

306
0:18:17,220 --> 0:18:20,280
 the dad do?

307
0:18:20,280 --> 0:18:36,860
 Uh, oh, did I do something wrong?

308
0:18:36,860 --> 0:18:50,620
 No, that should work.

309
0:18:50,620 --> 0:18:54,520
 Unknown procedure...

310
0:18:54,520 --> 0:19:01,740
 So Prolog is quite fun, but it's also quite fun to debug it, right? So let's see...

311
0:19:01,740 --> 0:19:02,740
 Uh...

312
0:19:02,740 --> 0:19:03,740
 Uh...

313
0:19:03,740 --> 0:19:04,740
 Uh...

314
0:19:04,740 --> 0:19:05,740
 Uh...

315
0:19:05,740 --> 0:19:06,740
 Uh...

316
0:19:06,740 --> 0:19:07,620
 Uh...

317
0:19:07,620 --> 0:19:08,620
 What if I just do...

318
0:19:08,620 --> 0:19:09,620
 This?

319
0:19:09,620 --> 0:19:10,620
 Okay.

320
0:19:10,620 --> 0:19:11,620
 So we can see that...

321
0:19:11,620 --> 0:19:28,620
 What it says that we are querying what possible acts does the dad have, and the dad has the

322
0:19:28,620 --> 0:19:34,980
 action, it can carry himself to the bathroom, it can carry the mom to the bathroom, it can

323
0:19:34,980 --> 0:19:36,580
 carry my... me to the bathroom.

324
0:19:36,580 --> 0:19:37,580
 Okay.

325
0:19:37,580 --> 0:19:38,580
 So it's likely that the NPC will take the final action, let's say that.

326
0:19:38,580 --> 0:19:39,580
 Oh, he can also grab himself.

327
0:19:39,580 --> 0:19:40,580
 That sounds weird.

328
0:19:40,580 --> 0:19:41,580
 Okay.

329
0:19:41,580 --> 0:19:42,580
 That's the four possible actions.

330
0:19:42,580 --> 0:19:43,580
 So let's say that it's...

331
0:19:43,580 --> 0:19:44,580
 This action, he wants to carry you to the bathroom, so let's try to...

332
0:19:44,580 --> 0:19:45,580
 Uh...

333
0:19:45,580 --> 0:19:46,580
 Introduce that as a fact in our program.

334
0:19:46,580 --> 0:19:47,580
 So now that's kind of established.

335
0:19:47,580 --> 0:19:48,580
 So let's try to...

336
0:19:48,580 --> 0:19:49,580
 Uh...

337
0:19:49,580 --> 0:19:50,580
 Uh...

338
0:19:50,580 --> 0:19:51,580
 Uh...

339
0:19:51,580 --> 0:19:52,580
 Uh...

340
0:19:52,580 --> 0:19:53,580
 Uh...

341
0:19:53,580 --> 0:19:54,580
 Uh...

342
0:19:54,580 --> 0:19:55,580
 Uh...

343
0:19:55,580 --> 0:19:56,580
 Uh...

344
0:19:56,580 --> 0:19:57,580
 Uh...

345
0:19:57,580 --> 0:19:58,580
 Uh...

346
0:19:58,580 --> 0:19:59,580
 Uh...

347
0:19:59,580 --> 0:20:00,580
 Uh...

348
0:20:00,580 --> 0:20:01,580
 Uh...

349
0:20:01,580 --> 0:20:02,580
 Uh...

350
0:20:02,580 --> 0:20:03,580
 Uh...

351
0:20:03,580 --> 0:20:04,580
 Uh...

352
0:20:04,580 --> 0:20:05,580
 Uh...

353
0:20:05,580 --> 0:20:06,580
 Uh...

354
0:20:06,580 --> 0:20:07,580
 Uh...

355
0:20:07,580 --> 0:20:08,580
 Uh...

356
0:20:08,580 --> 0:20:09,580
 Uh...

357
0:20:09,580 --> 0:20:10,580
 Uh...

358
0:20:10,580 --> 0:20:11,580
 Uh...

359
0:20:11,580 --> 0:20:12,580
 Uh...

360
0:20:12,580 --> 0:20:13,580
 Uh...

361
0:20:13,580 --> 0:20:14,580
 Uh...

362
0:20:14,580 --> 0:20:15,580
 Uh...

363
0:20:15,580 --> 0:20:16,580
 Uh...

364
0:20:16,580 --> 0:20:17,580
 Uh...

365
0:20:17,580 --> 0:20:18,580
 Uh...

366
0:20:18,580 --> 0:20:19,580
 Uh...

367
0:20:19,580 --> 0:20:20,580
 Uh...

368
0:20:20,580 --> 0:20:21,580
 Uh...

369
0:20:21,580 --> 0:20:22,580
 Uh...

370
0:20:22,580 --> 0:20:23,580
 Uh...

371
0:20:23,580 --> 0:20:24,580
 Uh...

372
0:20:24,580 --> 0:20:25,580
 Uh...

373
0:20:25,580 --> 0:20:26,580
 Uh...

374
0:20:27,580 --> 0:20:28,580
 Uh...

375
0:20:28,580 --> 0:20:29,580
 Uh...

376
0:20:29,580 --> 0:20:30,580
 Uh...

377
0:20:30,580 --> 0:20:31,580
 Uh...

378
0:20:31,580 --> 0:20:32,580
 Uh...

379
0:20:32,580 --> 0:20:33,580
 Uh...

380
0:20:33,580 --> 0:20:34,580
 Uh...

381
0:20:34,580 --> 0:20:35,580
 Uh...

382
0:20:35,580 --> 0:20:39,960
 possible because we introduced this action up here of being carried to the

383
0:20:39,960 --> 0:20:44,740
 bathroom so if you try to comment that out and again ask like what are my

384
0:20:44,740 --> 0:20:48,960
 choices from the beginning state of the game it will just say oh there are no

385
0:20:48,960 --> 0:20:56,940
 possible choices so it's important that we have this choice so if you want to do

386
0:20:56,940 --> 0:21:01,800
 the same thing as we try to do in the playthrough just before in the old

387
0:21:01,800 --> 0:21:09,680
 version of the game what we're going to do now is grab the bathroom key so I

388
0:21:09,680 --> 0:21:24,760
 guess let's do that so we enter this you grab the bathroom key now that is done

389
0:21:26,380 --> 0:21:31,180
 and then I think we may have to remove some facts now

390
0:21:31,180 --> 0:21:31,580
 no

391
0:21:31,800 --> 0:21:33,480
 Let's see if it says so.

392
0:21:36,280 --> 0:21:38,980
 Yes, we used to have this fact that the bathroom key was

393
0:21:38,980 --> 0:21:40,660
 reachable, but now that we have grabbed it,

394
0:21:40,660 --> 0:21:42,460
 we need to remove this.

395
0:21:42,460 --> 0:21:44,560
 This is a limitation of Prolog.

396
0:21:44,560 --> 0:21:48,920
 You can retract some things, but it's also a bit limited,

397
0:21:48,920 --> 0:21:50,880
 and we are kind of abusing it.

398
0:21:50,880 --> 0:21:55,680
 So what you would want to do is make

399
0:21:55,680 --> 0:21:58,980
 a nicer Prolog-based system that extends this

400
0:21:58,980 --> 0:22:02,220
 with some nicer features.

401
0:22:02,220 --> 0:22:09,520
 So now there's, did we fully retract this bathroom key?

402
0:22:12,040 --> 0:22:13,160
 Yeah, that's fine.

403
0:22:13,160 --> 0:22:15,000
 All right.

404
0:22:15,000 --> 0:22:22,940
 So let's go on and then say, what possible actions

405
0:22:22,940 --> 0:22:25,380
 do we have now that we have taken the bathroom key?

406
0:22:25,380 --> 0:22:27,700
 So OK, now that we have the bathroom key,

407
0:22:27,700 --> 0:22:28,980
 we have this new action possible.

408
0:22:28,980 --> 0:22:30,900
 Which is to lock the bathroom.

409
0:22:30,900 --> 0:22:32,080
 What else can we do?

410
0:22:32,080 --> 0:22:34,000
 We can still grab ourselves.

411
0:22:34,000 --> 0:22:35,600
 We can escape from bathroom.

412
0:22:35,600 --> 0:22:37,920
 So we could escape from bathroom,

413
0:22:37,920 --> 0:22:40,620
 but it makes more sense to lock it first and then escape.

414
0:22:40,620 --> 0:22:42,440
 So let's try that.

415
0:22:42,440 --> 0:22:46,440
 Still manually entering it into the program as a new fact.

416
0:22:46,440 --> 0:22:49,660
 So we make the actions of locking the bathroom,

417
0:22:49,660 --> 0:22:58,040
 and then we make the action of escaping from bathroom.

418
0:22:58,040 --> 0:22:58,540
 OK.

419
0:22:58,980 --> 0:23:03,520
 And now let's see.

420
0:23:03,520 --> 0:23:06,620
 So we did a lot of actions, kind of unfair to the NPCs.

421
0:23:06,620 --> 0:23:10,940
 So let's see what is the possible action for our dad.

422
0:23:13,880 --> 0:23:15,740
 He can shower.

423
0:23:15,740 --> 0:23:18,740
 He can carry himself to the bathroom.

424
0:23:18,740 --> 0:23:21,340
 He can carry the mom to the bathroom.

425
0:23:21,340 --> 0:23:24,840
 No, he shouldn't be able to do that.

426
0:23:24,840 --> 0:23:27,360
 OK, so clearly there are some logic errors here.

427
0:23:27,360 --> 0:23:28,980
 But it's quite fun to debug these things.

428
0:23:28,980 --> 0:23:33,440
 Because you're not traversing a static graph of choices.

429
0:23:33,440 --> 0:23:36,820
 You're traversing this simulation, which has state,

430
0:23:36,820 --> 0:23:38,120
 that goes to another state.

431
0:23:38,120 --> 0:23:42,320
 And then sometimes you get kind of emergent behavior.

432
0:23:42,320 --> 0:23:45,280
 You don't really expect that, oh, yes, this action makes sense.

433
0:23:45,280 --> 0:23:48,920
 Because it's entirely enforced by our system

434
0:23:48,920 --> 0:23:51,120
 that this action is possible.

435
0:23:51,120 --> 0:23:53,040
 And if you don't want that action to be possible,

436
0:23:53,040 --> 0:23:55,740
 it's because we didn't manage to implement

437
0:23:55,740 --> 0:23:57,680
 the simulation correctly.

438
0:23:57,680 --> 0:23:58,880
 So it's kind of a combination.

439
0:23:58,880 --> 0:24:01,420
 Of being able to do more things that you didn't kind of think

440
0:24:01,420 --> 0:24:03,340
 were possible, but the system tells you,

441
0:24:03,340 --> 0:24:04,540
 yes, this is indeed possible.

442
0:24:08,180 --> 0:24:11,840
 So let's move on.

443
0:24:11,840 --> 0:24:15,040
 This was 60 lines of prologue, kind of buggy,

444
0:24:15,040 --> 0:24:17,340
 kind of showing what you could do.

445
0:24:17,340 --> 0:24:18,580
 To do this better, you would want

446
0:24:18,580 --> 0:24:21,840
 to have a more full simulation, where what you do

447
0:24:21,840 --> 0:24:26,140
 is for each character you have, you give them a goal.

448
0:24:26,140 --> 0:24:28,880
 And then they will try to achieve this goal.

449
0:24:28,880 --> 0:24:32,180
 By taking the action that gives most utility to that.

450
0:24:32,180 --> 0:24:35,720
 That's also a very old idea, not really new in any regard.

451
0:24:35,720 --> 0:24:40,020
 But it's easy to implement in these prologue-like languages.

452
0:24:40,020 --> 0:24:44,280
 And that's kind of the way to go.

453
0:24:44,280 --> 0:24:46,120
 A couple of years back, eight years or so,

454
0:24:46,120 --> 0:24:50,520
 there was this system called Versu, which unfortunately

455
0:24:50,520 --> 0:24:55,520
 isn't available, because it was, there's a whole story about it.

456
0:24:55,520 --> 0:24:58,040
 But they made a nice paper, which kind of put together, you know,

457
0:24:58,040 --> 0:24:58,180
 a lot of things.

458
0:24:58,880 --> 0:25:03,380
 And they put together these ideas of these emergent simulation-based

459
0:25:03,380 --> 0:25:04,420
 game plays.

460
0:25:04,420 --> 0:25:07,580
 So you have this concept of contexts.

461
0:25:07,580 --> 0:25:11,580
 So in this, to my right here, we have the context pastry,

462
0:25:11,580 --> 0:25:14,720
 which contains one interaction possibility.

463
0:25:14,720 --> 0:25:18,680
 Then we have other contexts, which also contain

464
0:25:18,680 --> 0:25:21,040
 interaction possibilities.

465
0:25:21,040 --> 0:25:24,120
 And then these contexts can be added or removed

466
0:25:24,120 --> 0:25:25,940
 based on what you do.

467
0:25:25,940 --> 0:25:27,940
 And the game play is mostly centered

468
0:25:27,940 --> 0:25:32,540
 around very small human actions, like blinking to someone

469
0:25:32,540 --> 0:25:35,800
 or making an off-site remark.

470
0:25:35,800 --> 0:25:40,740
 And then all the characters are fully simulated.

471
0:25:40,740 --> 0:25:42,400
 And there are two levels to the simulation.

472
0:25:42,400 --> 0:25:47,140
 One is kind of a background state of the world

473
0:25:47,140 --> 0:25:50,780
 that they designed and reused across different games, which

474
0:25:50,780 --> 0:25:54,020
 contains so many concepts of locations and emotions

475
0:25:54,020 --> 0:25:54,940
 and so on.

476
0:25:54,940 --> 0:25:57,860
 And then the top layer is then the game itself, which then,

477
0:25:57,860 --> 0:25:57,940
 basically, is a game.

478
0:25:57,940 --> 0:26:04,020
 It builds onto this bottom layer and enables these characters

479
0:26:04,020 --> 0:26:07,500
 to really do lots of things, because they also

480
0:26:07,500 --> 0:26:08,900
 have to react to each other.

481
0:26:08,900 --> 0:26:11,240
 So you can have like a new reaction chain where

482
0:26:11,240 --> 0:26:13,880
 you do something, and then a character reacts,

483
0:26:13,880 --> 0:26:15,560
 and then another character reacts, and so on.

484
0:26:15,560 --> 0:26:17,140
 And the great thing is you can actually

485
0:26:17,140 --> 0:26:20,900
 play as any of the characters, because the system is

486
0:26:20,900 --> 0:26:23,240
 built on a strong foundation.

487
0:26:23,240 --> 0:26:27,280
 And it's kind of the same as I just did, but more time

488
0:26:27,280 --> 0:26:27,860
 and more development.

489
0:26:27,860 --> 0:26:30,140
 The budget and so on.

490
0:26:30,140 --> 0:26:32,480
 For tree of choices, this old-school approach,

491
0:26:32,480 --> 0:26:35,340
 there are some quite modern tools that extend it a little bit

492
0:26:35,340 --> 0:26:37,660
 and also give a nice user experience.

493
0:26:37,660 --> 0:26:39,000
 Trine is quite popular.

494
0:26:39,000 --> 0:26:41,040
 There's this ink language.

495
0:26:41,040 --> 0:26:43,980
 And there's also something called the yarn spinner,

496
0:26:43,980 --> 0:26:46,980
 which seems nice.

497
0:26:46,980 --> 0:26:49,840
 Then let's move on to multiplayer games.

498
0:26:49,840 --> 0:26:53,020
 This is not something I play a lot.

499
0:26:53,020 --> 0:26:57,140
 And when I do, I often find it quite hectic.

500
0:26:57,140 --> 0:27:00,080
 So if at all possible, I would prefer something a bit

501
0:27:00,080 --> 0:27:04,260
 like turn-based multiplayer games.

502
0:27:04,260 --> 0:27:07,900
 The basic idea in regards to interactive fiction

503
0:27:07,900 --> 0:27:13,380
 is to utilize the fact that humans

504
0:27:13,380 --> 0:27:16,960
 are story-generating devices.

505
0:27:16,960 --> 0:27:20,040
 So let's say you have two humans.

506
0:27:20,040 --> 0:27:23,260
 Then one human is saying something,

507
0:27:23,260 --> 0:27:25,820
 and the other is responding to that.

508
0:27:25,820 --> 0:27:26,480
 So for example.

509
0:27:26,480 --> 0:27:26,980
 This.

510
0:27:26,980 --> 0:27:27,120
 This.

511
0:27:27,120 --> 0:27:29,820
 This is my first attempt, where I'm just

512
0:27:29,820 --> 0:27:31,360
 trying to keep it as simple as possible.

513
0:27:31,360 --> 0:27:34,520
 We have a yellow guy and purple guy.

514
0:27:34,520 --> 0:27:37,780
 And yellow guy is the game master.

515
0:27:37,780 --> 0:27:40,880
 And he writes, you see a lamp that

516
0:27:40,880 --> 0:27:44,020
 is transmitted over the internet to this other person who

517
0:27:44,020 --> 0:27:47,140
 receives that and then has to act on it.

518
0:27:47,140 --> 0:27:49,340
 Then that person says, get lamp, which

519
0:27:49,340 --> 0:27:53,500
 is received by the game master, who then

520
0:27:53,500 --> 0:27:55,620
 says that the lamp explodes, which is then

521
0:27:55,620 --> 0:27:56,960
 received by the player.

522
0:27:56,960 --> 0:28:01,860
 This is kind of the simplest possible text-based multiplayer

523
0:28:01,860 --> 0:28:03,040
 experience.

524
0:28:03,040 --> 0:28:05,660
 The problem is that it's just chatting.

525
0:28:05,660 --> 0:28:07,620
 There's no system in place.

526
0:28:07,620 --> 0:28:09,760
 You can just chat, and there's nothing

527
0:28:09,760 --> 0:28:14,320
 enforced by a nice, complicated system, which we like.

528
0:28:14,320 --> 0:28:17,860
 It's also a problem that is super lopsided.

529
0:28:17,860 --> 0:28:20,300
 You have one person who is controlling the game

530
0:28:20,300 --> 0:28:23,200
 and one person who is only responding to it.

531
0:28:23,200 --> 0:28:24,960
 We would like something that is more balanced.

532
0:28:24,960 --> 0:28:26,800
 And we would like something that is more balanced.

533
0:28:26,800 --> 0:28:31,980
 And also, the game master has, it's not only lopsided,

534
0:28:31,980 --> 0:28:35,820
 it's also the game master has too much power.

535
0:28:35,820 --> 0:28:40,080
 So it's not fun, and it's not balanced.

536
0:28:40,080 --> 0:28:46,040
 So what we want to do is think about how can we kind of

537
0:28:46,040 --> 0:28:51,300
 zone in on a smaller area in these multiplayer text games

538
0:28:51,300 --> 0:28:53,700
 that we can actually explore.

539
0:28:53,700 --> 0:28:56,600
 And I thought about this, and I couldn't come up with anything.

540
0:28:56,600 --> 0:29:01,640
 So there's this idea of trying to limit the surface area

541
0:29:01,640 --> 0:29:03,840
 in order to get something done.

542
0:29:03,840 --> 0:29:06,700
 So I was just kind of waiting around for something

543
0:29:06,700 --> 0:29:07,480
 to happen to me.

544
0:29:07,480 --> 0:29:10,680
 And then one day, my friend Simon sent me an email

545
0:29:10,680 --> 0:29:14,980
 saying that these .Quest domain names are super cheap.

546
0:29:14,980 --> 0:29:16,340
 You should buy one.

547
0:29:16,340 --> 0:29:18,380
 And then I was like, oh yes, I'm going to buy one

548
0:29:18,380 --> 0:29:20,960
 and use it for my project.

549
0:29:20,960 --> 0:29:25,360
 And then I thought, OK, .Quest, what is .Quest?

550
0:29:25,360 --> 0:29:26,400
 What can I do?

551
0:29:26,400 --> 0:29:31,680
 And then I bought this domain.

552
0:29:31,680 --> 0:29:37,280
 And it's just, I have this nice Emacs web browser.

553
0:29:37,280 --> 0:29:42,600
 So you can just go to, I bought this domain.

554
0:29:42,600 --> 0:29:43,400
 Can I load it?

555
0:29:43,400 --> 0:29:45,880
 Do I have internet?

556
0:29:45,880 --> 0:29:50,040
 If I don't have internet, you can go to Hest.Quest.

557
0:29:50,040 --> 0:29:53,260
 This is funny because it's a pun.

558
0:29:53,260 --> 0:29:54,460
 No, it's not a pun, actually.

559
0:29:54,460 --> 0:29:55,160
 It rhymes.

560
0:29:55,160 --> 0:29:56,240
 And Hest in Danish means.

561
0:29:56,240 --> 0:29:58,960
 Horse.

562
0:29:58,960 --> 0:30:02,280
 So apparently it doesn't load, but that doesn't matter.

563
0:30:02,280 --> 0:30:05,700
 So I bought this horse website.

564
0:30:05,700 --> 0:30:07,540
 And then I had to learn about horses

565
0:30:07,540 --> 0:30:09,060
 in order to make games about horses.

566
0:30:09,060 --> 0:30:12,640
 So the great thing is, I thought, OK, interactive fiction

567
0:30:12,640 --> 0:30:14,520
 is such a big thing.

568
0:30:14,520 --> 0:30:16,480
 And if you want to make a simulation of the world,

569
0:30:16,480 --> 0:30:18,640
 that's such a big, big task.

570
0:30:18,640 --> 0:30:21,560
 So I thought, now that I have this horse website,

571
0:30:21,560 --> 0:30:25,000
 I can just make a very, very small simulation that only

572
0:30:25,000 --> 0:30:25,640
 involves horses.

573
0:30:25,640 --> 0:30:29,980
 Because I'm sure that they are less complicated than humans.

574
0:30:29,980 --> 0:30:31,880
 But I didn't know anything about horses.

575
0:30:31,880 --> 0:30:36,720
 So I went to the library in order to find out what's a horse.

576
0:30:36,720 --> 0:30:39,240
 There is this nice library next to where I live.

577
0:30:39,240 --> 0:30:42,000
 And I have kind of biked across it for 10 years,

578
0:30:42,000 --> 0:30:43,920
 but never actually been inside.

579
0:30:43,920 --> 0:30:46,200
 So I went inside and kind of looked for,

580
0:30:46,200 --> 0:30:48,720
 I found this giraffe book that's not a horse.

581
0:30:48,720 --> 0:30:49,780
 Then there's a zebra book.

582
0:30:49,780 --> 0:30:52,620
 It's kind of close to a horse, but not really.

583
0:30:52,620 --> 0:30:55,400
 And then I found some really nice books.

584
0:30:55,400 --> 0:30:57,020
 Books and games.

585
0:30:57,020 --> 0:30:58,840
 I kind of got distracted a bit.

586
0:30:58,840 --> 0:31:01,540
 Oh, and then I found, oh, this is a nice plaque.

587
0:31:01,540 --> 0:31:04,940
 So this one says, where is the book?

588
0:31:04,940 --> 0:31:07,700
 So I kind of zoomed in a bit.

589
0:31:07,700 --> 0:31:12,860
 And then you have some useful topics, starting with H.

590
0:31:12,860 --> 0:31:15,520
 And then I thought, oh, HEST, that's horse.

591
0:31:15,520 --> 0:31:16,160
 That's for me.

592
0:31:16,160 --> 0:31:18,580
 Now I can learn about what's a horse.

593
0:31:18,580 --> 0:31:24,360
 So a horse is 63.61, apparently, on this decimal system.

594
0:31:24,360 --> 0:31:25,280
 So I went to this.

595
0:31:25,400 --> 0:31:29,160
 And I thought, oh, that's one.

596
0:31:29,160 --> 0:31:31,500
 But there were no books.

597
0:31:31,500 --> 0:31:36,400
 Really, there were absolutely no books on horses.

598
0:31:36,400 --> 0:31:39,480
 So I was kind of devastated.

599
0:31:39,480 --> 0:31:41,780
 I don't know what to do.

600
0:31:41,780 --> 0:31:44,960
 Then I looked to the comics section.

601
0:31:44,960 --> 0:31:46,440
 And I found this nice comic.

602
0:31:46,440 --> 0:31:47,560
 I read this as a child.

603
0:31:47,560 --> 0:31:49,820
 And then I thought, well, I will borrow this.

604
0:31:49,820 --> 0:31:54,580
 So it's called SOS from in Danish.

605
0:31:54,580 --> 0:31:55,280
 So I bought it.

606
0:31:55,280 --> 0:31:56,220
 I borrowed it.

607
0:31:56,220 --> 0:31:59,320
 There's this nice self-service system on Danish libraries.

608
0:31:59,320 --> 0:31:59,980
 It just works.

609
0:32:02,680 --> 0:32:07,280
 So that comic I borrowed, I'm not

610
0:32:07,280 --> 0:32:09,400
 going to say this original title.

611
0:32:09,400 --> 0:32:12,060
 But it's by Greg and Franklin.

612
0:32:12,060 --> 0:32:13,860
 And it's actually the first release

613
0:32:13,860 --> 0:32:14,920
 of that series in Denmark.

614
0:32:14,920 --> 0:32:18,460
 But it's not the first chronologically speaking

615
0:32:18,460 --> 0:32:20,900
 from the origin country.

616
0:32:20,900 --> 0:32:21,780
 It's about fascism.

617
0:32:21,780 --> 0:32:23,640
 And the most important thing about it

618
0:32:23,640 --> 0:32:25,080
 is that it has a twist at the end.

619
0:32:25,280 --> 0:32:28,740
 And that kind of made me realize, OK, when I'm making a game,

620
0:32:28,740 --> 0:32:29,740
 I need a twist as well.

621
0:32:32,960 --> 0:32:35,680
 The day after, I went out to see some actual horses.

622
0:32:35,680 --> 0:32:37,020
 They are kind of in the background,

623
0:32:37,020 --> 0:32:40,100
 because I'm actually a little afraid of horses.

624
0:32:40,100 --> 0:32:42,060
 So I didn't want to go too close to them.

625
0:32:42,060 --> 0:32:44,860
 They're kind of strange animals.

626
0:32:44,860 --> 0:32:47,280
 So I observed them from a distance.

627
0:32:47,280 --> 0:32:55,160
 And what I realized is a horse eats, I guess, sleeps, walks,

628
0:32:55,160 --> 0:32:58,620
 runs, bites.

629
0:32:58,620 --> 0:33:01,700
 So the great thing is that without learning about horses,

630
0:33:01,700 --> 0:33:05,480
 we actually managed to restrict ourselves even further.

631
0:33:05,480 --> 0:33:08,180
 So that makes it possible to make a very contained game.

632
0:33:11,280 --> 0:33:14,160
 So I'm going to go through an example now.

633
0:33:14,160 --> 0:33:16,880
 So my game is called Hungry Horse.

634
0:33:16,880 --> 0:33:19,320
 This is a mug up.

635
0:33:19,320 --> 0:33:22,840
 The goal is that you are a horse, you are hungry,

636
0:33:22,840 --> 0:33:24,840
 and you want to eat something.

637
0:33:24,840 --> 0:33:29,520
 So in this game, it's similar to the example

638
0:33:29,520 --> 0:33:32,960
 I showed earlier with yellow guy and purple guy.

639
0:33:32,960 --> 0:33:39,200
 But now, we are using Prolog to enforce that nothing

640
0:33:39,200 --> 0:33:43,300
 happens that cannot happen.

641
0:33:43,300 --> 0:33:47,060
 So once you write down a fact, that fact is in the system,

642
0:33:47,060 --> 0:33:49,160
 and you have to abide by it.

643
0:33:49,160 --> 0:33:52,880
 So first, we say that you are a horse, and you are hungry.

644
0:33:52,880 --> 0:33:53,880
 That's the game.

645
0:33:53,880 --> 0:33:54,380
 OK.

646
0:33:54,380 --> 0:33:57,720
 And that's what the game master says.

647
0:33:57,720 --> 0:34:01,580
 And then the person who plays this game reads that,

648
0:34:01,580 --> 0:34:04,400
 and then suggests some new facts.

649
0:34:04,400 --> 0:34:09,000
 So the yellow facts are always final,

650
0:34:09,000 --> 0:34:12,200
 but the facts on this purple side are suggestions.

651
0:34:12,200 --> 0:34:17,420
 So the player says that, OK, in order to eat something,

652
0:34:17,420 --> 0:34:18,860
 that something has to be reachable.

653
0:34:21,660 --> 0:34:24,260
 And in order for that to be reachable,

654
0:34:24,260 --> 0:34:26,380
 in order for me to not be hungry anymore,

655
0:34:26,380 --> 0:34:29,880
 in order for me to, instead of be hungry, to be full,

656
0:34:29,880 --> 0:34:33,140
 I have to eat something.

657
0:34:33,140 --> 0:34:39,240
 This ad here is kind of an ad hoc extension of Prolog.

658
0:34:39,240 --> 0:34:40,900
 It doesn't exist.

659
0:34:40,900 --> 0:34:43,060
 It's to enforce that, normally, in Prolog,

660
0:34:43,060 --> 0:34:46,960
 if you have both the fact that you are hungry and you are full,

661
0:34:46,960 --> 0:34:48,180
 they can coexist.

662
0:34:48,180 --> 0:34:50,020
 We would like them to be exclusive,

663
0:34:50,020 --> 0:34:52,900
 such that when you enable this fact that you are full,

664
0:34:52,900 --> 0:34:54,140
 you will automatically remove the fact that you are full.

665
0:34:54,140 --> 0:34:58,620
 You can kind of implement that with some exclusive logic,

666
0:34:58,620 --> 0:35:02,380
 but that doesn't exist in Prolog.

667
0:35:02,380 --> 0:35:05,540
 So we are suggesting, the player is suggesting these facts,

668
0:35:05,540 --> 0:35:07,660
 that, yeah, you just have to eat something,

669
0:35:07,660 --> 0:35:08,820
 and then you're full.

670
0:35:08,820 --> 0:35:11,400
 And then what's happened is that the game master says,

671
0:35:11,400 --> 0:35:15,360
 fact not accepted, but here's a fact

672
0:35:15,360 --> 0:35:17,680
 that I think is close to what you suggested,

673
0:35:17,680 --> 0:35:20,740
 but something that I will accept.

674
0:35:20,740 --> 0:35:23,900
 So the game master says that, yes, you'll

675
0:35:23,900 --> 0:35:26,140
 become full if you eat something,

676
0:35:26,140 --> 0:35:30,340
 but that thing you eat have to contain enough food.

677
0:35:30,340 --> 0:35:33,740
 So we have this new enough food predicate,

678
0:35:33,740 --> 0:35:43,260
 which is defined as that something can just

679
0:35:43,260 --> 0:35:45,180
 be enough food, but it can also be enough food

680
0:35:45,180 --> 0:35:48,580
 if it's similar to another thing which is also enough food.

681
0:35:48,580 --> 0:35:51,380
 So that's kind of some more levels to this.

682
0:35:51,380 --> 0:35:52,600
 So that is now a fact.

683
0:35:52,600 --> 0:35:53,740
 You can work with it.

684
0:35:53,740 --> 0:35:56,820
 You can become full if you eat something that has enough food

685
0:35:56,820 --> 0:35:57,980
 for you.

686
0:35:57,980 --> 0:36:00,600
 And then the game master continues, saying,

687
0:36:00,600 --> 0:36:01,960
 you are standing in a barn.

688
0:36:01,960 --> 0:36:03,940
 Next to you is a pile of hay.

689
0:36:03,940 --> 0:36:05,700
 So the obvious step for the player

690
0:36:05,700 --> 0:36:10,960
 is then to kind of state that, I think that this pile of hay

691
0:36:10,960 --> 0:36:12,940
 is enough food for me.

692
0:36:12,940 --> 0:36:16,580
 But then the game master can say, fact not accepted.

693
0:36:16,580 --> 0:36:18,620
 And then the player has to think of another thing.

694
0:36:18,620 --> 0:36:21,260
 OK, the player just looks around, like, what else do I see

695
0:36:21,260 --> 0:36:22,580
 than this pile of hay?

696
0:36:22,580 --> 0:36:23,040
 And the game master says, then, OK, I'm going to eat this.

697
0:36:23,040 --> 0:36:23,060
 OK, I'm going to eat this.

698
0:36:23,060 --> 0:36:23,400
 OK, I'm going to eat this.

699
0:36:23,400 --> 0:36:23,540
 OK, I'm going to eat this.

700
0:36:23,540 --> 0:36:23,580
 OK, I'm going to eat this.

701
0:36:23,580 --> 0:36:23,720
 OK, I'm going to eat this.

702
0:36:23,740 --> 0:36:25,180
 OK, you are standing in a barn.

703
0:36:25,180 --> 0:36:27,080
 There's a small window behind you.

704
0:36:27,080 --> 0:36:29,860
 You are surrounded by a short fence outside of which

705
0:36:29,860 --> 0:36:31,500
 exists the barn building.

706
0:36:31,500 --> 0:36:34,920
 So I'm not sure about the barn terminology.

707
0:36:34,920 --> 0:36:37,200
 It's probably not called like a barn and a barn building,

708
0:36:37,200 --> 0:36:39,760
 but let's accept that for now.

709
0:36:39,760 --> 0:36:42,640
 So in addition, the game master provides some new facts

710
0:36:42,640 --> 0:36:46,320
 that, OK, we have this new concept of a location,

711
0:36:46,320 --> 0:36:48,300
 and you are apparently in the barn.

712
0:36:48,300 --> 0:36:50,860
 And we say that there's a connection between the barn

713
0:36:50,860 --> 0:36:52,200
 and the window.

714
0:36:52,200 --> 0:36:53,240
 Oh.

715
0:36:53,240 --> 0:36:55,900
 And the outside.

716
0:36:55,900 --> 0:36:58,200
 And there's also a connection between the barn and the fence

717
0:36:58,200 --> 0:37:01,420
 that has been mentioned and the general barn building, barn

718
0:37:01,420 --> 0:37:03,000
 area.

719
0:37:03,000 --> 0:37:05,980
 And then the game master also defines the concept

720
0:37:05,980 --> 0:37:12,060
 of locations and how to be able to cross between locations,

721
0:37:12,060 --> 0:37:13,180
 which we can kind of ignore.

722
0:37:13,180 --> 0:37:15,600
 But the game master has to do this

723
0:37:15,600 --> 0:37:17,520
 because the underlying system doesn't

724
0:37:17,520 --> 0:37:19,520
 have a built-in concept of different locations,

725
0:37:19,520 --> 0:37:23,040
 like in our first single-player example.

726
0:37:23,040 --> 0:37:26,420
 Then the player tries to be clever.

727
0:37:26,420 --> 0:37:31,260
 So the player has to define what is height.

728
0:37:31,260 --> 0:37:35,920
 You can say that something can be low or something can be tall.

729
0:37:35,920 --> 0:37:42,100
 So the player defines that low is lower than high

730
0:37:42,100 --> 0:37:47,820
 and says that horses always jump high, and the fence is low.

731
0:37:47,820 --> 0:37:50,840
 That's kind of the claim that the player then tries to make,

732
0:37:50,840 --> 0:37:52,240
 and the game master has to approve.

733
0:37:52,240 --> 0:37:52,740
 OK.

734
0:37:53,040 --> 0:37:57,280
 And then the player tries to define the act

735
0:37:57,280 --> 0:38:01,040
 of crossing something by saying that you can cross something

736
0:38:01,040 --> 0:38:06,680
 if you can jump over it, and you are jumping higher

737
0:38:06,680 --> 0:38:10,060
 than the object itself is.

738
0:38:10,060 --> 0:38:12,060
 And the game master says, OK, that is fair.

739
0:38:12,060 --> 0:38:14,800
 That sounds like how the world kind of works.

740
0:38:14,800 --> 0:38:16,460
 And then the game master continues saying,

741
0:38:16,460 --> 0:38:18,000
 you are in the barn building now.

742
0:38:18,000 --> 0:38:19,960
 Around you are many barn cubicles.

743
0:38:19,960 --> 0:38:22,580
 Again, not sure about the terminology, but many barn

744
0:38:22,580 --> 0:38:23,040
 cubicles.

745
0:38:23,040 --> 0:38:25,480
 Containing a variety of animals.

746
0:38:25,480 --> 0:38:28,600
 And again, some new facts like, OK, this new location

747
0:38:28,600 --> 0:38:30,640
 is connected to these other locations,

748
0:38:30,640 --> 0:38:33,660
 and there's this tall barrier, which is high.

749
0:38:33,660 --> 0:38:35,980
 So you cannot jump over it, because you

750
0:38:35,980 --> 0:38:39,740
 have to jump higher than high, which is not defined currently.

751
0:38:39,740 --> 0:38:42,580
 Then the player just kind of, this

752
0:38:42,580 --> 0:38:44,160
 is something that horses do, apparently.

753
0:38:44,160 --> 0:38:47,200
 They just kind of neigh.

754
0:38:47,200 --> 0:38:49,260
 And then the game master says, many horses

755
0:38:49,260 --> 0:38:50,980
 reply with a neigh of their own.

756
0:38:50,980 --> 0:38:53,040
 The collective sound vibrations destroy the soul,

757
0:38:53,040 --> 0:38:56,520
 the lamb that has been lighting up the barn.

758
0:38:56,520 --> 0:39:02,600
 So now there's a new fact to our world that the light is off.

759
0:39:02,600 --> 0:39:09,760
 Then the player has to use this fact and says that, OK, we

760
0:39:09,760 --> 0:39:13,140
 say that the concept of jumping only

761
0:39:13,140 --> 0:39:18,000
 exists because we can see how high something is.

762
0:39:18,000 --> 0:39:21,340
 So the player tries to convince the game master that I

763
0:39:21,340 --> 0:39:22,900
 can jump to any height.

764
0:39:22,900 --> 0:39:27,560
 If I cannot see what I'm jumping across,

765
0:39:27,560 --> 0:39:31,260
 which is a super silly idea, but we define this world.

766
0:39:31,260 --> 0:39:34,660
 So if the game master accepts that fact,

767
0:39:34,660 --> 0:39:37,040
 then we kind of accept it.

768
0:39:37,040 --> 0:39:40,120
 And then the player also says that, since this is a fact now,

769
0:39:40,120 --> 0:39:42,660
 I hope, I want to cross this tall barrier,

770
0:39:42,660 --> 0:39:44,220
 because now I am blind.

771
0:39:44,220 --> 0:39:46,680
 And then I will eat lots of food.

772
0:39:46,680 --> 0:39:48,540
 And the game master says, OK.

773
0:39:48,540 --> 0:39:52,860
 And then now at this point, we can use prologue or something,

774
0:39:52,900 --> 0:39:56,720
 similar to verify that this goal that we had from the beginning,

775
0:39:56,720 --> 0:39:58,760
 that we are no longer hungry, but now full,

776
0:39:58,760 --> 0:40:01,680
 has been verified based on the facts that we have introduced

777
0:40:01,680 --> 0:40:04,000
 during this gameplay.

778
0:40:04,000 --> 0:40:07,780
 So our actions are completely enforced

779
0:40:07,780 --> 0:40:10,340
 by the underlying system.

780
0:40:10,340 --> 0:40:11,900
 I think that's great.

781
0:40:11,900 --> 0:40:15,480
 It's not perfect, so you can think about some improvements.

782
0:40:15,480 --> 0:40:16,620
 I haven't implemented this.

783
0:40:16,620 --> 0:40:18,740
 That's a possible improvement to do that.

784
0:40:18,740 --> 0:40:22,680
 And also, just to have a list of all currently

785
0:40:22,680 --> 0:40:27,000
 active facts, like Babeson kind of to the right in the menu,

786
0:40:27,000 --> 0:40:29,700
 such that you don't forget how the world currently works.

787
0:40:29,700 --> 0:40:32,400
 That will fail if there are too many facts, but in most games,

788
0:40:32,400 --> 0:40:35,940
 it should be mostly like some not too many.

789
0:40:38,600 --> 0:40:40,460
 You want to have more than two players.

790
0:40:40,460 --> 0:40:42,360
 Two players is technically multiplayer,

791
0:40:42,360 --> 0:40:46,560
 but you should be able to handle any number of players.

792
0:40:46,560 --> 0:40:49,120
 Maybe make a library of reusable facts.

793
0:40:49,120 --> 0:40:51,740
 There are many concepts that I think should be common,

794
0:40:51,740 --> 0:40:52,300
 like locations.

795
0:40:52,300 --> 0:40:58,120
 And walking between them.

796
0:40:58,120 --> 0:40:59,760
 You should have some dice rolls.

797
0:40:59,760 --> 0:41:01,080
 That's a part of any game.

798
0:41:01,080 --> 0:41:03,120
 Some randomness.

799
0:41:03,120 --> 0:41:08,460
 And it could also be nice to encode the flavor text

800
0:41:08,460 --> 0:41:12,100
 inside the facts that have been introduced.

801
0:41:12,100 --> 0:41:15,000
 That requires more work, and it's probably not

802
0:41:15,000 --> 0:41:17,060
 super straightforward.

803
0:41:17,060 --> 0:41:19,940
 But it would make sure that whatever the game master

804
0:41:19,940 --> 0:41:21,840
 writes also has to be enforced.

805
0:41:21,840 --> 0:41:22,220
 Right?

806
0:41:22,220 --> 0:41:24,220
 by the facts that the game master provides.

807
0:41:26,620 --> 0:41:28,100
 I think to

808
0:41:28,100 --> 0:41:30,160
 cannot get rid of this lopsidedness,

809
0:41:30,220 --> 0:41:32,040
 you could also make it such that

810
0:41:32,040 --> 0:41:34,540
 the player and the game master

811
0:41:34,540 --> 0:41:38,440
 play two games at the same

812
0:41:38,440 --> 0:41:40,480
 time, such that they exist

813
0:41:40,480 --> 0:41:42,360
 in the same world and are affected by the

814
0:41:42,360 --> 0:41:44,280
 same facts, so

815
0:41:44,280 --> 0:41:46,080
 we reach some kind of balance. That would also

816
0:41:46,080 --> 0:41:48,320
 be more difficult if you have more than

817
0:41:48,320 --> 0:41:50,200
 two players, but you should be able to engineer

818
0:41:50,200 --> 0:41:50,620
 something.

819
0:41:52,220 --> 0:41:54,180
 Okay, so the next and final topic

820
0:41:54,180 --> 0:41:56,120
 is applications of

821
0:41:56,120 --> 0:41:58,360
 these simulation things that I have talked about

822
0:41:58,360 --> 0:42:00,220
 in non-interactive fiction.

823
0:42:00,940 --> 0:42:02,300
 So I'm thinking about books,

824
0:42:03,160 --> 0:42:03,660
 films,

825
0:42:04,560 --> 0:42:06,400
 theater, you name it.

826
0:42:06,820 --> 0:42:08,280
 Anything that doesn't require

827
0:42:08,280 --> 0:42:10,620
 interactive

828
0:42:10,620 --> 0:42:12,060
 action from a user.

829
0:42:13,540 --> 0:42:14,700
 So let's see.

830
0:42:15,680 --> 0:42:16,600
 I want to talk

831
0:42:16,600 --> 0:42:17,200
 about

832
0:42:17,200 --> 0:42:20,620
 yes, the other day

833
0:42:20,620 --> 0:42:22,200
 I was walking

834
0:42:22,200 --> 0:42:23,000
 this nice dog.

835
0:42:24,380 --> 0:42:26,100
 I couldn't decide which picture

836
0:42:26,100 --> 0:42:28,260
 to show here, so that's a couple of

837
0:42:28,260 --> 0:42:34,060
 Oh, yeah.

838
0:42:34,600 --> 0:42:36,220
 So I was walking this dog, and

839
0:42:36,220 --> 0:42:37,740
 I meet someone on the street

840
0:42:37,740 --> 0:42:40,180
 who just starts talking to me.

841
0:42:41,000 --> 0:42:41,640
 This happens,

842
0:42:42,260 --> 0:42:44,400
 and he mentions

843
0:42:44,400 --> 0:42:44,940
 that

844
0:42:44,940 --> 0:42:48,000
 he also knew a dog like this,

845
0:42:48,700 --> 0:42:50,460
 and the owners of that dog

846
0:42:50,460 --> 0:42:52,180
 moved to New York.

847
0:42:52,200 --> 0:42:52,640
 New Zealand,

848
0:42:53,640 --> 0:42:56,140
 because they were producing hearing aids,

849
0:42:56,540 --> 0:42:58,600
 and hearing aids are quite big in New Zealand,

850
0:42:58,740 --> 0:42:59,300
 he told me.

851
0:43:00,360 --> 0:43:02,280
 And that was like, okay, fair enough.

852
0:43:02,920 --> 0:43:04,340
 Then he went on to tell me

853
0:43:04,340 --> 0:43:04,780
 that

854
0:43:04,780 --> 0:43:07,800
 he just got a girlfriend

855
0:43:07,800 --> 0:43:10,280
 who is a model, and knows

856
0:43:10,280 --> 0:43:12,060
 another model. And I thought,

857
0:43:12,260 --> 0:43:14,060
 okay, interesting, but

858
0:43:14,060 --> 0:43:15,960
 what does this have to do with anything,

859
0:43:16,080 --> 0:43:17,160
 and why are you talking to me?

860
0:43:18,440 --> 0:43:20,260
 So at this point, he had kind of provided

861
0:43:20,260 --> 0:43:21,980
 me with different backstories,

862
0:43:22,200 --> 0:43:24,340
 and I was very eager to get to

863
0:43:24,340 --> 0:43:26,340
 the punchline, the conclusion

864
0:43:26,340 --> 0:43:27,060
 of this story.

865
0:43:28,960 --> 0:43:30,440
 And he just kept talking,

866
0:43:30,700 --> 0:43:31,440
 and I was just like,

867
0:43:31,720 --> 0:43:33,680
 what is the conclusion?

868
0:43:35,020 --> 0:43:36,160
 It was also awkward,

869
0:43:36,240 --> 0:43:38,380
 because I couldn't really participate in this conversation,

870
0:43:38,520 --> 0:43:40,080
 because I didn't know

871
0:43:40,080 --> 0:43:42,020
 New Zealand models really well.

872
0:43:43,760 --> 0:43:44,260
 And then he

873
0:43:44,260 --> 0:43:46,200
 says that I want to take my girlfriend

874
0:43:46,200 --> 0:43:48,100
 to New Zealand. And I thought,

875
0:43:48,300 --> 0:43:50,220
 well, technically, these

876
0:43:50,220 --> 0:43:51,920
 facts are connected,

877
0:43:52,200 --> 0:43:54,420
 but there's no immediate narrative

878
0:43:54,420 --> 0:43:56,360
 link from

879
0:43:56,360 --> 0:43:58,360
 the above facts to the

880
0:43:58,360 --> 0:44:00,600
 final conclusion. It was so confusing

881
0:44:00,600 --> 0:44:02,040
 for me, and I just went home,

882
0:44:02,340 --> 0:44:04,340
 and I was just confused for the rest of the day,

883
0:44:04,500 --> 0:44:04,800
 because

884
0:44:04,800 --> 0:44:07,480
 let's try to make a diagram.

885
0:44:08,580 --> 0:44:10,320
 So the facts are that he has a

886
0:44:10,320 --> 0:44:11,880
 girlfriend who is a model,

887
0:44:12,340 --> 0:44:14,260
 and has a friend who is also a model.

888
0:44:15,440 --> 0:44:16,140
 New Zealand

889
0:44:16,140 --> 0:44:18,260
 has at least one Siberian husky dog,

890
0:44:18,260 --> 0:44:19,200
 which is

891
0:44:19,200 --> 0:44:21,940
 okay,

892
0:44:22,360 --> 0:44:23,880
 there's some error in the diagram.

893
0:44:23,880 --> 0:44:25,820
 But New Zealand has many hearing aids.

894
0:44:26,200 --> 0:44:27,060
 That's what we know, right?

895
0:44:29,460 --> 0:44:30,360
 So the goal

896
0:44:30,360 --> 0:44:31,360
 that he presented was,

897
0:44:31,800 --> 0:44:34,120
 he wanted to take his girlfriend to New Zealand

898
0:44:34,120 --> 0:44:35,880
 for some reason. And this

899
0:44:35,880 --> 0:44:37,920
 is the narrative jump that

900
0:44:37,920 --> 0:44:39,520
 he presented that I did not understand.

901
0:44:40,180 --> 0:44:40,760
 And I thought,

902
0:44:41,780 --> 0:44:43,660
 maybe if you try to

903
0:44:43,660 --> 0:44:45,640
 generalize this, so why would you like

904
0:44:45,640 --> 0:44:47,640
 to take a person to a location?

905
0:44:48,200 --> 0:44:49,620
 That's because maybe

906
0:44:49,880 --> 0:44:51,920
 person is from location, so it could be

907
0:44:51,920 --> 0:44:54,120
 that his girlfriend was from New Zealand,

908
0:44:54,120 --> 0:44:56,720
 but then why did he talk about dogs?

909
0:44:56,720 --> 0:44:59,060
 Because I kind of imagined that, OK, you

910
0:44:59,060 --> 0:45:00,960
 need to use all these background facts

911
0:45:00,960 --> 0:45:03,040
 and tie them nicely together at the end.

912
0:45:03,040 --> 0:45:06,000
 So the other option is that New Zealand has

913
0:45:06,000 --> 0:45:07,640
 some kind of nice attribute.

914
0:45:07,640 --> 0:45:11,000
 For example, it has a dog, or it has hearing aids,

915
0:45:11,000 --> 0:45:15,260
 and you like hearing aids or dogs.

916
0:45:15,260 --> 0:45:16,640
 So that's kind of what I thought,

917
0:45:16,640 --> 0:45:19,980
 but none of it really made sense.

918
0:45:19,980 --> 0:45:25,140
 So I thought that was a nice way to think about things,

919
0:45:25,140 --> 0:45:27,580
 but it was also kind of a complicated story.

920
0:45:27,580 --> 0:45:35,620
 So I'm trying to present instead a simpler story now

921
0:45:35,620 --> 0:45:37,160
 to make it less complicated in order

922
0:45:37,160 --> 0:45:39,600
 to talk about what we actually are going to talk about.

923
0:45:39,600 --> 0:45:45,220
 So my simpler story is we have a human who discovered fire.

924
0:45:45,220 --> 0:45:49,500
 The human learned that the fire improves the food.

925
0:45:49,500 --> 0:45:52,980
 Then the human accidentally burned himself to a crisp.

926
0:45:52,980 --> 0:45:55,260
 And the final step, which is the twist,

927
0:45:55,260 --> 0:45:59,560
 is that the human was eaten by a hungry horse.

928
0:45:59,560 --> 0:46:01,920
 So we have this four-step story.

929
0:46:01,920 --> 0:46:06,100
 And as before, we can try to put it in a diagram.

930
0:46:06,100 --> 0:46:09,400
 So we have at the top kind of the conclusion.

931
0:46:09,400 --> 0:46:10,940
 The human was eaten by a hungry horse.

932
0:46:10,940 --> 0:46:14,880
 And then there are several links to earlier facts from that.

933
0:46:14,880 --> 0:46:19,100
 So he was eaten because he is food.

934
0:46:19,100 --> 0:46:23,960
 And he was eaten by the horse because the human is good food.

935
0:46:23,960 --> 0:46:28,360
 Because the fire improves the food, which is in this case

936
0:46:28,360 --> 0:46:29,080
 the human.

937
0:46:29,080 --> 0:46:31,500
 And this is known because the human discovered fire.

938
0:46:31,500 --> 0:46:34,640
 And it's known specifically because we are kind

939
0:46:34,640 --> 0:46:36,380
 of the all-knowing reader.

940
0:46:36,380 --> 0:46:39,300
 So in the story, only the human technically knows this.

941
0:46:39,300 --> 0:46:43,660
 But also, if you read the story, you also know that.

942
0:46:43,660 --> 0:46:48,160
 So on the left side, we have that the human burned themselves

943
0:46:48,160 --> 0:46:48,900
 to a crisp.

944
0:46:48,900 --> 0:46:50,900
 And it's possible because the human discovered fire.

945
0:46:50,900 --> 0:46:53,020
 So this is kind of a high-level diagram of the story

946
0:46:53,020 --> 0:46:55,660
 containing the four points.

947
0:46:55,660 --> 0:46:59,820
 But we have to make it more precise in order

948
0:46:59,820 --> 0:47:05,860
 to kind of think about any underlying generalized things.

949
0:47:05,860 --> 0:47:09,780
 So let's try to remove some of the weird English things

950
0:47:09,780 --> 0:47:13,760
 about articles and past and present.

951
0:47:13,760 --> 0:47:16,800
 Just make the sentence simpler.

952
0:47:16,800 --> 0:47:18,860
 I have a nice diagram here where we've kind of, you know,

953
0:47:18,860 --> 0:47:22,060
 kind of say that a horse eats the human.

954
0:47:22,060 --> 0:47:25,420
 And the horse specifically eats because it's hungry.

955
0:47:25,420 --> 0:47:26,800
 And it specifically eats the human

956
0:47:26,800 --> 0:47:28,100
 because the human is good food.

957
0:47:28,100 --> 0:47:31,460
 And the food is good because the fire improves the food, which

958
0:47:31,460 --> 0:47:33,620
 is known because the human discovered the fire.

959
0:47:33,620 --> 0:47:37,620
 And we can extend this diagram work in even more fine grains

960
0:47:37,620 --> 0:47:40,280
 by having some more arrows around and saying

961
0:47:40,280 --> 0:47:42,840
 that the human is dead because the human used the fire

962
0:47:42,840 --> 0:47:44,180
 to burn the human to death.

963
0:47:44,180 --> 0:47:47,960
 And we can also say that discovering fire is kind of

964
0:47:47,960 --> 0:47:50,300
 similar to learning about something.

965
0:47:50,300 --> 0:47:53,620
 So let's try to use fewer kind of verbs.

966
0:47:53,620 --> 0:47:59,540
 So we just say that discover and learn is the same word.

967
0:47:59,540 --> 0:48:03,720
 But this diagram is still kind of not super useful on its own.

968
0:48:03,720 --> 0:48:05,660
 So we should go back to our prologue

969
0:48:05,660 --> 0:48:13,100
 and try to make it nice and text-based as we like it.

970
0:48:13,100 --> 0:48:16,580
 So we should have simple textual encodings of the background

971
0:48:16,580 --> 0:48:17,580
 facts.

972
0:48:17,960 --> 0:48:30,920
 of our story so I made something oh the website loaded that's nice so let's go

973
0:48:30,920 --> 0:48:39,980
 to this one so I wrote some prolog and let's try to make some queries so I

974
0:48:39,980 --> 0:48:47,900
 won't go into detail with this specific file but what we have here is again

975
0:48:47,900 --> 0:48:52,500
 this possible thing which tells us what action is possible during according to

976
0:48:52,500 --> 0:48:58,040
 what state we are currently in and some other background things that we need to

977
0:48:58,040 --> 0:49:05,540
 know so the first step to replicate so we want to replicate the story that we

978
0:49:05,540 --> 0:49:10,680
 provided so the first step that is to state that we have a human which is

979
0:49:10,680 --> 0:49:17,900
 alive oh sorry so we have to actually do it in here

980
0:49:17,900 --> 0:49:24,820
 and the next thing is the first sentence of the story was that we make

981
0:49:24,820 --> 0:49:34,920
 this subject verb object where we say human learn file that's our simplified

982
0:49:34,920 --> 0:49:42,760
 English version oh again I am entering it in the wrong place so now that is a

983
0:49:42,760 --> 0:49:47,900
 fact and then what we want to do the next fact is

984
0:49:47,900 --> 0:49:56,480
 this subject verb order of human learns and then the human this is the point

985
0:49:56,480 --> 0:50:00,560
 where the human learns that the fire improves the food so to encode that in

986
0:50:00,560 --> 0:50:05,540
 our product system we say that human learn that we make a new subject verb

987
0:50:05,540 --> 0:50:16,340
 object that fire improve food but instead of just entering this we have to

988
0:50:16,340 --> 0:50:17,660
 make sure that it's

989
0:50:17,900 --> 0:50:25,540
 possible according to our system. So we query the system, say possible, and says that's

990
0:50:25,540 --> 0:50:33,420
 true. Okay, so that's nice. So we can enter that again because it's okay. Then the next

991
0:50:33,420 --> 0:50:39,020
 thing that happened in the story was that the human burned themselves to a crisp and

992
0:50:39,020 --> 0:50:42,780
 there are so many details and flavors to that specific sentence, but we are simplifying

993
0:50:42,780 --> 0:50:52,460
 it and saying that subject, verb, object, human, burn, human. So we want to say, is

994
0:50:52,460 --> 0:51:02,680
 this possible? And it's it. But what if, so what if we hadn't introduced this fact before

995
0:51:02,680 --> 0:51:08,420
 that the human learned that fire improves the food? No, specifically this first one,

996
0:51:08,420 --> 0:51:12,060
 that the human learns the concept of fire. Let's try to comment that out.

997
0:51:12,780 --> 0:51:19,460
 What is the comment? Status. So now we have commented out the first part of the story

998
0:51:19,460 --> 0:51:25,500
 where the human learns the concept of fire. And then we try again to check if the third

999
0:51:25,500 --> 0:51:31,740
 option, the third thing is doable, that the human burns themselves and it's false. So

1000
0:51:31,740 --> 0:51:38,240
 we have enforced through our system of facts in Prolog that we cannot make any continuity

1001
0:51:38,240 --> 0:51:42,740
 errors. So let's go back to this and then let's enter this new.

1002
0:51:42,780 --> 0:51:50,160
 Fact to our system. And then the final thing that happened, no, the next to final. No,

1003
0:51:50,160 --> 0:51:59,440
 the final thing was that. Uh, the human dies, right? You can say, is it possible that subject

1004
0:51:59,440 --> 0:52:08,860
 verb human dies? That is possible because the human has burned themselves. So again,

1005
0:52:08,860 --> 0:52:09,780
 if we try to comment this out and try to again, we have to say, is it possible that the subject

1006
0:52:09,780 --> 0:52:10,780
 verb human dies?

1007
0:52:10,780 --> 0:52:11,780
 No, the next to final. No, the final. The final thing was that the human dies. So again,

1008
0:52:11,780 --> 0:52:12,780
 if we try to comment this out and try to again, we have enforced through our system of facts

1009
0:52:12,780 --> 0:52:13,780
 in Prolog to the human dies. You can say, is it possible that subject verb human dies?

1010
0:52:13,780 --> 0:52:14,780
 That is possible because the subject verb human dies. No, the next to final. No, the next

1011
0:52:14,780 --> 0:52:15,780
 to final. No, the next to final. No, the next to the human dies. No, the next to final.

1012
0:52:15,780 --> 0:52:16,780
 We have to do it again in the current scenario where you can query the human dies. That it's

1013
0:52:16,780 --> 0:52:19,780
 not possible because the human can only die if the human has burned themselves or some

1014
0:52:19,780 --> 0:52:29,820
 other underlying facts. So we have it up here that, uh, that there are many ways to die.

1015
0:52:29,820 --> 0:52:36,400
 Uh, and you can say that you can die. If you're currently alive and you are now very old,

1016
0:52:36,400 --> 0:52:40,420
 you can die if you are currently alive and you are sick, or you can die if you're currently

1017
0:52:40,420 --> 0:52:41,780
 alive and someone burned you.

1018
0:52:41,780 --> 0:52:44,820
 someone burned you, in this case, yourself.

1019
0:52:44,820 --> 0:52:49,000
 So we are describing how to die in this world.

1020
0:52:49,000 --> 0:52:52,920
 So let's have that as well as a fact now,

1021
0:52:52,920 --> 0:52:57,300
 now that we know that this is okay, this is possible.

1022
0:52:57,300 --> 0:53:02,300
 And then let's state that we have a horse also who is alive.

1023
0:53:03,400 --> 0:53:08,060
 And then the final part of the story is to check

1024
0:53:08,060 --> 0:53:12,920
 whether it is possible for subject, verb, object,

1025
0:53:12,920 --> 0:53:15,820
 the horse, to eat the human.

1026
0:53:20,040 --> 0:53:22,500
 Oh yeah, so this is not possible.

1027
0:53:22,500 --> 0:53:23,340
 And why is that?

1028
0:53:23,340 --> 0:53:25,660
 That's because we haven't introduced the fact

1029
0:53:25,660 --> 0:53:27,080
 that the horse is hungry.

1030
0:53:27,080 --> 0:53:30,560
 So the horse can only eat people if it's hungry.

1031
0:53:30,560 --> 0:53:31,720
 So let's try again.

1032
0:53:31,720 --> 0:53:34,620
 Is it possible to eat the human now that it's hungry?

1033
0:53:34,620 --> 0:53:36,300
 And yes, it is.

1034
0:53:36,300 --> 0:53:38,020
 So we can encode that fact as well.

1035
0:53:38,060 --> 0:53:40,220
 And now we have completed our story.

1036
0:53:41,520 --> 0:53:44,740
 And for each new sentence that we wanted to add

1037
0:53:44,740 --> 0:53:48,200
 to this story, we made sure that it was not breaking

1038
0:53:48,200 --> 0:53:53,200
 any continuity, not breaking any facts about our world.

1039
0:53:53,500 --> 0:53:56,360
 And that's, I think, like a super great thing.

1040
0:53:56,360 --> 0:53:59,100
 I think you could use this for movie scripts and so on.

1041
0:54:00,660 --> 0:54:02,060
 You could support flashbacks.

1042
0:54:02,060 --> 0:54:04,000
 So my story was quite simple, right?

1043
0:54:04,000 --> 0:54:06,140
 Four steps, all in order.

1044
0:54:07,000 --> 0:54:07,840
 In modern,

1045
0:54:08,060 --> 0:54:09,120
 stories,

1046
0:54:09,120 --> 0:54:11,340
 you want to have maybe some switching around

1047
0:54:11,340 --> 0:54:14,340
 of time and place, flashbacks, flash-forwards.

1048
0:54:14,340 --> 0:54:16,320
 You could support that by extending our system

1049
0:54:16,320 --> 0:54:19,580
 to have like a predicate that says

1050
0:54:22,340 --> 0:54:24,380
 you have this,

1051
0:54:24,380 --> 0:54:27,500
 you have some kind of reverse where you take the order

1052
0:54:27,500 --> 0:54:29,180
 in a different order,

1053
0:54:29,180 --> 0:54:31,180
 and but you maintain the same facts

1054
0:54:31,180 --> 0:54:32,420
 and the same relations with them

1055
0:54:32,420 --> 0:54:35,920
 and make that equivalent with something in the original order.

1056
0:54:35,920 --> 0:54:37,020
 I think that's doable.

1057
0:54:38,060 --> 0:54:43,060
 So that's kind of what I thought about.

1058
0:54:43,060 --> 0:54:46,300
 In the end here now, I want to talk about

1059
0:54:46,300 --> 0:54:48,340
 some other applications for this.

1060
0:54:48,340 --> 0:54:50,620
 Machine learning, I didn't take the statistics course

1061
0:54:50,620 --> 0:54:54,460
 at my university because it seemed difficult,

1062
0:54:54,460 --> 0:54:57,740
 but I think machine learning has gone quite a long way

1063
0:54:57,740 --> 0:55:01,200
 and it's possible to use it quite easily,

1064
0:55:01,200 --> 0:55:02,220
 I think, at this point.

1065
0:55:02,220 --> 0:55:04,740
 So I wanted to do something that's this WordNet,

1066
0:55:04,740 --> 0:55:07,120
 which has relations between words, and I wanted to,

1067
0:55:07,120 --> 0:55:11,640
 I wanted to create a system that explores character attributes

1068
0:55:11,640 --> 0:55:13,460
 and presents you, the creator,

1069
0:55:13,460 --> 0:55:18,460
 with different kind of scenarios for your characters

1070
0:55:18,620 --> 0:55:20,360
 and different choices based on those scenarios,

1071
0:55:20,360 --> 0:55:22,040
 and then you have to pick the choice,

1072
0:55:22,040 --> 0:55:25,540
 and then the system generates character traits

1073
0:55:25,540 --> 0:55:28,300
 based on those automatically generated choices.

1074
0:55:28,300 --> 0:55:29,960
 So you define the character,

1075
0:55:29,960 --> 0:55:32,240
 but you are defining it by throwing the character

1076
0:55:32,240 --> 0:55:33,640
 into unknown situations.

1077
0:55:34,660 --> 0:55:37,120
 And I also would like to just experiment,

1078
0:55:37,120 --> 0:55:39,680
 and I would like to try to use these applications

1079
0:55:39,680 --> 0:55:42,960
 on real movie scripts, try to encode those properly.

1080
0:55:42,960 --> 0:55:44,960
 That could be fun, but also lots of work.

1081
0:55:46,340 --> 0:55:49,600
 Finally, some free ideas for game topics.

1082
0:55:50,600 --> 0:55:52,460
 I went to the Baker once, and then they asked me

1083
0:55:52,460 --> 0:55:54,540
 if I wanted a voucher, and I didn't really respond.

1084
0:55:54,540 --> 0:55:55,560
 It was kind of confusing.

1085
0:55:55,560 --> 0:55:56,460
 Maybe that's a game.

1086
0:55:56,460 --> 0:55:58,580
 Also, I was at the cinema watching a movie,

1087
0:55:58,580 --> 0:56:00,060
 and then this random dude talked to me,

1088
0:56:00,060 --> 0:56:01,300
 and I didn't know how to respond.

1089
0:56:01,300 --> 0:56:02,340
 Maybe that's a game.

1090
0:56:02,340 --> 0:56:05,140
 And also, I have this concept of having too many

1091
0:56:05,140 --> 0:56:06,600
 side projects and never finishing any of them.

1092
0:56:06,600 --> 0:56:06,620
 And I thought, well, maybe I should do this.

1093
0:56:06,620 --> 0:56:07,380
 And I thought, well, maybe I should do this.

1094
0:56:07,380 --> 0:56:09,540
 So maybe the game, you would have,

1095
0:56:09,540 --> 0:56:12,880
 the goal would be to finish just one side project,

1096
0:56:12,880 --> 0:56:17,000
 and then you would have constant things coming in your way,

1097
0:56:17,000 --> 0:56:19,180
 kind of stopping you, and that could be fun.

1098
0:56:19,440 --> 0:56:20,920
 Also, what about an inverse game

1099
0:56:20,920 --> 0:56:25,440
 where the game is presenting you with parser input,

1100
0:56:25,700 --> 0:56:26,840
 and then you have to respond,

1101
0:56:27,320 --> 0:56:29,280
 and then something else exciting happens.

1102
0:56:30,160 --> 0:56:32,540
 In conclusion, I think the main degrees of freedom

1103
0:56:32,540 --> 0:56:34,220
 that I'm interested in is this,

1104
0:56:34,640 --> 0:56:36,600
 either it's parser-based or it's choice-based,

1105
0:56:36,620 --> 0:56:41,340
 either it's a static graph of choices or it's a simulation,

1106
0:56:41,340 --> 0:56:42,860
 or either it's single-player or multiplayer.

1107
0:56:42,860 --> 0:56:47,360
 And I am probably picking a list of choices,

1108
0:56:47,360 --> 0:56:49,540
 a simulation, and single-player.

1109
0:56:49,540 --> 0:56:52,340
 I think that's what the game I'm making will be.

1110
0:56:53,700 --> 0:56:56,060
 I think text-only development is great,

1111
0:56:56,060 --> 0:56:57,720
 because game development should have

1112
0:56:57,720 --> 0:56:59,740
 as few obstacles as possible,

1113
0:56:59,740 --> 0:57:01,860
 and making graphics is time-consuming.

1114
0:57:01,860 --> 0:57:06,100
 I think writing is fun, so it's fun to make the game.

1115
0:57:06,620 --> 0:57:11,340
 And it's easy to really do effective,

1116
0:57:11,340 --> 0:57:14,780
 iterative development, because you can just move text around,

1117
0:57:14,780 --> 0:57:17,100
 and you can have systems in place that's guarantee

1118
0:57:17,100 --> 0:57:18,940
 that you're not doing something that is invalid

1119
0:57:18,940 --> 0:57:21,820
 within the game world that you're trying to define.

1120
0:57:24,340 --> 0:57:25,740
 Yes, thank you.

1121
0:57:33,680 --> 0:57:34,420
 Thank you very much.

1122
0:57:34,420 --> 0:57:36,060
 Do we have any questions for Nils?

1123
0:57:36,620 --> 0:57:41,620
 Oh, there's one all the way down there.

1124
0:57:47,620 --> 0:57:51,300
 Could you have Prologue say that the horse needed to be hungry

1125
0:57:51,300 --> 0:57:56,300
 to enable a solution at that point?

1126
0:57:56,940 --> 0:57:57,780
 Yes.

1127
0:58:02,380 --> 0:58:03,220
 Yes, indeed.

1128
0:58:03,220 --> 0:58:04,680
 You can just say that

1129
0:58:06,620 --> 0:58:11,280
 this particular state of horse is hungry,

1130
0:58:11,280 --> 0:58:13,460
 that state can...

1131
0:58:13,460 --> 0:58:16,380
 You can make it even more complicated.

1132
0:58:16,380 --> 0:58:19,380
 You can say that state can only exist

1133
0:58:19,380 --> 0:58:22,480
 if we introduce a concept of time,

1134
0:58:22,480 --> 0:58:25,720
 and there has been so and so much time

1135
0:58:25,720 --> 0:58:28,020
 since the horse last ate,

1136
0:58:28,020 --> 0:58:30,580
 such that we don't have this explicit state,

1137
0:58:30,580 --> 0:58:33,820
 but we have a set of actions describing

1138
0:58:33,820 --> 0:58:35,620
 what actions the horse did in the last 24 hours, and if it didn't, then it's gone.

1139
0:58:35,620 --> 0:58:36,180
 So, I think that's a good point. I think that's a good point.

1140
0:58:36,180 --> 0:58:40,300
 And if it didn't eat as part of any of its actions,

1141
0:58:40,300 --> 0:58:42,980
 that would constitute it being hungry.

1142
0:58:42,980 --> 0:58:44,540
 I didn't respond to your question, I'm sorry.

1143
0:58:44,540 --> 0:58:45,620
 I just thought of something else.

1144
0:58:45,620 --> 0:58:47,420
 But yes, for sure you could do that,

1145
0:58:47,420 --> 0:58:49,220
 and you could do so many more things.

1146
0:58:51,100 --> 0:58:53,940
 Do we have any other questions?

1147
0:58:53,940 --> 0:58:56,060
 Then let's give a big round of applause for Nils.
