 If you are anything like me, when you want to cook something at home,

2
0:00:19,180 --> 0:00:28,080
 you visit your favorite search engine and just type in something like chili con carne.

3
0:00:28,080 --> 0:00:30,620
 If that's what you want.

4
0:00:31,100 --> 0:00:39,380
 And then you typically end up on the same food blog where you have the recipe

5
0:00:39,380 --> 0:00:43,940
 that someone who made the blog think is good.

6
0:00:45,220 --> 0:00:50,440
 And if you have made it a couple of times, then you might have some changes to the recipe yourself.

7
0:00:50,440 --> 0:00:57,120
 Maybe you always add in a smidge of something or change some ingredient up

8
0:00:57,120 --> 0:00:57,440
 with something.

9
0:00:58,080 --> 0:00:58,700
 Or something else.

10
0:01:00,800 --> 0:01:04,860
 And, of course, that's something that you can just remember.

11
0:01:05,300 --> 0:01:07,780
 But there are other ways to do it.

12
0:01:08,080 --> 0:01:13,700
 There is this tander or tandoor or what it's called.

13
0:01:13,700 --> 0:01:23,580
 And that's an open source application for cooking recipe management.

14
0:01:24,980 --> 0:01:27,700
 And, yeah, it's open source.

15
0:01:28,080 --> 0:01:29,720
 And you can host it yourself.

16
0:01:30,620 --> 0:01:35,920
 And you can also use a paid version if you live in Germany.

17
0:01:37,040 --> 0:01:45,940
 Something that it's the same product, but the guys that wrote tandoor just hosted the application for you.

18
0:01:47,420 --> 0:01:54,380
 And, yeah, I'm just going to show you the hosted version.

19
0:01:56,080 --> 0:01:56,520
 Okay.

20
0:01:57,280 --> 0:01:57,680
 Okay.

21
0:01:57,680 --> 0:01:57,720
 Okay.

22
0:01:57,720 --> 0:01:57,740
 Okay.

23
0:01:57,740 --> 0:01:57,760
 Okay.

24
0:01:57,760 --> 0:01:57,780
 Okay.

25
0:01:57,780 --> 0:01:57,800
 Okay.

26
0:01:57,800 --> 0:01:57,820
 Okay.

27
0:01:57,820 --> 0:01:57,840
 Okay.

28
0:01:57,840 --> 0:01:57,880
 Okay.

29
0:01:57,880 --> 0:01:57,900
 Okay.

30
0:01:57,900 --> 0:01:57,920
 Okay.

31
0:01:57,920 --> 0:01:57,940
 Okay.

32
0:01:58,080 --> 0:01:58,100
 Okay.

33
0:02:03,100 --> 0:02:03,980
 Okay.

34
0:02:08,300 --> 0:02:08,900
 Okay.

35
0:02:11,320 --> 0:02:11,360
 Okay.

36
0:02:11,360 --> 0:02:11,760
 Okay.

37
0:02:12,680 --> 0:02:12,900
 Okay.

38
0:02:13,260 --> 0:02:13,340
 Okay.

39
0:02:13,340 --> 0:02:13,680
 Okay.

40
0:02:27,680 --> 0:02:27,960
 Okay.

41
0:02:27,960 --> 0:02:28,040
 All right.

42
0:02:28,040 --> 0:02:45,080
 And, as you can see, you have all the ingredients, and it is already formatted like this one

43
0:02:45,080 --> 0:02:53,420
 tablespoon of something I don't know the name of in English, because this is a Danish recipe.

44
0:02:53,420 --> 0:03:01,120
 But, yeah, this makes it very easy to, oh, yeah, and the steps, that is markdown format,

45
0:03:01,300 --> 0:03:07,020
 if you know markdown, it's pretty easy to change that.

46
0:03:08,760 --> 0:03:09,440
 Yeah.

47
0:03:10,560 --> 0:03:20,900
 But when you have the ingredients like this in a nice data format, then you can start

48
0:03:20,900 --> 0:03:23,400
 using it for stuff like shearing.

49
0:03:23,420 --> 0:03:31,660
 You can add it to a shopping list, and you can just edit how many people that you have

50
0:03:31,660 --> 0:03:33,740
 invited for dinner or something like that.

51
0:03:36,080 --> 0:03:38,420
 And you can also create the meal plans.

52
0:03:39,500 --> 0:03:49,820
 For example, if I want to cook chili con carne on Tuesday, and we will be four persons, then

53
0:03:49,820 --> 0:03:53,360
 you can just put it in like this, and you can add it to a shopping list.

54
0:03:53,420 --> 0:04:04,140
 And this is nice, because if you have a lot of the same ingredients for different meals,

55
0:04:04,140 --> 0:04:08,920
 then it will just aggregate the amount of what you need.

56
0:04:08,920 --> 0:04:20,460
 But of course, you would want to use the same units, like if one recipe says that you need

57
0:04:20,460 --> 0:04:22,160
 100 ounces of something.

58
0:04:22,160 --> 0:04:23,160
 Yeah.

59
0:04:23,160 --> 0:04:34,680
 And if another recipe says that you need kilograms, then it won't get aggregated correctly.

60
0:04:34,680 --> 0:04:41,360
 So yeah, and of course, you would want to use the same language as well, because otherwise

61
0:04:41,360 --> 0:04:44,780
 it will not get aggregated.

62
0:04:44,780 --> 0:04:51,900
 So yeah, and this works on many different websites.

63
0:04:51,900 --> 0:05:03,420
 You can just look for lasagna as well, and all, yeah, just all recipes.

64
0:05:03,420 --> 0:05:09,300
 One looks like this.

65
0:05:09,300 --> 0:05:14,420
 Just take that as well, and plop it in here.

66
0:05:14,420 --> 0:05:15,420
 Yeah.

67
0:05:15,420 --> 0:05:17,420
 Oh, it goes up there.

68
0:05:17,420 --> 0:05:18,420
 Yeah.

69
0:05:18,420 --> 0:05:19,420
 Yeah.

70
0:05:19,420 --> 0:05:20,420
 Yeah.

71
0:05:20,420 --> 0:05:21,420
 Yeah.

72
0:05:21,420 --> 0:05:28,520
 We'll leave that there.

73
0:05:28,520 --> 0:05:37,540
 And you can see that it works with this one as well just fine.

74
0:05:37,540 --> 0:05:48,140
 And there might be some issues with some of the recipes, as you can see this one, too,

75
0:05:48,140 --> 0:05:48,940
 and then the...

76
0:05:48,940 --> 0:05:49,940
 There we go.

77
0:05:49,940 --> 0:06:03,320
 the unit is six and then ounce and cans over here so that doesn't really make sense so sometimes

78
0:06:03,320 --> 0:06:11,180
 there can be some passing errors that you have to correct like this is actually six cans and

79
0:06:11,180 --> 0:06:23,360
 then just remove what was that tomato paste and then that's fixed right okay and this works on

80
0:06:23,360 --> 0:06:30,020
 a lot of websites I haven't really come by any sites that doesn't work on and I was surprised

81
0:06:30,020 --> 0:06:40,500
 as how this worked and it turns out that there is a schema on schema dot org

82
0:06:41,180 --> 0:06:51,800
 I think this recipe and actually there's this standard structure for recipes cooking recipes

83
0:06:51,800 --> 0:07:00,120
 and that's not something that you see on the website but it is there in the HTML last

84
0:07:00,820 --> 0:07:10,480
 sides uses RDF H format and you can see why we had the error before because the recipe ingredient

85
0:07:10,480 --> 0:07:10,980
 is eight- rallied and it doesn't have to be all the way to the hamsaver again we hook it up to some

86
0:07:10,980 --> 0:07:11,060
 in RLDV anymore and there's the error here also one of theoten so we really want to clarify

87
0:07:11,060 --> 0:07:11,100
 what does this mean um I don't know any way that we can just show it and show it in the end so everything

88
0:07:11,100 --> 0:07:11,160
 here some Hannah marine ones showing on the other side you be all right and we've got to start maybe

89
0:07:11,160 --> 0:07:11,180
 we can actually let's have the same behavior one see here we've got a little delete and see here we go okay and motions

90
0:07:11,180 --> 0:07:19,060
 just a string it's not how many of some item it's just a string that has to be

91
0:07:19,060 --> 0:07:31,860
 passed yeah and I think that we can see for example what this website is using

92
0:07:31,860 --> 0:07:50,640
 and maybe recipe oh well it is these item props recipe ingredient that are parts of the schema

93
0:07:50,640 --> 0:07:59,940
 and you can see that they use the RDF age based on that format so that's basically how it works

94
0:07:59,940 --> 0:08:01,800
 yeah

95
0:08:01,860 --> 0:08:12,320
 it would be nice if there were some integration with if you use online shopping or something like

96
0:08:12,320 --> 0:08:19,980
 that where you could just copy the shopping list to some supermarket that you use but I haven't

97
0:08:19,980 --> 0:08:24,660
 found any integrations like that so you have to copy all the stuff over but at least it gets

98
0:08:24,660 --> 0:08:30,980
 aggregated for you so it makes it quite easy if you cook for like a week or two at a time

99
0:08:30,980 --> 0:08:31,820
 um

100
0:08:31,860 --> 0:08:32,600
 yeah

101
0:08:32,600 --> 0:08:33,700
 so

102
0:08:33,700 --> 0:08:35,200
 I think that's it

103
0:08:35,200 --> 0:08:37,920
 applause
