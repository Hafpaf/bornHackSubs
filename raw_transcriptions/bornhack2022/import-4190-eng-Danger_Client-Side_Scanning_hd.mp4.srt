0:00:00,000 --> 0:00:16,760
 The next presentation we have is Arma Rohn,

2
0:00:16,880 --> 0:00:20,260
 who's going to talk a bit about the danger of client-side scanning.

3
0:00:20,260 --> 0:00:22,640
 Let's give a round of applause for Arma Rohn.

4
0:00:26,860 --> 0:00:27,700
 Thank you.

5
0:00:27,700 --> 0:00:32,840
 The European Union is proposing something very bad,

6
0:00:33,420 --> 0:00:36,340
 and I'm going to tell you about it and why it's bad.

7
0:00:37,300 --> 0:00:39,240
 I am the one person presenting this,

8
0:00:39,320 --> 0:00:41,180
 but we've actually been talking about it in CryptoHagan,

9
0:00:41,500 --> 0:00:43,900
 so it's not just... I don't deserve all the credit.

10
0:00:45,560 --> 0:00:47,940
 So I don't really have slides,

11
0:00:48,080 --> 0:00:49,780
 but I will put the outline over here.

12
0:00:50,340 --> 0:00:51,260
 Oh, that didn't work so well.

13
0:00:52,260 --> 0:00:53,160
 Let's try it.

14
0:00:54,260 --> 0:00:55,880
 First is, I'm going to say,

15
0:00:56,620 --> 0:00:57,060
 proposal.

16
0:00:57,700 --> 0:00:59,040
 Second, why.

17
0:00:59,400 --> 0:01:03,840
 And third, like, things you could do.

18
0:01:05,180 --> 0:01:08,060
 So in the last, like, three years,

19
0:01:08,320 --> 0:01:10,820
 there have been proposals that are effectively, like,

20
0:01:11,180 --> 0:01:14,260
 we're going to surveil everyone more

21
0:01:14,260 --> 0:01:18,860
 in order to do something about child sexual abuse material

22
0:01:18,860 --> 0:01:21,160
 and the solicitation of children on the Internet

23
0:01:21,160 --> 0:01:23,720
 for sexual abuse.

24
0:01:24,720 --> 0:01:27,100
 And the first one is abbreviated,

25
0:01:27,340 --> 0:01:27,680
 CSA,

26
0:01:27,700 --> 0:01:29,620
 and the latter is abbreviated, grooming.

27
0:01:30,800 --> 0:01:32,660
 So these are, like, bad things,

28
0:01:33,000 --> 0:01:34,680
 and the proposal is we're going to surveil people more

29
0:01:34,680 --> 0:01:37,260
 so we can find these things and stop these things

30
0:01:37,260 --> 0:01:40,900
 and bring the perpetrators to justice.

31
0:01:41,940 --> 0:01:44,800
 There have been proposals in 2020 and 2021,

32
0:01:45,820 --> 0:01:49,240
 and they were both, like, people said they were bad,

33
0:01:49,380 --> 0:01:50,180
 and they didn't go anywhere.

34
0:01:51,080 --> 0:01:54,560
 And then 2022, in May, there was another proposal.

35
0:01:55,520 --> 0:01:56,560
 This proposal is number...

36
0:01:57,700 --> 0:02:05,980
 I'll have notes on the page for this presentation

37
0:02:05,980 --> 0:02:08,020
 so you can see everything that I'm saying

38
0:02:08,020 --> 0:02:11,160
 with all these references and links to papers and stuff.

39
0:02:11,860 --> 0:02:12,940
 But I'll put the key stuff here.

40
0:02:13,500 --> 0:02:17,620
 So this number proposal, it hasn't been passed,

41
0:02:18,120 --> 0:02:20,440
 would require that tech companies screen their platforms

42
0:02:20,440 --> 0:02:21,940
 for child sexual abuse material

43
0:02:21,940 --> 0:02:25,760
 and establish the EU Center on Child Sexual Abuse

44
0:02:25,760 --> 0:02:26,880
 to coordinate the screening.

45
0:02:27,700 --> 0:02:31,400
 And supposedly, these rules are supposed to rescue children

46
0:02:31,400 --> 0:02:34,340
 from abuse, prevent CSAM from reappearing online,

47
0:02:34,460 --> 0:02:35,660
 and to bring offenders to justice.

48
0:02:37,460 --> 0:02:42,420
 The proposal is quite vague about how it would be implemented.

49
0:02:43,340 --> 0:02:47,520
 So I'll tell you some things that could be related

50
0:02:47,520 --> 0:02:48,740
 that already exist.

51
0:02:52,820 --> 0:02:53,460
 There's...

52
0:02:53,460 --> 0:02:56,620
 So one technique that I suspect would be used,

53
0:02:56,620 --> 0:02:57,620
 but...

54
0:02:57,700 --> 0:02:59,040
 might not be adequate,

55
0:02:59,560 --> 0:03:01,820
 would be to effectively...

56
0:03:01,820 --> 0:03:04,700
 We create a database of sexual abuse material,

57
0:03:05,000 --> 0:03:09,600
 and we compare every message on, like, Facebook or Signal

58
0:03:09,600 --> 0:03:13,240
 or whatever to this database.

59
0:03:13,240 --> 0:03:16,980
 And it would probably only work for images, so simply.

60
0:03:17,560 --> 0:03:20,160
 So a very simple way is you hash every known...

61
0:03:20,160 --> 0:03:22,860
 You have some, like, central party

62
0:03:22,860 --> 0:03:25,280
 that collects all the child sexual abuse material

63
0:03:25,280 --> 0:03:25,940
 that's been reported,

64
0:03:26,380 --> 0:03:27,700
 and it takes a hash,

65
0:03:27,700 --> 0:03:28,700
 and you take a hash of each image.

66
0:03:28,700 --> 0:03:29,700
 It could be, like, an MD5 hash.

67
0:03:29,700 --> 0:03:33,700
 And then on every client service,

68
0:03:33,700 --> 0:03:35,700
 you take an MD5 hash of every image that's ever shared,

69
0:03:35,700 --> 0:03:37,700
 as it's shared,

70
0:03:37,700 --> 0:03:38,700
 and you compare them,

71
0:03:38,700 --> 0:03:40,700
 and if there's a match,

72
0:03:40,700 --> 0:03:42,700
 you send it to Big Brother.

73
0:03:42,700 --> 0:03:44,700
 Um...

74
0:03:44,700 --> 0:03:45,700
 There...

75
0:03:45,700 --> 0:03:46,700
 There are...

76
0:03:46,700 --> 0:03:47,700
 I found...

77
0:03:47,700 --> 0:03:48,700
 I know two systems...

78
0:03:48,700 --> 0:03:51,700
 I found papers saying that two systems like this exist,

79
0:03:51,700 --> 0:03:52,700
 and I'm sure there are many more.

80
0:03:52,700 --> 0:03:56,460
 One I found is from the Canadian Center for Child Protection,

81
0:03:56,460 --> 0:03:57,560
 and another is from Apple.

82
0:03:57,560 --> 0:03:58,560
 And I'm sure there are others,

83
0:03:58,560 --> 0:04:02,560
 but these two I have linked to the...

84
0:04:02,560 --> 0:04:05,560
 some papers about them in case you want to read about them.

85
0:04:05,560 --> 0:04:09,560
 So one way you could do this is with, like, an MD5 hash.

86
0:04:09,560 --> 0:04:12,560
 You can also use what is called a perceptual hash function

87
0:04:12,560 --> 0:04:15,560
 so that if you have two images that are similar,

88
0:04:15,560 --> 0:04:17,560
 they will have similar hash values.

89
0:04:17,560 --> 0:04:19,560
 And that way, I guess, like,

90
0:04:19,560 --> 0:04:21,560
 if the image is resized or something,

91
0:04:21,560 --> 0:04:22,560
 you can, um...

92
0:04:22,560 --> 0:04:24,560
 I mean, the simple version, if it's resized,

93
0:04:24,560 --> 0:04:26,560
 you can match it, but also...

94
0:04:27,560 --> 0:04:29,560
 it can be a much more distant match.

95
0:04:29,560 --> 0:04:31,560
 And later I'll mention

96
0:04:31,560 --> 0:04:34,560
 you can have really bad false positives.

97
0:04:34,560 --> 0:04:36,560
 So, uh...

98
0:04:36,560 --> 0:04:37,560
 Still...

99
0:04:37,560 --> 0:04:39,560
 So, uh...

100
0:04:39,560 --> 0:04:40,560
 Like...

101
0:04:40,560 --> 0:04:43,560
 Probably, like, hacker people don't like this already,

102
0:04:43,560 --> 0:04:46,560
 but, you know, the people who like this say that this is good,

103
0:04:46,560 --> 0:04:47,560
 but we need more

104
0:04:47,560 --> 0:04:50,560
 because we're having more child sexual abuse material,

105
0:04:50,560 --> 0:04:53,560
 and we need more advanced methods than even perceptual hashing.

106
0:04:53,560 --> 0:04:56,560
 And this is where, like, artificial intelligence,

107
0:04:56,560 --> 0:04:59,560
 whatever that is, will come about.

108
0:04:59,560 --> 0:05:01,560
 But still, a system, an image-based system,

109
0:05:01,560 --> 0:05:05,560
 only works for detection of known...

110
0:05:05,560 --> 0:05:09,560
 probably known child sexual abuse material.

111
0:05:09,560 --> 0:05:11,560
 Maybe with some more advanced system,

112
0:05:11,560 --> 0:05:14,560
 we could detect, like, child sexual abuse material

113
0:05:14,560 --> 0:05:17,560
 that we didn't know about before.

114
0:05:17,560 --> 0:05:21,560
 Or maybe we could detect stuff that's happening by text,

115
0:05:21,560 --> 0:05:25,560
 such as solicitation for sexual activities, grooming.

116
0:05:26,560 --> 0:05:28,560
 Um...

117
0:05:28,560 --> 0:05:31,560
 And...

118
0:05:31,560 --> 0:05:33,560
 In practice,

119
0:05:33,560 --> 0:05:35,560
 like, the...

120
0:05:35,560 --> 0:05:38,560
 I don't think the regulation says

121
0:05:38,560 --> 0:05:40,560
 you need to have a human review this.

122
0:05:40,560 --> 0:05:42,560
 I guess it would be really scary to me

123
0:05:42,560 --> 0:05:44,560
 if they implemented this and there was no human review.

124
0:05:44,560 --> 0:05:46,560
 But because there's human review,

125
0:05:46,560 --> 0:05:47,560
 at some point,

126
0:05:47,560 --> 0:05:50,560
 someone's going to read your private communications

127
0:05:50,560 --> 0:05:52,560
 if there's a false positive.

128
0:05:52,560 --> 0:05:54,560
 So if, like, you have an image of your dog

129
0:05:54,560 --> 0:05:56,560
 that's marked as child sexual abuse,

130
0:05:56,560 --> 0:05:58,560
 or child sexual abuse material,

131
0:05:58,560 --> 0:06:00,560
 someone will...

132
0:06:00,560 --> 0:06:02,560
 Someone will have to review this image

133
0:06:02,560 --> 0:06:04,560
 and see that you took a picture of your dog.

134
0:06:04,560 --> 0:06:07,560
 And, um...

135
0:06:07,560 --> 0:06:08,560
 That's...

136
0:06:08,560 --> 0:06:12,560
 I think even if we have, like, MD5 as the hash function,

137
0:06:12,560 --> 0:06:14,560
 we will have false positives

138
0:06:14,560 --> 0:06:16,560
 because you can have legitimate purposes.

139
0:06:16,560 --> 0:06:19,560
 Like, if you're two organizations that, um...

140
0:06:19,560 --> 0:06:22,560
 are stop... trying to detect and stop

141
0:06:22,560 --> 0:06:24,560
 child sexual abuse material,

142
0:06:24,560 --> 0:06:26,560
 they might share images between each other.

143
0:06:26,560 --> 0:06:28,560
 So, um...

144
0:06:28,560 --> 0:06:30,560
 Even in that case, you're going to have false positives.

145
0:06:30,560 --> 0:06:32,560
 But if we use some complex artificial intelligence,

146
0:06:32,560 --> 0:06:34,560
 surely there's going to be a lot of false positives.

147
0:06:34,560 --> 0:06:36,560
 Um...

148
0:06:36,560 --> 0:06:38,560
 And...

149
0:06:38,560 --> 0:06:40,560
 One more point before...

150
0:06:40,560 --> 0:06:42,560
 Actually, no, I have a fun story on this last point.

151
0:06:42,560 --> 0:06:44,560
 I, um...

152
0:06:44,560 --> 0:06:46,560
 Years ago, I introduced two people

153
0:06:46,560 --> 0:06:48,560
 who happened to work on, um...

154
0:06:48,560 --> 0:06:50,560
 Like, stopping...

155
0:06:50,560 --> 0:06:52,560
 Like, detecting...

156
0:06:52,560 --> 0:06:54,560
 Uh...

157
0:06:54,560 --> 0:06:56,560
 Child sexual abuse material and other bad stuff.

158
0:06:56,560 --> 0:06:58,560
 And they were, like...

159
0:06:58,560 --> 0:07:00,560
 One of them had some really cool idea that the other one

160
0:07:00,560 --> 0:07:02,560
 really liked, and they wanted to share the information.

161
0:07:02,560 --> 0:07:04,560
 So the one sent an email to the other.

162
0:07:04,560 --> 0:07:06,560
 And I was standing right...

163
0:07:06,560 --> 0:07:08,560
 Like, I was sitting right with them.

164
0:07:08,560 --> 0:07:10,560
 And he said, okay, I'll send you the email,

165
0:07:10,560 --> 0:07:12,560
 but I'm not going to say what we were talking about.

166
0:07:12,560 --> 0:07:14,560
 So, like, even two people who are employed

167
0:07:14,560 --> 0:07:16,560
 in the business of, um...

168
0:07:16,560 --> 0:07:18,560
 Like, stopping child sexual abuse

169
0:07:18,560 --> 0:07:20,560
 can't say in their email

170
0:07:20,560 --> 0:07:22,560
 that that's what they're doing.

171
0:07:22,560 --> 0:07:24,560
 Um...

172
0:07:24,560 --> 0:07:26,560
 Anyway, uh... So...

173
0:07:26,560 --> 0:07:28,560
 Before I... So I'm still on the topic of

174
0:07:28,560 --> 0:07:30,560
 what is generally being proposed

175
0:07:30,560 --> 0:07:32,560
 and how it might be implemented.

176
0:07:32,560 --> 0:07:34,560
 Um... One more point on this.

177
0:07:34,560 --> 0:07:36,560
 I called the talk

178
0:07:36,560 --> 0:07:38,560
 Clydeside Scanning, and, um...

179
0:07:38,560 --> 0:07:40,560
 I don't really like the name.

180
0:07:40,560 --> 0:07:42,560
 Clydeside Scanning, um...

181
0:07:42,560 --> 0:07:44,560
 Means...

182
0:07:44,560 --> 0:07:46,560
 I'm going to scan...

183
0:07:46,560 --> 0:07:48,560
 Before you send...

184
0:07:48,560 --> 0:07:50,560
 I send you a message,

185
0:07:50,560 --> 0:07:52,560
 and before you receive the message,

186
0:07:52,560 --> 0:07:54,560
 some third party is going to scan it.

187
0:07:54,560 --> 0:07:56,560
 Uh...

188
0:07:56,560 --> 0:07:58,560
 Against... Like, compare it against the known

189
0:07:58,560 --> 0:08:00,560
 bad images. And...

190
0:08:00,560 --> 0:08:02,560
 That is one thing that would probably be part of this.

191
0:08:02,560 --> 0:08:04,560
 But there are many

192
0:08:04,560 --> 0:08:06,560
 other things that would be...

193
0:08:06,560 --> 0:08:08,560
 Um...

194
0:08:08,560 --> 0:08:10,560
 That could maybe accomplish this.

195
0:08:10,560 --> 0:08:12,560
 I think the Clydeside Scanning is particularly relevant

196
0:08:12,560 --> 0:08:14,560
 if we have end-to-end encryption, because...

197
0:08:14,560 --> 0:08:16,560
 If there's end-to-end encryption,

198
0:08:16,560 --> 0:08:18,560
 we need some way to...

199
0:08:18,560 --> 0:08:20,560
 Um...

200
0:08:20,560 --> 0:08:22,560
 Like...

201
0:08:22,560 --> 0:08:24,560
 Do the scanning while pretending to still maintain

202
0:08:24,560 --> 0:08:26,560
 the end-to-end encryption.

203
0:08:26,560 --> 0:08:28,560
 Um...

204
0:08:28,560 --> 0:08:30,560
 I wonder, did I, like, lose everyone?

205
0:08:30,560 --> 0:08:32,560
 Because I don't have slides and pretty pictures,

206
0:08:32,560 --> 0:08:34,560
 and maybe that helps.

207
0:08:34,560 --> 0:08:36,560
 Okay. Great. Thank you.

208
0:08:36,560 --> 0:08:38,560
 So I said I would do, uh...

209
0:08:38,560 --> 0:08:40,560
 Let's do this again.

210
0:08:40,560 --> 0:08:42,560
 I said I would do the...

211
0:08:42,560 --> 0:08:44,560
 What the proposal is.

212
0:08:44,560 --> 0:08:46,560
 Now I'm going into the Y...

213
0:08:46,560 --> 0:08:48,560
 The Y section of, like, uh...

214
0:08:48,560 --> 0:08:50,560
 Actually...

215
0:08:50,560 --> 0:08:52,560
 Oh, I actually have two Y sections.

216
0:08:52,560 --> 0:08:54,560
 I have why it's bad, and then why

217
0:08:54,560 --> 0:08:56,560
 people might have proposed such a bad thing.

218
0:08:56,560 --> 0:08:58,560
 And I'm going to start with why it's bad.

219
0:08:58,560 --> 0:09:00,560
 And I learned once that if you want to

220
0:09:00,560 --> 0:09:02,560
 convince people of something, you should do three things.

221
0:09:02,560 --> 0:09:04,560
 You should say... They're called in Greek...

222
0:09:04,560 --> 0:09:06,560
 I mean, I'm going to say it wrong.

223
0:09:06,560 --> 0:09:08,560
 Like, pathos...

224
0:09:08,560 --> 0:09:10,560
 Uh...

225
0:09:10,560 --> 0:09:12,560
 Logos and ethos, maybe?

226
0:09:12,560 --> 0:09:14,560
 One of them is logical arguments.

227
0:09:14,560 --> 0:09:16,560
 One of them is

228
0:09:16,560 --> 0:09:18,560
 some very emotional example.

229
0:09:18,560 --> 0:09:20,560
 And the other is some authority.

230
0:09:20,560 --> 0:09:22,560
 And I think people here care most about the first one,

231
0:09:22,560 --> 0:09:24,560
 but I hope the...

232
0:09:24,560 --> 0:09:26,560
 I won't bore you too much with the other two.

233
0:09:26,560 --> 0:09:28,560
 The logical reasons.

234
0:09:28,560 --> 0:09:30,560
 I think the privacy risk

235
0:09:30,560 --> 0:09:32,560
 is kind of clear.

236
0:09:32,560 --> 0:09:34,560
 And, uh...

237
0:09:34,560 --> 0:09:36,560
 Yes.

238
0:09:36,560 --> 0:09:38,560
 And at some point, like...

239
0:09:38,560 --> 0:09:40,560
 Well, yeah.

240
0:09:40,560 --> 0:09:42,560
 I pretty much already said that.

241
0:09:42,560 --> 0:09:44,560
 There's going to be false positives.

242
0:09:44,560 --> 0:09:46,560
 Someone's going to have to review it.

243
0:09:46,560 --> 0:09:48,560
 And, like, do you actually trust everyone in the...

244
0:09:48,560 --> 0:09:50,560
 Whoever, like...

245
0:09:50,560 --> 0:09:52,560
 It could be the EU center for whatever they're calling it.

246
0:09:52,560 --> 0:09:54,560
 Or it could be, like, any of these companies

247
0:09:54,560 --> 0:09:56,560
 that have to implement this.

248
0:09:56,560 --> 0:09:58,560
 They're reviewing it, and it's probably

249
0:09:58,560 --> 0:10:00,560
 not someone who, like...

250
0:10:00,560 --> 0:10:02,560
 It's probably not a very, uh...

251
0:10:02,560 --> 0:10:04,560
 You're going to need a lot of people reviewing it.

252
0:10:04,560 --> 0:10:06,560
 So I don't really trust that they're going to

253
0:10:06,560 --> 0:10:08,560
 do everything properly.

254
0:10:08,560 --> 0:10:10,560
 Um...

255
0:10:12,560 --> 0:10:14,560
 And...

256
0:10:14,560 --> 0:10:16,560
 Like...

257
0:10:16,560 --> 0:10:18,560
 If we have to scan...

258
0:10:18,560 --> 0:10:20,560
 If we have a communication between me and you,

259
0:10:20,560 --> 0:10:22,560
 and we're doing end-to-end encryption,

260
0:10:22,560 --> 0:10:24,560
 we can't do this.

261
0:10:24,560 --> 0:10:26,560
 There's a method of breaking the end-to-end encryption.

262
0:10:26,560 --> 0:10:28,560
 Like, one way to do it is we scan the image

263
0:10:28,560 --> 0:10:30,560
 on your laptop

264
0:10:30,560 --> 0:10:32,560
 before you encrypt it.

265
0:10:32,560 --> 0:10:34,560
 Another is there's some

266
0:10:34,560 --> 0:10:36,560
 master key that can decrypt your encryption.

267
0:10:36,560 --> 0:10:38,560
 Either way,

268
0:10:38,560 --> 0:10:40,560
 uh...

269
0:10:40,560 --> 0:10:42,560
 If you're going to follow the rule,

270
0:10:42,560 --> 0:10:44,560
 your end-to-end encryption is broken because

271
0:10:44,560 --> 0:10:46,560
 maybe there's a false positive.

272
0:10:46,560 --> 0:10:48,560
 I mean, if you're actually...

273
0:10:48,560 --> 0:10:50,560
 Of course, if you're actually, like, sharing child sexual abuse material,

274
0:10:50,560 --> 0:10:52,560
 the end-to-end encryption will be broken.

275
0:10:52,560 --> 0:10:54,560
 But if you're doing a false positive,

276
0:10:54,560 --> 0:10:56,560
 it's supposed to be broken.

277
0:10:56,560 --> 0:10:58,560
 So, um...

278
0:10:58,560 --> 0:11:00,560
 That's the, like,

279
0:11:00,560 --> 0:11:02,560
 freedom reasons.

280
0:11:02,560 --> 0:11:04,560
 But there are other reasons why it's bad.

281
0:11:04,560 --> 0:11:06,560
 First is, um...

282
0:11:08,560 --> 0:11:10,560
 It's not known

283
0:11:10,560 --> 0:11:12,560
 to be helpful for stopping

284
0:11:12,560 --> 0:11:14,560
 child sexual abuse.

285
0:11:16,560 --> 0:11:18,560
 Yes. So, um...

286
0:11:18,560 --> 0:11:20,560
 I... Two points

287
0:11:20,560 --> 0:11:22,560
 related to this. One is

288
0:11:22,560 --> 0:11:24,560
 this new fangled technique

289
0:11:24,560 --> 0:11:26,560
 is not shown to be effective.

290
0:11:26,560 --> 0:11:28,560
 Um...

291
0:11:28,560 --> 0:11:30,560
 And a specific reason why it's not...

292
0:11:30,560 --> 0:11:32,560
 Why, uh...

293
0:11:32,560 --> 0:11:34,560
 Okay, and then there's...

294
0:11:34,560 --> 0:11:36,560
 First, it's not known to be effective.

295
0:11:36,560 --> 0:11:38,560
 Now we can speculate why it won't be effective.

296
0:11:38,560 --> 0:11:40,560
 One reason it might not be effective

297
0:11:40,560 --> 0:11:42,560
 is that, according to

298
0:11:42,560 --> 0:11:44,560
 a board member at the

299
0:11:44,560 --> 0:11:46,560
 Child Protection Association of Germany,

300
0:11:46,560 --> 0:11:48,560
 Joachim Tschurk,

301
0:11:48,560 --> 0:11:50,560
 most illegal online activities

302
0:11:50,560 --> 0:11:52,560
 already occur via forums and the dark web.

303
0:11:52,560 --> 0:11:54,560
 And I do not think that the dark web

304
0:11:54,560 --> 0:11:56,560
 will implement this.

305
0:12:00,560 --> 0:12:02,560
 And then even if you implement it,

306
0:12:02,560 --> 0:12:04,560
 um... I mean, even if, like,

307
0:12:04,560 --> 0:12:06,560
 I'm a criminal and I'm gonna keep communicating

308
0:12:06,560 --> 0:12:08,560
 by some place that's gonna

309
0:12:08,560 --> 0:12:10,560
 implement it, maybe I can find a way

310
0:12:10,560 --> 0:12:12,560
 to work around it. Especially if it's...

311
0:12:12,560 --> 0:12:14,560
 If it's, like, implemented in something like

312
0:12:14,560 --> 0:12:16,560
 on the client application,

313
0:12:16,560 --> 0:12:18,560
 I can find a way around it, you know?

314
0:12:18,560 --> 0:12:20,560
 Um... So...

315
0:12:20,560 --> 0:12:22,560
 Yes. Not shown to be

316
0:12:22,560 --> 0:12:24,560
 effective. Good reason to think it won't be effective.

317
0:12:24,560 --> 0:12:26,560
 Also, there are already

318
0:12:26,560 --> 0:12:28,560
 effective methods.

319
0:12:28,560 --> 0:12:30,560
 And maybe we should just use them more.

320
0:12:30,560 --> 0:12:32,560
 So, like...

321
0:12:32,560 --> 0:12:34,560
 I found some, um...

322
0:12:34,560 --> 0:12:36,560
 articles about, like,

323
0:12:36,560 --> 0:12:38,560
 police say that they can't get

324
0:12:38,560 --> 0:12:40,560
 content like child sexual abuse material

325
0:12:40,560 --> 0:12:42,560
 removed, but if just some random

326
0:12:42,560 --> 0:12:44,560
 guy emails the service provider

327
0:12:44,560 --> 0:12:46,560
 and says, this is illegal,

328
0:12:46,560 --> 0:12:48,560
 remove it, the, um...

329
0:12:48,560 --> 0:12:50,560
 provider will remove it right away.

330
0:12:50,560 --> 0:12:52,560
 So... I don't...

331
0:12:52,560 --> 0:12:54,560
 Like, I didn't really look that much

332
0:12:54,560 --> 0:12:56,560
 into, um...

333
0:12:56,560 --> 0:12:58,560
 So I saw what the

334
0:12:58,560 --> 0:13:00,560
 guy wrote, but I didn't

335
0:13:00,560 --> 0:13:02,560
 check how correct it was. But there's

336
0:13:02,560 --> 0:13:04,560
 something about that.

337
0:13:04,560 --> 0:13:06,560
 Um... But also general...

338
0:13:06,560 --> 0:13:08,560
 Some other guy was writing,

339
0:13:08,560 --> 0:13:10,560
 like, just normal police work

340
0:13:10,560 --> 0:13:12,560
 works. You don't need this

341
0:13:12,560 --> 0:13:14,560
 mass surveillance.

342
0:13:14,560 --> 0:13:16,560
 Um...

343
0:13:16,560 --> 0:13:18,560
 Then...

344
0:13:18,560 --> 0:13:20,560
 So I said, the reasons

345
0:13:20,560 --> 0:13:22,560
 it's bad, it's bad for freedom,

346
0:13:22,560 --> 0:13:24,560
 it doesn't work,

347
0:13:24,560 --> 0:13:26,560
 it's also, um...

348
0:13:26,560 --> 0:13:28,560
 I said it breaks into

349
0:13:28,560 --> 0:13:30,560
 an encryption. It also creates a bunch of

350
0:13:30,560 --> 0:13:32,560
 new attacks.

351
0:13:32,560 --> 0:13:34,560
 Because, um...

352
0:13:34,560 --> 0:13:36,560
 I found a paper

353
0:13:36,560 --> 0:13:38,560
 that does this. You can read it in more detail.

354
0:13:38,560 --> 0:13:40,560
 And he went to, like...

355
0:13:40,560 --> 0:13:42,560
 Depending on how you implement it, there could be

356
0:13:42,560 --> 0:13:44,560
 different new attacks.

357
0:13:44,560 --> 0:13:46,560
 I, uh... You can imagine, like,

358
0:13:46,560 --> 0:13:48,560
 if you have some...

359
0:13:48,560 --> 0:13:50,560
 some master decryption key,

360
0:13:50,560 --> 0:13:52,560
 or if we have something running on the

361
0:13:52,560 --> 0:13:54,560
 clients,

362
0:13:54,560 --> 0:13:56,560
 there could be new attacks.

363
0:13:56,560 --> 0:13:58,560
 Well, the thing is

364
0:13:58,560 --> 0:14:00,560
 the proposal is vague

365
0:14:00,560 --> 0:14:02,560
 about what would be implemented, so you need

366
0:14:02,560 --> 0:14:04,560
 to have a bunch of different

367
0:14:04,560 --> 0:14:06,560
 um... possibilities

368
0:14:06,560 --> 0:14:08,560
 of what might be implemented, so that you can say

369
0:14:08,560 --> 0:14:10,560
 why they're all bad.

370
0:14:10,560 --> 0:14:12,560
 Okay, and then the last reason

371
0:14:12,560 --> 0:14:14,560
 why it's bad

372
0:14:14,560 --> 0:14:16,560
 is that children also need

373
0:14:16,560 --> 0:14:18,560
 privacy. So...

374
0:14:18,560 --> 0:14:20,560
 You're monitoring...

375
0:14:20,560 --> 0:14:22,560
 Like, the main thing is you're monitoring

376
0:14:22,560 --> 0:14:24,560
 if, like, a child is having a...

377
0:14:24,560 --> 0:14:26,560
 is being

378
0:14:26,560 --> 0:14:28,560
 solicited for sex or something.

379
0:14:28,560 --> 0:14:30,560
 Um...

380
0:14:30,560 --> 0:14:32,560
 And so you're scanning...

381
0:14:32,560 --> 0:14:34,560
 You're scanning everyone's message, but you're also scanning

382
0:14:34,560 --> 0:14:36,560
 the child's message to protect the child, but in doing this

383
0:14:36,560 --> 0:14:38,560
 you're reducing the privacy of the child.

384
0:14:40,560 --> 0:14:42,560
 So...

385
0:14:42,560 --> 0:14:44,560
 Those are some reasons

386
0:14:44,560 --> 0:14:46,560
 why it's bad. Now I'll give you

387
0:14:46,560 --> 0:14:48,560
 a practical example that will make you feel so emotional

388
0:14:48,560 --> 0:14:50,560
 to see why it's bad.

389
0:14:50,560 --> 0:14:52,560
 Uh, does anyone here use NN encryption?

390
0:14:54,560 --> 0:14:56,560
 Uh...

391
0:14:56,560 --> 0:14:58,560
 I think a lot of you use NN encryption, yeah.

392
0:14:58,560 --> 0:15:00,560
 Um, like...

393
0:15:00,560 --> 0:15:02,560
 I'll count Signal, or CryptPad,

394
0:15:02,560 --> 0:15:04,560
 for example. Um...

395
0:15:04,560 --> 0:15:06,560
 So...

396
0:15:06,560 --> 0:15:08,560
 These...

397
0:15:08,560 --> 0:15:10,560
 Like, if you use Signal or

398
0:15:10,560 --> 0:15:12,560
 CryptPad or email with GPG,

399
0:15:12,560 --> 0:15:14,560
 I guess

400
0:15:14,560 --> 0:15:16,560
 the encryption would have to be broken in order for this to

401
0:15:16,560 --> 0:15:18,560
 comply. So suppose,

402
0:15:18,560 --> 0:15:20,560
 like, you're using

403
0:15:20,560 --> 0:15:22,560
 something like this to communicate

404
0:15:22,560 --> 0:15:24,560
 with your spouse, and one day

405
0:15:24,560 --> 0:15:26,560
 you share a picture of your dog, and that's marked

406
0:15:26,560 --> 0:15:28,560
 as a known... that matches...

407
0:15:28,560 --> 0:15:30,560
 That's a false positive match with an image,

408
0:15:30,560 --> 0:15:32,560
 and there's a...

409
0:15:32,560 --> 0:15:34,560
 I found a paper that they, like,

410
0:15:34,560 --> 0:15:36,560
 they were able to contrive a...

411
0:15:36,560 --> 0:15:38,560
 There were some, like, examples they found that were

412
0:15:38,560 --> 0:15:40,560
 like, in the wild,

413
0:15:40,560 --> 0:15:42,560
 collisions that didn't look anything

414
0:15:42,560 --> 0:15:44,560
 like each other, but then they also were able to find one that

415
0:15:44,560 --> 0:15:46,560
 like, a child looked

416
0:15:46,560 --> 0:15:48,560
 like... a child looked like a dog.

417
0:15:48,560 --> 0:15:50,560
 So, it's totally

418
0:15:50,560 --> 0:15:52,560
 conceivable that a picture of a

419
0:15:52,560 --> 0:15:54,560
 dog could match some known child's

420
0:15:54,560 --> 0:15:56,560
 sexual abuse material.

421
0:15:56,560 --> 0:15:58,560
 And...

422
0:15:58,560 --> 0:16:00,560
 So, if you

423
0:16:00,560 --> 0:16:02,560
 share that, and then also

424
0:16:02,560 --> 0:16:04,560
 maybe you say something

425
0:16:04,560 --> 0:16:06,560
 about meeting somewhere,

426
0:16:06,560 --> 0:16:08,560
 and maybe all

427
0:16:08,560 --> 0:16:10,560
 together this is gonna be a false positive

428
0:16:10,560 --> 0:16:12,560
 for child sexual abuse

429
0:16:12,560 --> 0:16:14,560
 material and grooming, then

430
0:16:14,560 --> 0:16:16,560
 probably a lot of your correspondence

431
0:16:16,560 --> 0:16:18,560
 gets shared, and if you had

432
0:16:18,560 --> 0:16:20,560
 like, passwords in your correspondence,

433
0:16:20,560 --> 0:16:22,560
 that's bad. If you mention

434
0:16:22,560 --> 0:16:24,560
 something that's... like the normal things.

435
0:16:24,560 --> 0:16:26,560
 If you mention something that's legal

436
0:16:26,560 --> 0:16:28,560
 where you are, but not somewhere else,

437
0:16:28,560 --> 0:16:30,560
 or it's

438
0:16:30,560 --> 0:16:32,560
 illegal in the future or something,

439
0:16:32,560 --> 0:16:34,560
 so everyone has something to hide, so

440
0:16:34,560 --> 0:16:36,560
 you are, uh,

441
0:16:36,560 --> 0:16:38,560
 now your privacy is gone

442
0:16:38,560 --> 0:16:40,560
 and you didn't do anything wrong. Meanwhile,

443
0:16:40,560 --> 0:16:42,560
 the people who are abusing the children

444
0:16:42,560 --> 0:16:44,560
 know to use illegal stuff that

445
0:16:44,560 --> 0:16:46,560
 doesn't have this surveillance implemented.

446
0:16:48,560 --> 0:16:50,560
 And then, so that was the

447
0:16:50,560 --> 0:16:52,560
 sad feeling example of why this

448
0:16:52,560 --> 0:16:54,560
 is bad, and now the last thing

449
0:16:54,560 --> 0:16:56,560
 is bad is what some authorities say,

450
0:16:56,560 --> 0:16:58,560
 and I think usually

451
0:16:58,560 --> 0:17:00,560
 hackers aren't so into this, but I hope

452
0:17:00,560 --> 0:17:02,560
 these are okay. There was a similar

453
0:17:02,560 --> 0:17:04,560
 uh, there, so these

454
0:17:04,560 --> 0:17:06,560
 examples are not directly

455
0:17:06,560 --> 0:17:08,560
 on the proposal, but

456
0:17:08,560 --> 0:17:10,560
 they're related enough, I think. There was

457
0:17:10,560 --> 0:17:12,560
 an issue where German police

458
0:17:12,560 --> 0:17:14,560
 was doing some general

459
0:17:14,560 --> 0:17:16,560
 scanning for terrorists,

460
0:17:16,560 --> 0:17:18,560
 and this

461
0:17:18,560 --> 0:17:20,560
 went to court in Germany, and it

462
0:17:20,560 --> 0:17:22,560
 was determined that data screening is legal

463
0:17:22,560 --> 0:17:24,560
 only in the presence of concrete danger.

464
0:17:24,560 --> 0:17:26,560
 So a general threat of terrorism

465
0:17:26,560 --> 0:17:28,560
 does not suffice, and that was determined to be

466
0:17:28,560 --> 0:17:30,560
 bad.

467
0:17:30,560 --> 0:17:32,560
 There was also

468
0:17:32,560 --> 0:17:34,560
 from the 2020 proposal that

469
0:17:34,560 --> 0:17:36,560
 was similar to the 2022 proposal to

470
0:17:36,560 --> 0:17:38,560
 to surveil everyone

471
0:17:38,560 --> 0:17:40,560
 in order to stop child

472
0:17:40,560 --> 0:17:42,560
 sexual abuse. Um,

473
0:17:42,560 --> 0:17:44,560
 the European Data Protection

474
0:17:44,560 --> 0:17:46,560
 Supervisor had some report on this,

475
0:17:46,560 --> 0:17:48,560
 and it said a lot of great

476
0:17:48,560 --> 0:17:50,560
 things, and one of the things it said is that

477
0:17:50,560 --> 0:17:52,560
 confidentiality of communications is a cornerstone

478
0:17:52,560 --> 0:17:54,560
 of the fundamental rights to respect for private

479
0:17:54,560 --> 0:17:56,560
 and family life. Even voluntary

480
0:17:56,560 --> 0:17:58,560
 measures by private companies, and the

481
0:17:58,560 --> 0:18:00,560
 proposal is a requirement,

482
0:18:00,560 --> 0:18:02,560
 not a voluntary measure, but even voluntary measures

483
0:18:02,560 --> 0:18:04,560
 would constitute an interference with these rights

484
0:18:04,560 --> 0:18:06,560
 when the measures involve monitoring and analysis

485
0:18:06,560 --> 0:18:08,560
 of the content of communications

486
0:18:08,560 --> 0:18:10,560
 and processing of personal data.

487
0:18:10,560 --> 0:18:12,560
 And then the last

488
0:18:12,560 --> 0:18:14,560
 big authority is the UN

489
0:18:14,560 --> 0:18:16,560
 Human Rights Council, which did not have, I didn't

490
0:18:16,560 --> 0:18:18,560
 find some report specifically on this,

491
0:18:18,560 --> 0:18:20,560
 but they had some report on

492
0:18:20,560 --> 0:18:22,560
 freedom on maybe the internet or something,

493
0:18:22,560 --> 0:18:24,560
 and, uh,

494
0:18:24,560 --> 0:18:26,560
 I think, like, the German

495
0:18:26,560 --> 0:18:28,560
 Constitutional Court is, like, kind of a

496
0:18:28,560 --> 0:18:30,560
 maybe

497
0:18:30,560 --> 0:18:32,560
 a

498
0:18:32,560 --> 0:18:34,560
 normal, normal, kind of mainstream

499
0:18:34,560 --> 0:18:36,560
 opinion that, like, we shouldn't,

500
0:18:36,560 --> 0:18:38,560
 we can't, it's illegal to scan for terrorists,

501
0:18:38,560 --> 0:18:40,560
 um, just

502
0:18:40,560 --> 0:18:42,560
 general scanning. The, um,

503
0:18:42,560 --> 0:18:44,560
 European Data Super,

504
0:18:44,560 --> 0:18:46,560
 Protection Supervisor I got, who is a little bit closer

505
0:18:46,560 --> 0:18:48,560
 to the hacker one, but the UN Human Rights

506
0:18:48,560 --> 0:18:50,560
 Council report, I think, is

507
0:18:50,560 --> 0:18:52,560
 like, crazy hacker

508
0:18:52,560 --> 0:18:54,560
 level. Because they say that encryption

509
0:18:54,560 --> 0:18:56,560
 and anonymity play a critical role in securing

510
0:18:56,560 --> 0:18:58,560
 the rights of freedom and expression,

511
0:18:58,560 --> 0:19:00,560
 and they specifically mention TOR,

512
0:19:00,560 --> 0:19:02,560
 that TOR should be protected

513
0:19:02,560 --> 0:19:04,560
 and promoted. Like,

514
0:19:04,560 --> 0:19:06,560
 instead of saying we need to,

515
0:19:06,560 --> 0:19:08,560
 um,

516
0:19:08,560 --> 0:19:10,560
 scan all the children's

517
0:19:10,560 --> 0:19:12,560
 communications to protect them from

518
0:19:12,560 --> 0:19:14,560
 sexual abuse, we say

519
0:19:14,560 --> 0:19:16,560
 we need to give children TOR.

520
0:19:16,560 --> 0:19:18,560
 So,

521
0:19:18,560 --> 0:19:20,560
 I think the Human Rights Council

522
0:19:20,560 --> 0:19:22,560
 would also say this is a bad

523
0:19:22,560 --> 0:19:24,560
 regulation.

524
0:19:24,560 --> 0:19:26,560
 And this, of course, begs the question,

525
0:19:26,560 --> 0:19:28,560
 why would people propose

526
0:19:28,560 --> 0:19:30,560
 something so bad?

527
0:19:30,560 --> 0:19:32,560
 And I have two, um,

528
0:19:32,560 --> 0:19:34,560
 ideas.

529
0:19:36,560 --> 0:19:38,560
 One is that people don't realize

530
0:19:38,560 --> 0:19:40,560
 it's impossible to do what they want.

531
0:19:40,560 --> 0:19:42,560
 Because all these proposals say that

532
0:19:42,560 --> 0:19:44,560
 we are going to protect the children and

533
0:19:44,560 --> 0:19:46,560
 at the same time we need to preserve everyone's privacy.

534
0:19:46,560 --> 0:19:48,560
 Including the privacy of the children.

535
0:19:50,560 --> 0:19:52,560
 I found one report by

536
0:19:52,560 --> 0:19:54,560
 one civil society group that

537
0:19:54,560 --> 0:19:56,560
 I thought demonstrated

538
0:19:56,560 --> 0:19:58,560
 this, uh,

539
0:19:58,560 --> 0:20:00,560
 if there's a lack of understanding,

540
0:20:00,560 --> 0:20:02,560
 it demonstrated it well.

541
0:20:02,560 --> 0:20:04,560
 I, um,

542
0:20:04,560 --> 0:20:06,560
 I don't want to

543
0:20:06,560 --> 0:20:08,560
 call out this particular group because I imagine

544
0:20:08,560 --> 0:20:10,560
 it's just the report that I happened to find.

545
0:20:10,560 --> 0:20:12,560
 I suspect there are others that have the same, um,

546
0:20:12,560 --> 0:20:14,560
 view, but I did

547
0:20:14,560 --> 0:20:16,560
 reference the report.

548
0:20:16,560 --> 0:20:18,560
 So it's some group that does

549
0:20:18,560 --> 0:20:20,560
 some, um, it's called Five Rights.

550
0:20:20,560 --> 0:20:22,560
 I guess I'll call it out, but I said it.

551
0:20:22,560 --> 0:20:24,560
 It's probably not just

552
0:20:24,560 --> 0:20:26,560
 about them, uh, that do something

553
0:20:26,560 --> 0:20:28,560
 related to protecting children. And they had this

554
0:20:28,560 --> 0:20:30,560
 very long report about very wonderful

555
0:20:30,560 --> 0:20:32,560
 things about all the rights that children have

556
0:20:32,560 --> 0:20:34,560
 and I think all humans should have these rights,

557
0:20:34,560 --> 0:20:36,560
 not just children, but all these wonderful

558
0:20:36,560 --> 0:20:38,560
 rights that, uh, they need.

559
0:20:38,560 --> 0:20:40,560
 And then there was just one paragraph in this

560
0:20:40,560 --> 0:20:42,560
 very long report

561
0:20:42,560 --> 0:20:44,560
 saying that, um,

562
0:20:44,560 --> 0:20:46,560
 the children need privacy, but the privacy should not

563
0:20:46,560 --> 0:20:48,560
 protect the child sex abusers

564
0:20:48,560 --> 0:20:50,560
 nor interfere

565
0:20:50,560 --> 0:20:52,560
 with child sexual abuse detection systems.

566
0:20:52,560 --> 0:20:54,560
 But that's all they said on it.

567
0:20:54,560 --> 0:20:56,560
 Like, one or two sentences.

568
0:20:56,560 --> 0:20:58,560
 So they didn't say how you're supposed to

569
0:21:00,560 --> 0:21:02,560
 protect the privacy, but

570
0:21:02,560 --> 0:21:04,560
 not interfere with the child sexual abuse detection

571
0:21:04,560 --> 0:21:06,560
 systems.

572
0:21:06,560 --> 0:21:08,560
 And

573
0:21:08,560 --> 0:21:10,560
 like, maybe they

574
0:21:10,560 --> 0:21:12,560
 maybe they were hiding that they didn't know

575
0:21:12,560 --> 0:21:14,560
 or maybe they truly didn't know, but

576
0:21:14,560 --> 0:21:16,560
 the point here is one theory is that people actually

577
0:21:16,560 --> 0:21:18,560
 think it's possible to

578
0:21:18,560 --> 0:21:20,560
 um, scan

579
0:21:20,560 --> 0:21:22,560
 all the messages for child sexual abuse while

580
0:21:22,560 --> 0:21:24,560
 not destroying

581
0:21:24,560 --> 0:21:26,560
 freedom.

582
0:21:26,560 --> 0:21:28,560
 But, uh, the other

583
0:21:28,560 --> 0:21:30,560
 theory is maybe more fun. It's a conspiracy

584
0:21:30,560 --> 0:21:32,560
 theory. There is this group called

585
0:21:32,560 --> 0:21:34,560
 THORN that is, like, started by

586
0:21:34,560 --> 0:21:36,560
 this famous guy, Ashton Kutcher, who

587
0:21:36,560 --> 0:21:38,560
 uh, it's, they're like

588
0:21:38,560 --> 0:21:40,560
 stop child sexual abuse

589
0:21:40,560 --> 0:21:42,560
 on the internet thing.

590
0:21:42,560 --> 0:21:44,560
 And, so

591
0:21:44,560 --> 0:21:46,560
 Ashton Kutcher

592
0:21:46,560 --> 0:21:48,560
 and other people from THORN have been

593
0:21:48,560 --> 0:21:50,560
 lobbying the EU to

594
0:21:50,560 --> 0:21:52,560
 have proposals like this.

595
0:21:52,560 --> 0:21:54,560
 ...

596
0:21:54,560 --> 0:21:56,560
 Um, so

597
0:21:56,560 --> 0:21:58,560
 you could say, like,

598
0:21:58,560 --> 0:22:00,560
 they're just another people who

599
0:22:00,560 --> 0:22:02,560
 don't know better, like, they think it's possible.

600
0:22:02,560 --> 0:22:04,560
 Um, but actually they also have a

601
0:22:04,560 --> 0:22:06,560
 proprietary screening service that

602
0:22:06,560 --> 0:22:08,560
 I, it seems to me like they sell it, actually.

603
0:22:08,560 --> 0:22:10,560
 Even though they're, THORN is a foundation.

604
0:22:10,560 --> 0:22:12,560
 They have this proprietary scanning service

605
0:22:12,560 --> 0:22:14,560
 called SAFER

606
0:22:14,560 --> 0:22:16,560
 that I think they sell.

607
0:22:16,560 --> 0:22:18,560
 Um,

608
0:22:18,560 --> 0:22:20,560
 and

609
0:22:20,560 --> 0:22:22,560
 it could be that

610
0:22:22,560 --> 0:22:24,560
 SAFER requires the client side

611
0:22:24,560 --> 0:22:26,560
 it requires

612
0:22:26,560 --> 0:22:28,560
 I mean, they already have customers

613
0:22:28,560 --> 0:22:30,560
 maybe if it were required that we

614
0:22:30,560 --> 0:22:32,560
 surveil everyone, they would have more

615
0:22:32,560 --> 0:22:34,560
 customers.

616
0:22:34,560 --> 0:22:36,560
 Um, so they've been lobbying

617
0:22:36,560 --> 0:22:38,560
 the EU government

618
0:22:38,560 --> 0:22:40,560
 and the person

619
0:22:40,560 --> 0:22:42,560
 um

620
0:22:42,560 --> 0:22:44,560
 someone who's been involved in this

621
0:22:44,560 --> 0:22:46,560
 uh, I don't really

622
0:22:46,560 --> 0:22:48,560
 know anything about government, so I don't

623
0:22:48,560 --> 0:22:50,560
 I'm not gonna say, like, a big word

624
0:22:50,560 --> 0:22:52,560
 like a proposed, cause I don't actually know

625
0:22:52,560 --> 0:22:54,560
 what that means, but um

626
0:22:54,560 --> 0:22:56,560
 uh, Ursula von der Leyen

627
0:22:56,560 --> 0:22:58,560
 has been involved in

628
0:22:58,560 --> 0:23:00,560
 quite involved in this particular

629
0:23:00,560 --> 0:23:02,560
 um, proposal

630
0:23:02,560 --> 0:23:04,560
 so it could be, like

631
0:23:04,560 --> 0:23:06,560
 they talked to her because

632
0:23:06,560 --> 0:23:08,560
 the lobbyist talked to her because she's actually

633
0:23:08,560 --> 0:23:10,560
 proposed similarly

634
0:23:10,560 --> 0:23:12,560
 similar style of thing, like surveil people

635
0:23:12,560 --> 0:23:14,560
 to protect the children before

636
0:23:14,560 --> 0:23:16,560
 which gave her the nickname

637
0:23:16,560 --> 0:23:18,560
 Sensusula in Germany

638
0:23:18,560 --> 0:23:20,560
 apparently

639
0:23:20,560 --> 0:23:22,560
 when, like, ten years ago

640
0:23:22,560 --> 0:23:24,560
 so, uh

641
0:23:24,560 --> 0:23:26,560
 yes, so we got to the

642
0:23:26,560 --> 0:23:28,560
 like

643
0:23:28,560 --> 0:23:30,560
 that was why

644
0:23:30,560 --> 0:23:32,560
 uh, it's bad and why people might

645
0:23:32,560 --> 0:23:34,560
 want to do it anyway

646
0:23:34,560 --> 0:23:36,560
 now the last point

647
0:23:36,560 --> 0:23:38,560
 maybe there's something we can do about it

648
0:23:38,560 --> 0:23:40,560
 there's already, like, a bunch of groups

649
0:23:40,560 --> 0:23:42,560
 writing about how bad it is

650
0:23:42,560 --> 0:23:44,560
 which made it easy for me to tell you how bad it is

651
0:23:44,560 --> 0:23:46,560
 um, and

652
0:23:46,560 --> 0:23:48,560
 I linked to some of those in these notes

653
0:23:48,560 --> 0:23:50,560
 that you will be able to find in the program

654
0:23:50,560 --> 0:23:52,560
 but also

655
0:23:52,560 --> 0:23:54,560
 this was proposed in May

656
0:23:54,560 --> 0:23:56,560
 so, there hasn't been a big

657
0:23:56,560 --> 0:23:58,560
 European election since

658
0:23:58,560 --> 0:24:00,560
 it's been proposed, and it's possible

659
0:24:00,560 --> 0:24:02,560
 that this, like, whenever

660
0:24:02,560 --> 0:24:04,560
 the Danish election comes up

661
0:24:04,560 --> 0:24:06,560
 it will be the first big election that

662
0:24:06,560 --> 0:24:08,560
 since this has been proposed, so it might be

663
0:24:08,560 --> 0:24:10,560
 something we should keep in mind

664
0:24:10,560 --> 0:24:12,560
 and, like

665
0:24:12,560 --> 0:24:14,560
 yeah

666
0:24:14,560 --> 0:24:16,560
 so, that's all

667
0:24:16,560 --> 0:24:18,560
 thank you

668
0:24:24,560 --> 0:24:26,560
 any questions?

669
0:24:32,560 --> 0:24:34,560
 hello, I'm Henrik

670
0:24:34,560 --> 0:24:36,560
 there's at least two problems with these

671
0:24:36,560 --> 0:24:38,560
 things in general

672
0:24:38,560 --> 0:24:40,560
 one is about the very emotional

673
0:24:40,560 --> 0:24:42,560
 that we talk about child sex abuse

674
0:24:42,560 --> 0:24:44,560
 and everybody wants to protect against that

675
0:24:44,560 --> 0:24:46,560
 but they spend a lot of time

676
0:24:46,560 --> 0:24:48,560
 arguing about that

677
0:24:48,560 --> 0:24:50,560
 before they get to the second part

678
0:24:50,560 --> 0:24:52,560
 where they say we must protect the children

679
0:24:52,560 --> 0:24:54,560
 is something that you really can't do

680
0:24:54,560 --> 0:24:56,560
 these systems that detect it reliably

681
0:24:56,560 --> 0:24:58,560
 and we've seen it with

682
0:24:58,560 --> 0:25:00,560
 anti-virus systems, and we also have the same

683
0:25:00,560 --> 0:25:02,560
 similar parallels with terrorism

684
0:25:02,560 --> 0:25:04,560
 where you cannot detect terrorism

685
0:25:04,560 --> 0:25:06,560
 because we have like 200 definitions of what

686
0:25:06,560 --> 0:25:08,560
 terror is

687
0:25:08,560 --> 0:25:10,560
 so, they skip the part of

688
0:25:10,560 --> 0:25:12,560
 what is possible, and then they use a lot of time

689
0:25:12,560 --> 0:25:14,560
 on the emotional part, and I'm not sure how we could

690
0:25:14,560 --> 0:25:16,560
 combat that, or how we can argue against that

691
0:25:16,560 --> 0:25:18,560
 I typically try to shut down

692
0:25:18,560 --> 0:25:20,560
 the first part, saying that we all

693
0:25:20,560 --> 0:25:22,560
 want that, so you don't have to talk about it

694
0:25:22,560 --> 0:25:24,560
 but any ideas about

695
0:25:24,560 --> 0:25:26,560
 how we can fight it would be nice

696
0:25:28,560 --> 0:25:30,560
 Well, I've given you my ideas so far

697
0:25:30,560 --> 0:25:32,560
 one is to say it doesn't work

698
0:25:32,560 --> 0:25:34,560
 and the other is to

699
0:25:34,560 --> 0:25:36,560
 oh, I said it doesn't work

700
0:25:36,560 --> 0:25:38,560
 I did all three

701
0:25:38,560 --> 0:25:40,560
 I gave the emotional argument

702
0:25:40,560 --> 0:25:42,560
 and I gave the authorities what they're saying

703
0:25:42,560 --> 0:25:44,560
 another point is

704
0:25:44,560 --> 0:25:46,560
 this is one of the reasons I like the conspiracy theory

705
0:25:46,560 --> 0:25:48,560
 because I think it makes more sense

706
0:25:48,560 --> 0:25:50,560
 than

707
0:25:50,560 --> 0:25:52,560
 people really don't know

708
0:25:52,560 --> 0:25:54,560
 I mean, it could be combined

709
0:25:54,560 --> 0:25:56,560
 you hire people who

710
0:25:56,560 --> 0:25:58,560
 don't know better to lobby

711
0:25:58,560 --> 0:26:00,560
 maybe that helps

712
0:26:00,560 --> 0:26:02,560
 but anyone else have ideas?

713
0:26:06,560 --> 0:26:08,560
 Not an idea, but another question

714
0:26:08,560 --> 0:26:10,560
 Which legislation is

715
0:26:10,560 --> 0:26:12,560
 superior if I have an iPhone?

716
0:26:12,560 --> 0:26:14,560
 Is it the American

717
0:26:14,560 --> 0:26:16,560
 legislation that needs to scan

718
0:26:16,560 --> 0:26:18,560
 my phone, or is it the European that has to

719
0:26:18,560 --> 0:26:20,560
 scan my phone, or is it the Australian that I

720
0:26:20,560 --> 0:26:22,560
 communicate with?

721
0:26:22,560 --> 0:26:24,560
 I don't know

722
0:26:24,560 --> 0:26:26,560
 No, that's also a problem

723
0:26:26,560 --> 0:26:28,560
 Wait, which is

724
0:26:28,560 --> 0:26:30,560
 do you say which is better or which applies?

725
0:26:30,560 --> 0:26:32,560
 Which applies, which is superior

726
0:26:32,560 --> 0:26:34,560
 Oh, I see

727
0:26:34,560 --> 0:26:36,560
 Or should they all?

728
0:26:36,560 --> 0:26:38,560
 Probably they all

729
0:26:38,560 --> 0:26:40,560
 I mean, it's also not defined

730
0:26:40,560 --> 0:26:42,560
 the internet is, yeah

731
0:26:44,560 --> 0:26:46,560
 Any more questions?

732
0:26:48,560 --> 0:26:50,560
 But yeah, that's a good point, that's the problem

733
0:26:50,560 --> 0:26:52,560
 Oh wait, actually no, I do have some

734
0:26:52,560 --> 0:26:54,560
 I can say something vaguely related to that

735
0:26:54,560 --> 0:26:56,560
 So this article

736
0:26:56,560 --> 0:26:58,560
 that I read about, like it was some journalist

737
0:26:58,560 --> 0:27:00,560
 who was trying to

738
0:27:00,560 --> 0:27:02,560
 who was questioning this idea that the police can't

739
0:27:02,560 --> 0:27:04,560
 take down stuff

740
0:27:04,560 --> 0:27:06,560
 He was saying

741
0:27:06,560 --> 0:27:08,560
 the police say there's like

742
0:27:08,560 --> 0:27:10,560
 the abuse material

743
0:27:10,560 --> 0:27:12,560
 is in offshore servers

744
0:27:12,560 --> 0:27:14,560
 so we can't do anything about it

745
0:27:14,560 --> 0:27:16,560
 Well, first thing is, if you just email them, they'll take it down

746
0:27:16,560 --> 0:27:18,560
 regardless of where it is, but usually

747
0:27:18,560 --> 0:27:20,560
 it's like

748
0:27:20,560 --> 0:27:22,560
 in some place with good internet, like Europe

749
0:27:22,560 --> 0:27:24,560
 you know, so

750
0:27:26,560 --> 0:27:28,560
 it might not even matter

751
0:27:28,560 --> 0:27:30,560
 which one's superior, like

752
0:27:30,560 --> 0:27:32,560
 it might all just already be covered

753
0:27:34,560 --> 0:27:36,560
 Hi, I'm Karen

754
0:27:36,560 --> 0:27:38,560
 Thanks very much for the presentation

755
0:27:38,560 --> 0:27:40,560
 There has been

756
0:27:40,560 --> 0:27:42,560
 some debate about the proposal from the commission

757
0:27:42,560 --> 0:27:44,560
 already, but mainly from

758
0:27:44,560 --> 0:27:46,560
 I'm in the European Parliament

759
0:27:46,560 --> 0:27:48,560
 and mainly from colleagues from Germany

760
0:27:48,560 --> 0:27:50,560
 that have been aware of this chat control

761
0:27:50,560 --> 0:27:52,560
 proposal

762
0:27:52,560 --> 0:27:54,560
 How will we be able to

763
0:27:54,560 --> 0:27:56,560
 unify sort of

764
0:27:56,560 --> 0:27:58,560
 the populations

765
0:27:58,560 --> 0:28:00,560
 and the opinions in other countries

766
0:28:00,560 --> 0:28:02,560
 because I can do some stuff in the European Parliament

767
0:28:02,560 --> 0:28:04,560
 as a Danish MEP, but

768
0:28:04,560 --> 0:28:06,560
 unless we put pressure on the Danish

769
0:28:06,560 --> 0:28:08,560
 government to stop it at the European

770
0:28:08,560 --> 0:28:10,560
 Council and in other

771
0:28:10,560 --> 0:28:12,560
 European countries do the same

772
0:28:12,560 --> 0:28:14,560
 then how, is there

773
0:28:14,560 --> 0:28:16,560
 a debate about this in

774
0:28:16,560 --> 0:28:18,560
 other countries than Germany

775
0:28:18,560 --> 0:28:20,560
 and for the audience, how do we actually

776
0:28:20,560 --> 0:28:22,560
 make this a debate that's going to

777
0:28:22,560 --> 0:28:24,560
 be going on in Denmark

778
0:28:24,560 --> 0:28:26,560
 and some suggestions for that

779
0:28:26,560 --> 0:28:28,560
 and then also you were mentioning the lobbying

780
0:28:28,560 --> 0:28:30,560
 towards the EU institutions

781
0:28:30,560 --> 0:28:32,560
 has there been any proof of

782
0:28:32,560 --> 0:28:34,560
 that, has there been any questions asked

783
0:28:34,560 --> 0:28:36,560
 because otherwise that is something that we

784
0:28:36,560 --> 0:28:38,560
 perhaps should look at, asking questions on

785
0:28:38,560 --> 0:28:40,560
 Yes, so to the

786
0:28:40,560 --> 0:28:42,560
 first point, how to unify

787
0:28:42,560 --> 0:28:44,560
 people, I don't know

788
0:28:44,560 --> 0:28:46,560
 maybe you can tell me, if I knew better

789
0:28:46,560 --> 0:28:48,560
 maybe I would go into politics

790
0:28:50,560 --> 0:28:52,560
 To the second point, yes

791
0:28:52,560 --> 0:28:54,560
 a bunch of people have made freedom of

792
0:28:54,560 --> 0:28:56,560
 information requests to competent

793
0:28:56,560 --> 0:28:58,560
 authorities to get these

794
0:28:58,560 --> 0:29:00,560
 meetings with Thorn

795
0:29:00,560 --> 0:29:02,560
 and I

796
0:29:02,560 --> 0:29:04,560
 in the link

797
0:29:04,560 --> 0:29:06,560
 that you will see in the

798
0:29:06,560 --> 0:29:08,560
 program, you can see all these

799
0:29:10,560 --> 0:29:12,560
 actually I can even open them right now

800
0:29:22,560 --> 0:29:28,560
 Okay

801
0:29:28,560 --> 0:29:30,560
 So

802
0:29:30,560 --> 0:29:32,560
 Yes

803
0:29:32,560 --> 0:29:34,560
 so like, there are so many

804
0:29:34,560 --> 0:29:36,560
 but here we go

805
0:29:36,560 --> 0:29:38,560
 like someone requested

806
0:29:38,560 --> 0:29:40,560
 a list

807
0:29:40,560 --> 0:29:42,560
 of all the meetings with Thorn

808
0:29:42,560 --> 0:29:44,560
 from a Swedish government

809
0:29:44,560 --> 0:29:46,560
 and this has

810
0:29:46,560 --> 0:29:48,560
 like, here are all the meetings

811
0:29:50,560 --> 0:29:52,560
 there are a bunch

812
0:29:52,560 --> 0:29:54,560
 So I guess

813
0:29:54,560 --> 0:29:56,560
 actually the list of meetings itself

814
0:29:56,560 --> 0:29:58,560
 isn't all that interesting but the person who

815
0:29:58,560 --> 0:30:00,560
 requested maybe is quite interesting

816
0:30:02,560 --> 0:30:04,560
 Does that help?

817
0:30:04,560 --> 0:30:06,560
 Okay

818
0:30:14,560 --> 0:30:16,560
 Then we go on to the next question

819
0:30:18,560 --> 0:30:20,560
 Yeah, maybe it's also a comment

820
0:30:20,560 --> 0:30:22,560
 I think the last success we had was

821
0:30:22,560 --> 0:30:24,560
 11 years ago with

822
0:30:24,560 --> 0:30:26,560
 Akta and here it

823
0:30:26,560 --> 0:30:28,560
 actually managed to go into the

824
0:30:28,560 --> 0:30:30,560
 public media and we went to the

825
0:30:30,560 --> 0:30:32,560
 streets and we did everything

826
0:30:32,560 --> 0:30:34,560
 I just don't know why it happened

827
0:30:34,560 --> 0:30:36,560
 but at some point we

828
0:30:36,560 --> 0:30:38,560
 made it to a critical mass

829
0:30:38,560 --> 0:30:40,560
 and then it was actually

830
0:30:40,560 --> 0:30:42,560
 easier at least so

831
0:30:42,560 --> 0:30:44,560
 we mass mailed politicians and we

832
0:30:44,560 --> 0:30:46,560
 did a lot of things so

833
0:30:46,560 --> 0:30:48,560
 I think that could

834
0:30:48,560 --> 0:30:50,560
 at least teach us a little bit about

835
0:30:50,560 --> 0:30:52,560
 what is possible instead of

836
0:30:52,560 --> 0:30:54,560
 us saying, okay, nothing is possible

837
0:30:56,560 --> 0:30:58,560
 Do you agree?

838
0:30:58,560 --> 0:31:00,560
 I don't really understand

839
0:31:00,560 --> 0:31:02,560
 how normal people work. I mean

840
0:31:02,560 --> 0:31:04,560
 sometimes in very special contexts

841
0:31:04,560 --> 0:31:06,560
 with many years of study I can learn

842
0:31:06,560 --> 0:31:08,560
 I do happen to have

843
0:31:08,560 --> 0:31:10,560
 like a

844
0:31:10,560 --> 0:31:12,560
 like a

845
0:31:12,560 --> 0:31:14,560
 qualified source

846
0:31:14,560 --> 0:31:16,560
 had a theory on the Akta thing

847
0:31:18,560 --> 0:31:20,560
 maybe I'll tell you later but her theory

848
0:31:20,560 --> 0:31:22,560
 was that

849
0:31:22,560 --> 0:31:24,560
 it was because of Polish

850
0:31:24,560 --> 0:31:26,560
 soccer fans who couldn't watch their

851
0:31:26,560 --> 0:31:28,560
 soccer

852
0:31:28,560 --> 0:31:30,560
 I think

853
0:31:30,560 --> 0:31:32,560
 that's

854
0:31:32,560 --> 0:31:34,560
 why it

855
0:31:34,560 --> 0:31:36,560
 I might be remembering it correctly

856
0:31:36,560 --> 0:31:38,560
 whether it was Akta or something else

857
0:31:38,560 --> 0:31:40,560
 but I definitely remember

858
0:31:40,560 --> 0:31:42,560
 there was Polish soccer fans

859
0:31:42,560 --> 0:31:44,560
 that couldn't watch their soccer

860
0:31:48,560 --> 0:31:50,560
 Any more questions?

861
0:31:50,560 --> 0:31:52,560
 Here?

862
0:31:52,560 --> 0:31:58,560
 You mentioned

863
0:31:58,560 --> 0:32:00,560
 that already but

864
0:32:00,560 --> 0:32:02,560
 there is definitely

865
0:32:02,560 --> 0:32:04,560
 also an unwillingness

866
0:32:04,560 --> 0:32:06,560
 of the police to do

867
0:32:06,560 --> 0:32:08,560
 what is necessary to

868
0:32:08,560 --> 0:32:10,560
 get these materials

869
0:32:10,560 --> 0:32:12,560
 offline. There has been

870
0:32:12,560 --> 0:32:14,560
 a report on public German television

871
0:32:14,560 --> 0:32:16,560
 where the reporter

872
0:32:16,560 --> 0:32:18,560
 sneaked himself into several

873
0:32:18,560 --> 0:32:20,560
 child porn forums

874
0:32:20,560 --> 0:32:22,560
 where there were sharehoster links

875
0:32:22,560 --> 0:32:24,560
 to such material

876
0:32:24,560 --> 0:32:26,560
 and he just

877
0:32:26,560 --> 0:32:28,560
 reported that

878
0:32:28,560 --> 0:32:30,560
 to the admin

879
0:32:30,560 --> 0:32:32,560
 of the machines where

880
0:32:32,560 --> 0:32:34,560
 the stuff was

881
0:32:34,560 --> 0:32:36,560
 and it disappeared within hours

882
0:32:36,560 --> 0:32:38,560
 or

883
0:32:38,560 --> 0:32:40,560
 in the worst cases days

884
0:32:40,560 --> 0:32:42,560
 and like 80% were hosted in the

885
0:32:42,560 --> 0:32:44,560
 US and Germany

886
0:32:44,560 --> 0:32:46,560
 so it really works

887
0:32:46,560 --> 0:32:48,560
 and that begs the question

888
0:32:48,560 --> 0:32:50,560
 if that was

889
0:32:50,560 --> 0:32:52,560
 really the thing

890
0:32:52,560 --> 0:32:54,560
 it's all about

891
0:32:54,560 --> 0:32:56,560
 why don't they just do it

892
0:32:56,560 --> 0:32:58,560
 because it's proven

893
0:32:58,560 --> 0:33:00,560
 that it works

894
0:33:00,560 --> 0:33:02,560
 so there might be other

895
0:33:02,560 --> 0:33:04,560
 other ideas

896
0:33:04,560 --> 0:33:06,560
 behind constructing such

897
0:33:06,560 --> 0:33:08,560
 an infrastructure

898
0:33:08,560 --> 0:33:10,560
 to do

899
0:33:10,560 --> 0:33:12,560
 other things than going against

900
0:33:12,560 --> 0:33:14,560
 child porn

901
0:33:14,560 --> 0:33:16,560
 Yes, I suspect that's the exact

902
0:33:16,560 --> 0:33:18,560
 same article that I read

903
0:33:18,560 --> 0:33:20,560
 It's a TV report

904
0:33:20,560 --> 0:33:22,560
 Well

905
0:33:22,560 --> 0:33:24,560
 I messed with something

906
0:33:24,560 --> 0:33:26,560
 um

907
0:33:26,560 --> 0:33:28,560
 the uh

908
0:33:28,560 --> 0:33:30,560
 the person

909
0:33:30,560 --> 0:33:32,560
 uh

910
0:33:32,560 --> 0:33:34,560
 it was either

911
0:33:34,560 --> 0:33:36,560
 no it was

912
0:33:36,560 --> 0:33:38,560
 Robert

913
0:33:38,560 --> 0:33:40,560
 and Daniel

914
0:33:40,560 --> 0:33:42,560
 Mosbuecker

915
0:33:42,560 --> 0:33:44,560
 was what I have

916
0:33:44,560 --> 0:33:46,560
 but you know since

917
0:33:46,560 --> 0:33:48,560
 I just want to point out

918
0:33:48,560 --> 0:33:50,560
 because you bring up the topic

919
0:33:50,560 --> 0:33:52,560
 of reporting

920
0:33:52,560 --> 0:33:54,560
 when you see the child sexual abuse

921
0:33:54,560 --> 0:33:56,560
 material on the website and reporting it

922
0:33:56,560 --> 0:33:58,560
 that is just part of this

923
0:33:58,560 --> 0:34:00,560
 and that's like

924
0:34:00,560 --> 0:34:02,560
 that's kind of like the easy thing

925
0:34:02,560 --> 0:34:04,560
 because if it's

926
0:34:04,560 --> 0:34:06,560
 if it's known to

927
0:34:06,560 --> 0:34:08,560
 if you've already established

928
0:34:08,560 --> 0:34:10,560
 if it's already in the database

929
0:34:10,560 --> 0:34:12,560
 it's pretty easy to do this

930
0:34:12,560 --> 0:34:14,560
 and this regulation would

931
0:34:14,560 --> 0:34:16,560
 the proposal would do much more than that

932
0:34:16,560 --> 0:34:18,560
 I mean maybe it wouldn't actually

933
0:34:18,560 --> 0:34:20,560
 but like the way it's written

934
0:34:20,560 --> 0:34:22,560
 in order to comply you would have to do much more than that

935
0:34:22,560 --> 0:34:24,560
 than

936
0:34:24,560 --> 0:34:26,560
 than just taking down the material

937
0:34:36,560 --> 0:34:38,560
 I think 11 years ago

938
0:34:38,560 --> 0:34:40,560
 with ACTA there was

939
0:34:40,560 --> 0:34:42,560
 the luck that the digital rights

940
0:34:42,560 --> 0:34:44,560
 community and the sort of

941
0:34:44,560 --> 0:34:46,560
 anti-globalization and

942
0:34:46,560 --> 0:34:48,560
 anti-capitalist movements

943
0:34:48,560 --> 0:34:50,560
 came together in a common cause

944
0:34:50,560 --> 0:34:52,560
 and therefore managed to

945
0:34:52,560 --> 0:34:54,560
 stop a trade deal with the US

946
0:34:54,560 --> 0:34:56,560
 and I think that was perhaps why

947
0:34:56,560 --> 0:34:58,560
 it succeeded 11 years ago

948
0:34:58,560 --> 0:35:00,560
 I think

949
0:35:00,560 --> 0:35:02,560
 in order to stop the proposal on

950
0:35:02,560 --> 0:35:04,560
 chat control I think we need to

951
0:35:04,560 --> 0:35:06,560
 emphasize on the fact that it doesn't work

952
0:35:06,560 --> 0:35:08,560
 that it will not make

953
0:35:08,560 --> 0:35:10,560
 lives safer

954
0:35:10,560 --> 0:35:12,560
 for children because if we just say

955
0:35:12,560 --> 0:35:14,560
 it's bad for all of our

956
0:35:14,560 --> 0:35:16,560
 privacy even though that we feel that this is

957
0:35:16,560 --> 0:35:18,560
 an important enough argument

958
0:35:18,560 --> 0:35:20,560
 others will say well if the balance

959
0:35:20,560 --> 0:35:22,560
 is saving children

960
0:35:22,560 --> 0:35:24,560
 on the internet and

961
0:35:24,560 --> 0:35:26,560
 giving up a little bit of our privacy

962
0:35:26,560 --> 0:35:28,560
 then we will prefer saving the children

963
0:35:28,560 --> 0:35:30,560
 on the internet so we'll have to say

964
0:35:30,560 --> 0:35:32,560
 that this is not something that is

965
0:35:32,560 --> 0:35:34,560
 going to work and it

966
0:35:34,560 --> 0:35:36,560
 is going to be cost

967
0:35:36,560 --> 0:35:38,560
 too much where the

968
0:35:38,560 --> 0:35:40,560
 lobbying from the company that wants to perhaps

969
0:35:40,560 --> 0:35:42,560
 sell their

970
0:35:42,560 --> 0:35:44,560
 filtering mechanism

971
0:35:44,560 --> 0:35:46,560
 might come in handy

972
0:35:46,560 --> 0:35:48,560
 and then also saying well I mean we need to use

973
0:35:48,560 --> 0:35:50,560
 police resources in an effective

974
0:35:50,560 --> 0:35:52,560
 manner to actually help

975
0:35:52,560 --> 0:35:54,560
 children that are being

976
0:35:54,560 --> 0:35:56,560
 groomed or abused

977
0:35:56,560 --> 0:35:58,560
 and I think those are sort of the arguments that we

978
0:35:58,560 --> 0:36:00,560
 need to play on because if we just say it's

979
0:36:00,560 --> 0:36:02,560
 bad for our privacy and it's

980
0:36:02,560 --> 0:36:04,560
 not in order

981
0:36:04,560 --> 0:36:06,560
 to save children then I don't think we'll

982
0:36:06,560 --> 0:36:08,560
 mobilize that many people so I think we

983
0:36:08,560 --> 0:36:10,560
 really need to emphasize on what would

984
0:36:10,560 --> 0:36:12,560
 work rather than

985
0:36:12,560 --> 0:36:14,560
 and then we might be able

986
0:36:14,560 --> 0:36:16,560
 to stop this throwing tech at

987
0:36:16,560 --> 0:36:18,560
 a societal problem which

988
0:36:18,560 --> 0:36:20,560
 I think this is they

989
0:36:20,560 --> 0:36:22,560
 had the original proposal from

990
0:36:22,560 --> 0:36:24,560
 2020 that didn't

991
0:36:24,560 --> 0:36:26,560
 come forward and then now trying

992
0:36:26,560 --> 0:36:28,560
 again saying okay we have this problem

993
0:36:28,560 --> 0:36:30,560
 that we don't know how to deal with and therefore

994
0:36:30,560 --> 0:36:32,560
 let's just throw some technology

995
0:36:32,560 --> 0:36:34,560
 at it and see if it sticks

996
0:36:36,560 --> 0:36:38,560
 Thank you

997
0:36:38,560 --> 0:36:40,560
 Actually if I may just also

998
0:36:40,560 --> 0:36:42,560
 bounce off of that point there's another aspect

999
0:36:42,560 --> 0:36:44,560
 to it which I think is really important it's not

1000
0:36:44,560 --> 0:36:46,560
 necessarily that it doesn't help it can actually

1001
0:36:46,560 --> 0:36:48,560
 make the situation much worse

1002
0:36:48,560 --> 0:36:50,560
 because as it currently

1003
0:36:50,560 --> 0:36:52,560
 stands the people

1004
0:36:52,560 --> 0:36:54,560
 who are distributing this material feel comfortable

1005
0:36:54,560 --> 0:36:56,560
 distributing it over WhatsApp catch

1006
0:36:56,560 --> 0:36:58,560
 one of them and you've got the phone numbers of all the others

1007
0:36:58,560 --> 0:37:00,560
 if we pass

1008
0:37:00,560 --> 0:37:02,560
 this law we will push them

1009
0:37:02,560 --> 0:37:04,560
 onto the dark web or other

1010
0:37:04,560 --> 0:37:06,560
 distribution means which

1011
0:37:06,560 --> 0:37:08,560
 are more difficult to trace so

1012
0:37:08,560 --> 0:37:10,560
 as a result basically it will actually make the

1013
0:37:10,560 --> 0:37:12,560
 lives of these people easier

1014
0:37:12,560 --> 0:37:14,560
 and it will make it much harder to catch them

1015
0:37:14,560 --> 0:37:16,560
 so I think that's also something that we should push

1016
0:37:16,560 --> 0:37:18,560
 that not only will it not work it might

1017
0:37:18,560 --> 0:37:20,560
 actually make the situation worse

1018
0:37:20,560 --> 0:37:22,560
 It gives me two

1019
0:37:22,560 --> 0:37:24,560
 actually both of the last two comments

1020
0:37:24,560 --> 0:37:26,560
 give me

1021
0:37:26,560 --> 0:37:28,560
 one of the thoughts is

1022
0:37:28,560 --> 0:37:30,560
 we don't have any

1023
0:37:30,560 --> 0:37:32,560
 evidence to say it will work

1024
0:37:32,560 --> 0:37:34,560
 which is a reason not to do this

1025
0:37:34,560 --> 0:37:36,560
 but unfortunately we don't have any

1026
0:37:36,560 --> 0:37:38,560
 evidence like where someone

1027
0:37:38,560 --> 0:37:40,560
 implemented it and it didn't work so that we

1028
0:37:40,560 --> 0:37:42,560
 can point to

1029
0:37:42,560 --> 0:37:44,560
 it would kind of be nice if we did

1030
0:37:44,560 --> 0:37:46,560
 it would be a very easy argument

1031
0:37:46,560 --> 0:37:48,560
 and then

1032
0:37:48,560 --> 0:37:50,560
 to your theory that

1033
0:37:50,560 --> 0:37:52,560
 they are already comfortable using WhatsApp

1034
0:37:52,560 --> 0:37:54,560
 so they would be pushed onto another

1035
0:37:54,560 --> 0:37:56,560
 service

1036
0:37:56,560 --> 0:37:58,560
 there is a competing theory

1037
0:37:58,560 --> 0:38:00,560
 that because you can

1038
0:38:00,560 --> 0:38:02,560
 share it on

1039
0:38:02,560 --> 0:38:04,560
 like normal

1040
0:38:06,560 --> 0:38:08,560
 protocols

1041
0:38:08,560 --> 0:38:10,560
 then it becomes normalized to

1042
0:38:10,560 --> 0:38:12,560
 distribute child sexual abuse material

1043
0:38:12,560 --> 0:38:14,560
 and so more people will do it

1044
0:38:14,560 --> 0:38:16,560
 so I think that argument itself

1045
0:38:16,560 --> 0:38:18,560
 like

1046
0:38:18,560 --> 0:38:20,560
 with an experiment

1047
0:38:20,560 --> 0:38:22,560
 or something that would work

1048
0:38:22,560 --> 0:38:24,560
 but on its own I don't think it works

1049
0:38:26,560 --> 0:38:28,560
 Any more questions?

1050
0:38:28,560 --> 0:38:30,560
 No?

1051
0:38:30,560 --> 0:38:32,560
 Thank you very much

1052
0:38:32,560 --> 0:38:34,560
 for a very interesting talk

1053
0:38:34,560 --> 0:38:36,560
 Thank you
