0:00:00,000 --> 0:00:18,920
 Good morning everybody, or good afternoon.

2
0:00:18,920 --> 0:00:24,080
 So we are going to go through some stats for a token game and a little bit about what we

3
0:00:24,080 --> 0:00:28,800
 did this year with HackerJBD and other game related stuff.

4
0:00:28,800 --> 0:00:34,560
 So HackerJBD this year had 52 categories sent to the mailing list, but unfortunately only

5
0:00:34,560 --> 0:00:37,960
 12 of them run from outside the game team.

6
0:00:37,960 --> 0:00:43,920
 We would like more diversity in the categories, so the more who send in categories, the better

7
0:00:43,920 --> 0:00:46,100
 HackerJBD will become.

8
0:00:46,100 --> 0:00:49,080
 We experimented this year with a lot of new kind of categories.

9
0:00:49,080 --> 0:00:57,380
 We had a lot of constructive and positive feedback, so we are happy about that.

10
0:00:57,380 --> 0:00:58,380
 But

11
0:00:58,380 --> 0:01:03,260
 we think that we have gotten, both this year and earlier years, we need more network and

12
0:01:03,260 --> 0:01:06,020
 cybersecurity related topics.

13
0:01:06,020 --> 0:01:11,880
 So if anyone has any ideas, please contact us and give us some good categories with these

14
0:01:11,880 --> 0:01:14,880
 subjects.

15
0:01:14,880 --> 0:01:21,140
 So the token game this year, well, we had 17 tokens.

16
0:01:21,140 --> 0:01:26,380
 When the token game kind of dies out and nobody finds the token, yeah, it's kind of hard to

17
0:01:26,380 --> 0:01:27,380
 make new ones.

18
0:01:27,380 --> 0:01:31,400
 If people can't find them, then the fun stops.

19
0:01:31,400 --> 0:01:39,700
 We had almost the same participants as last year, but we didn't have as many registrations.

20
0:01:39,700 --> 0:01:46,900
 And an average of two tokens per participant is somewhat different than last year.

21
0:01:46,900 --> 0:01:50,480
 And only one participant found more than 10 tokens.

22
0:01:50,480 --> 0:01:54,200
 And nobody found more than 14 tokens.

23
0:01:54,200 --> 0:01:55,880
 And nobody found all tokens.

24
0:01:55,880 --> 0:01:56,880
 That's a little sad.

25
0:01:56,880 --> 0:02:01,000
 That's a little sad.

26
0:02:01,000 --> 0:02:04,100
 We had some different tokens here this year.

27
0:02:04,100 --> 0:02:09,460
 Hafnium made the handspring and it had a token hidden.

28
0:02:09,460 --> 0:02:12,360
 It took a while for people to figure that out.

29
0:02:12,360 --> 0:02:20,720
 We also had another, the movie of the day, there was some metadata hiding a token.

30
0:02:20,720 --> 0:02:21,720
 And then there was this one.

31
0:02:21,720 --> 0:02:22,900
 There were some token participants that called me evil for the first time.

32
0:02:22,900 --> 0:02:23,900
 And then there was this one.

33
0:02:23,900 --> 0:02:24,900
 There were some token participants that called me evil for the first time.

34
0:02:24,900 --> 0:02:25,900
 And then there was this one.

35
0:02:25,900 --> 0:02:28,580
 They called me evil for making this.

36
0:02:28,580 --> 0:02:32,620
 But I was quite happy when 8dot one evening contacted me.

37
0:02:32,620 --> 0:02:37,760
 He was like he walked by and he looked at it and then was like, huh, and he actually

38
0:02:37,760 --> 0:02:40,040
 figured it out without finding all the hints.

39
0:02:40,040 --> 0:02:45,600
 So this was part of a bigger token game thing.

40
0:02:45,600 --> 0:02:48,340
 So the QR code was a token itself.

41
0:02:48,340 --> 0:02:52,580
 But if your base64 coded it, it told you to follow the lights.

42
0:02:52,580 --> 0:02:55,740
 The lights had two valid tokens.

43
0:02:55,740 --> 0:03:02,220
 25 invalid tokens unfortunately because we are missing input validation on the

44
0:03:02,220 --> 0:03:06,480
 token system so I didn't catch that error. I'm sorry about that. The tokens

45
0:03:06,480 --> 0:03:11,700
 have been removed from the system but if you followed those you would find a

46
0:03:11,700 --> 0:03:16,240
 number, a color and something that looked like a token that also told you

47
0:03:16,240 --> 0:03:22,320
 something about what the hell these number were. I'm not going to give it out

48
0:03:22,320 --> 0:03:29,280
 because I think somebody want to play with it still but if you followed from

49
0:03:29,280 --> 0:03:36,360
 the start of the main road to the end of main road you would have it if you took

50
0:03:36,360 --> 0:03:40,820
 the number in sequence have a token but at the end of main road there was a QR

51
0:03:40,820 --> 0:03:47,220
 code telling you the hint down below and that's actually also a token in

52
0:03:47,220 --> 0:03:52,320
 itself but if you use that you could correlate the colors and then

53
0:03:52,320 --> 0:03:58,640
 if the exchange them for the num numbers and you had a token. And if you

54
0:03:58,640 --> 0:04:07,020
 also base64 decoded all other texts that look like tokens you would have

55
0:04:07,020 --> 0:04:16,260
 had hints for how to decipher the wall of numbers at infoDesk. So yeah

56
0:04:16,260 --> 0:04:19,320
 lessons learned we need input validation on the token system that's very

57
0:04:19,320 --> 0:04:22,280
 important. There's a huge crossover between

58
0:04:22,320 --> 0:04:29,680
 continuing the CTF and the token game players, and that seems to have removed some players

59
0:04:29,680 --> 0:04:33,480
 from the token game this year because they focused on the CTF.

60
0:04:33,480 --> 0:04:37,680
 That's what happens, but we need to figure out how to balance that more.

61
0:04:37,680 --> 0:04:44,860
 Then we need not to hide tokens behind paywalls, so we had a Minecraft token and not everybody

62
0:04:44,860 --> 0:04:48,340
 owns Minecraft, so that's an important lesson.

63
0:04:48,340 --> 0:04:55,020
 Also, and I didn't know this, I posted a token on Twitter, and apparently it was marked

64
0:04:55,020 --> 0:05:00,720
 sensitive content for some reason, so people couldn't find it without having a Twitter

65
0:05:00,720 --> 0:05:05,720
 account and removing the filter for sensitive content, so that's not something we're going

66
0:05:05,720 --> 0:05:07,960
 to do again.

67
0:05:07,960 --> 0:05:12,640
 If possible, we need to prepare more tokens for next year, and we need to announce the

68
0:05:12,640 --> 0:05:16,740
 token game more clearly so people know it's on and what it is about.

69
0:05:18,340 --> 0:05:24,980
 Yeah, nobody found the cyber bunny, and I'm not going to go into details about the cyber

70
0:05:24,980 --> 0:05:25,980
 bunny.

71
0:05:25,980 --> 0:05:28,780
 Maybe he'll be back next year.

72
0:05:28,780 --> 0:05:30,860
 Any question about the token game?

73
0:05:30,860 --> 0:05:37,340
 There's a person here that has no video on that.

74
0:05:37,340 --> 0:05:38,340
 Wait a minute.

75
0:05:38,340 --> 0:05:42,040
 Look at the microphone.

76
0:05:42,040 --> 0:05:45,020
 I did manage to find the cyber bunny in the end.

77
0:05:45,020 --> 0:05:46,960
 But there's also...

78
0:05:46,960 --> 0:05:48,140
 Okay.

79
0:05:48,140 --> 0:05:51,900
 What other video token left I would like some hints on?

80
0:05:51,900 --> 0:05:53,580
 Should I just reveal it?

81
0:05:53,580 --> 0:05:58,000
 Well, if you look at the schedule for this talk, you will find it immediately.

82
0:05:58,000 --> 0:06:06,580
 With a bit of work behind it, but yeah, you have to reverse some things.

83
0:06:06,580 --> 0:06:10,780
 Any more questions about the token game?

84
0:06:10,780 --> 0:06:12,080
 Excellent.

85
0:06:12,080 --> 0:06:13,080
 Yeah.

86
0:06:13,080 --> 0:06:15,780
 So, like last year.

87
0:06:15,780 --> 0:06:16,780
 We...

88
0:06:16,780 --> 0:06:17,780
 Okay.

89
0:06:17,780 --> 0:06:20,420
 So, we have the same Pixabook machine.

90
0:06:20,420 --> 0:06:24,540
 It can do 80 gigabit per second.

91
0:06:24,540 --> 0:06:25,540
 This year, we...

92
0:06:25,540 --> 0:06:33,520
 I have a graph of it in a second, but we peaked about 30% of utilization of it.

93
0:06:33,520 --> 0:06:42,660
 This year, compared to last year, we had multiple 10 gigabit clients, which was nice.

94
0:06:42,660 --> 0:06:46,780
 You were being punished this year as well if you used IPv4.

95
0:06:46,780 --> 0:06:47,780
 Okay.

96
0:06:47,780 --> 0:06:48,780
 And instead of IPv6.

97
0:06:48,780 --> 0:06:49,780
 So, I fixed my clients, finally, and stuff worked.

98
0:06:49,780 --> 0:06:50,780
 So, we had two interactive games that were created by J-Wolf.

99
0:06:50,780 --> 0:06:51,780
 One was Pong, and one was Snake.

100
0:06:51,780 --> 0:06:52,780
 You can still play them if you want to.

101
0:06:52,780 --> 0:06:53,780
 Just go up and grab a controller and a friend to play Pong.

102
0:06:53,780 --> 0:06:54,780
 Yeah.

103
0:06:54,780 --> 0:06:55,780
 We made it so you could live stream.

104
0:06:55,780 --> 0:06:56,780
 Did you have any questions?

105
0:06:56,780 --> 0:06:57,780
 No.

106
0:06:57,780 --> 0:06:58,780
 Okay.

107
0:06:58,780 --> 0:06:59,780
 Okay.

108
0:06:59,780 --> 0:07:00,780
 Thank you.

109
0:07:00,780 --> 0:07:01,780
 Thank you.

110
0:07:01,780 --> 0:07:02,780
 Thank you.

111
0:07:02,780 --> 0:07:03,780
 Thank you.

112
0:07:03,780 --> 0:07:04,780
 Thank you.

113
0:07:04,780 --> 0:07:05,780
 Thank you.

114
0:07:05,780 --> 0:07:06,780
 Thank you.

115
0:07:06,780 --> 0:07:07,780
 Thank you.

116
0:07:07,780 --> 0:07:08,780
 Thank you.

117
0:07:08,780 --> 0:07:09,780
 Thank you.

118
0:07:09,780 --> 0:07:10,780
 Thank you.

119
0:07:10,780 --> 0:07:11,780
 Thank you.

120
0:07:11,780 --> 0:07:12,780
 Thank you.

121
0:07:12,780 --> 0:07:13,780
 Thank you.

122
0:07:13,780 --> 0:07:14,780
 Thank you.

123
0:07:14,780 --> 0:07:15,780
 Thank you.

124
0:07:15,780 --> 0:07:16,780
 Thank you.

125
0:07:16,780 --> 0:07:17,780
 Thank you.

126
0:07:17,780 --> 0:07:18,780
 Thank you.

127
0:07:18,780 --> 0:07:19,780
 Thank you.

128
0:07:19,780 --> 0:07:20,780
 Okay.

129
0:07:20,780 --> 0:07:21,780
 Okay.

130
0:07:21,780 --> 0:07:22,780
 Thank you.

131
0:07:22,780 --> 0:07:23,780
 So, it was really, really good.

132
0:07:23,780 --> 0:07:24,780
 It's a great idea.

133
0:07:24,780 --> 0:07:25,780
 It was great.

134
0:07:25,780 --> 0:07:26,780
 So, we have this one last idea here.

135
0:07:26,780 --> 0:07:27,780
 So, let's just go back.

136
0:07:27,780 --> 0:07:28,780
 Let's start with the pixel flute.

137
0:07:28,780 --> 0:07:29,780
 At live.bunhack.dk slash pixel flute.

138
0:07:29,780 --> 0:07:30,900
 So, and you can also stream it on multicaster presses just because we can.

139
0:07:30,900 --> 0:07:43,020
 So, we had one movie that were being displayed on the pixel flutes and later it was also

140
0:07:43,020 --> 0:07:46,780
 converted into some streaming of the Jeopardy games.

141
0:07:46,780 --> 0:07:47,780
 Okay.

142
0:07:47,780 --> 0:08:01,160
 Most of the traffic was sent from a switch that was at the Pixelfluid server, but we

143
0:08:01,160 --> 0:08:10,500
 also had a machine and regular camping that sent on average 7.1 gigabit per second.

144
0:08:10,500 --> 0:08:16,540
 This image shows bits per second, if you can read it.

145
0:08:16,540 --> 0:08:21,540
 This is around 26 gigabits.

146
0:08:21,540 --> 0:08:22,540
 That's pretty nice.

147
0:08:22,540 --> 0:08:24,740
 That's better than last year.

148
0:08:24,740 --> 0:08:28,380
 We still need to use more bandwidth, though.

149
0:08:28,380 --> 0:08:33,460
 You can do 80 gigabit on it, so bring some 10 gigabit machines with you next year.

150
0:08:33,460 --> 0:08:40,060
 We may be able to help you create a client if you haven't done so already.

151
0:08:40,060 --> 0:08:40,440
 Just give some...

152
0:08:40,500 --> 0:08:44,440
 Some hints on what to do.

153
0:08:44,440 --> 0:08:48,180
 And this is packets per second.

154
0:08:48,180 --> 0:08:51,980
 It's around 2.6 million packets per second.

155
0:08:51,980 --> 0:08:54,820
 That's pretty okay.

156
0:08:54,820 --> 0:09:01,680
 Yeah, so this year we had a new gaming experience.

157
0:09:01,680 --> 0:09:06,220
 It was 10 Cattles by Melinda.

158
0:09:06,220 --> 0:09:09,060
 It was up in Kochi at night.

159
0:09:09,060 --> 0:09:10,060
 There were two sessions.

160
0:09:10,060 --> 0:09:14,000
 One last evening and the one the evening before.

161
0:09:14,000 --> 0:09:15,000
 I participated in the first one.

162
0:09:15,000 --> 0:09:23,580
 It was quite nice, and we're definitely going to try and make more of such events next year.

163
0:09:23,580 --> 0:09:24,580
 So yeah, next year.

164
0:09:24,580 --> 0:09:29,140
 And we're still doing Hackathopity, of course, and the token game.

165
0:09:29,140 --> 0:09:30,820
 We want more games like 10 Cattles.

166
0:09:30,820 --> 0:09:36,660
 So if anybody here knows something about some games that are easy to play and easy to set

167
0:09:36,660 --> 0:09:38,000
 up and could be nice for an evening in the dark...

168
0:09:38,000 --> 0:09:39,000
 Yeah.

169
0:09:39,000 --> 0:09:40,000
 Yeah.

170
0:09:40,000 --> 0:09:42,300
 Then let us know.

171
0:09:42,300 --> 0:09:47,940
 We're going to try and meet before the camp next year to plan stuff beforehand.

172
0:09:47,940 --> 0:09:51,400
 Especially with Hackathopity.

173
0:09:51,400 --> 0:09:55,560
 So we don't have to make everything during the camp.

174
0:09:55,560 --> 0:09:57,160
 And yeah, we want more game activities.

175
0:09:57,160 --> 0:10:00,720
 So if anybody has any ideas, you don't have to join the game team.

176
0:10:00,720 --> 0:10:06,940
 But if you want to join the game team and do anything, please do so.

177
0:10:06,940 --> 0:10:07,940
 Yeah.

178
0:10:07,940 --> 0:10:08,940
 Any questions?

179
0:10:08,940 --> 0:10:09,940
 No.

180
0:10:09,940 --> 0:10:10,940
 Do we have questions for the team?

181
0:10:10,940 --> 0:10:11,940
 Okay.

182
0:10:11,940 --> 0:10:12,940
 I see no hands.

183
0:10:12,940 --> 0:10:13,940
 Let's give a round of applause for the game team.

184
0:10:13,940 --> 0:10:14,940
 Do you have another slide?

185
0:10:14,940 --> 0:10:15,940
 Would you?

186
0:10:15,940 --> 0:10:16,940
 No.

187
0:10:16,940 --> 0:10:17,940
 Well, we would also like to announce the winner of Token Hunt.

188
0:10:17,940 --> 0:10:18,940
 Oh, yeah.

189
0:10:18,940 --> 0:10:19,940
 Right.

190
0:10:19,940 --> 0:10:20,940
 Sorry.

191
0:10:20,940 --> 0:10:21,940
 Sorry.

192
0:10:21,940 --> 0:10:22,940
 Sorry.

193
0:10:22,940 --> 0:10:23,940
 Sorry.

194
0:10:23,940 --> 0:10:24,940
 So there is a winner of the Token Hunt.

195
0:10:24,940 --> 0:10:25,940
 And the winner is getting a ticket for next year's Spawn Hack.

196
0:10:25,940 --> 0:10:26,940
 8Dot is the winner of this year's Spawn Hack.

197
0:10:26,940 --> 0:10:27,940
 8Dot.

198
0:10:27,940 --> 0:10:28,940
 8Dot.

199
0:10:28,940 --> 0:10:29,940
 8Dot.

200
0:10:29,940 --> 0:10:30,940
 8Dot.

201
0:10:30,940 --> 0:10:31,940
 8Dot.

202
0:10:31,940 --> 0:10:32,940
 8Dot.

203
0:10:32,940 --> 0:10:33,940
 8Dot.

204
0:10:33,940 --> 0:10:34,940
 8Dot.

205
0:10:34,940 --> 0:10:35,940
 8Dot.

206
0:10:35,940 --> 0:10:36,940
 8Dot.

207
0:10:36,940 --> 0:10:37,940
 8Dot.

208
0:10:37,940 --> 0:10:38,940
 8Dot.

209
0:10:38,940 --> 0:10:39,940
 8Dot.

210
0:10:39,940 --> 0:10:40,940
 8Dot.

211
0:10:40,940 --> 0:10:41,940
 8Dot.

212
0:10:41,940 --> 0:10:42,940
 8Dot.

213
0:10:42,940 --> 0:10:43,940
 8Dot.

214
0:10:43,940 --> 0:10:44,940
 8Dot.

215
0:10:44,940 --> 0:10:45,940
 Yes.

216
0:10:45,940 --> 0:10:46,940
 It's the winner of this year's Spawn Hack.

217
0:10:46,940 --> 0:10:47,940
 Absolutely the most tokens found.

218
0:10:47,940 --> 0:10:48,940
 So if you found the cyber bunny, then you are now up to 15 tokens out of 17 tokens.

219
0:10:48,940 --> 0:10:49,940
 So that's quite nice.

220
0:10:49,940 --> 0:10:50,940
 Yes.

221
0:10:50,940 --> 0:10:51,940
 Thank you.

222
0:10:51,940 --> 0:10:52,940
 Thank you.

223
0:10:52,940 --> 0:10:53,940
 Thank you.

224
0:10:53,940 --> 0:10:54,940
 Thank you.
