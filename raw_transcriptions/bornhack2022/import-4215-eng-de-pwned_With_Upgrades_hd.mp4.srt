0:00:15,000 --> 0:00:17,000
 Hi.

3
0:00:17,000 --> 0:00:21,000
 0, 1, 0, 1, 2, check, check.

4
0:00:21,000 --> 0:00:22,000
 So, this is working.

5
0:00:22,000 --> 0:00:25,000
 Hello everybody and thank you to the organizers

6
0:00:25,000 --> 0:00:27,000
 for doing a very great job,

7
0:00:27,000 --> 0:00:29,000
 having a very great camp for all of us

8
0:00:29,000 --> 0:00:31,000
 where we can talk.

9
0:00:31,000 --> 0:00:33,000
 And first of all,

10
0:00:33,000 --> 0:00:35,000
 SkÃ¥l!

11
0:00:39,000 --> 0:00:41,000
 So, quickly, about me.

12
0:00:41,000 --> 0:00:43,000
 My name is Chris K.

13
0:00:43,000 --> 0:00:45,000
 And I'll be staring a lot at the screen because I'm nervous.

14
0:00:45,000 --> 0:00:49,000
 I'm a nerd and I work at the Leibniz Supercomputing Center,

15
0:00:49,000 --> 0:00:51,000
 which is actually the Leibniz Rechenzentrum,

16
0:00:51,000 --> 0:00:53,000
 which is actually LRZ.

17
0:00:53,000 --> 0:00:57,000
 And the LRZ is a data center

18
0:00:57,000 --> 0:00:59,000
 that does IT infrastructure for

19
0:00:59,000 --> 0:01:03,000
 all the universities in Munich and around Munich.

20
0:01:03,000 --> 0:01:05,000
 And I work on IDM,

21
0:01:05,000 --> 0:01:07,000
 which is identity management,

22
0:01:07,000 --> 0:01:09,000
 which is passwords and usernames and permissions.

23
0:01:09,000 --> 0:01:11,000
 And I like hacker camps,

24
0:01:11,000 --> 0:01:13,000
 which is why I'm here and talking to you right now.

25
0:01:13,000 --> 0:01:15,000
 Hello.

26
0:01:15,000 --> 0:01:17,000
 And quickly a slide of what we're doing.

27
0:01:17,000 --> 0:01:18,000
 I just copied that.

28
0:01:18,000 --> 0:01:19,000
 It's from last year.

29
0:01:19,000 --> 0:01:22,000
 We're doing 59 years of IT support in Munich

30
0:01:22,000 --> 0:01:24,000
 and there's nothing special standing out here.

31
0:01:24,000 --> 0:01:27,000
 All just usual things.

32
0:01:27,000 --> 0:01:29,000
 Oh, I just noticed.

33
0:01:29,000 --> 0:01:31,000
 Last year was 59.

34
0:01:31,000 --> 0:01:33,000
 Then this year is 60.

35
0:01:33,000 --> 0:01:34,000
 Let's sing quickly.

36
0:01:34,000 --> 0:01:35,000
 Three, two, one.

37
0:01:35,000 --> 0:01:38,000
 Happy birthday to you.

38
0:01:38,000 --> 0:01:40,000
 Got no time.

39
0:01:40,000 --> 0:01:42,000
 What do you get when you have birthday?

40
0:01:42,000 --> 0:01:43,000
 You get presents.

41
0:01:43,000 --> 0:01:45,000
 And we got a few new toys.

42
0:01:45,000 --> 0:01:47,000
 For example, this single CPU computer.

43
0:01:47,000 --> 0:01:49,000
 Single CPU sounds great, right?

44
0:01:49,000 --> 0:01:50,000
 It has...

45
0:01:50,000 --> 0:01:51,000
 No.

46
0:01:51,000 --> 0:01:52,000
 No.

47
0:01:52,000 --> 0:01:53,000
 Ah, yeah.

48
0:01:53,000 --> 0:01:57,000
 It has 850,000 cores.

49
0:01:57,000 --> 0:01:59,000
 And if you want to get your hands on that,

50
0:01:59,000 --> 0:02:00,000
 there might be ways.

51
0:02:00,000 --> 0:02:02,000
 I don't know.

52
0:02:02,000 --> 0:02:06,000
 And this talk is about being deponed with upgrades.

53
0:02:06,000 --> 0:02:08,000
 But what is upgrades if you don't know

54
0:02:08,000 --> 0:02:10,000
 what without upgrades is?

55
0:02:10,000 --> 0:02:12,000
 I'm sorry.

56
0:02:12,000 --> 0:02:14,000
 So without upgrades,

57
0:02:14,000 --> 0:02:17,000
 that is the talk I gave 2019 at the hackers camp.

58
0:02:17,000 --> 0:02:19,000
 And these are all the slides.

59
0:02:19,000 --> 0:02:20,000
 You could read it quickly,

60
0:02:20,000 --> 0:02:24,000
 but there is a talk on Media CCC.

61
0:02:24,000 --> 0:02:26,000
 I'll show that at the end again.

62
0:02:26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
 And it was about taking a list of things

63
0:02:29,000 --> 0:02:31,000
 that we have to do.

64
0:02:31,000 --> 0:02:33,000
 And it was the first thing that was on the list.

65
0:02:33,000 --> 0:02:35,000
 So we had a list of known passwords,

66
0:02:35,000 --> 0:02:37,000
 the PwnPassword database,

67
0:02:37,000 --> 0:02:40,000
 and helping users not to choose any passwords

68
0:02:40,000 --> 0:02:42,000
 which are on that database.

69
0:02:42,000 --> 0:02:46,000
 So we prevent users from choosing...

70
0:02:46,000 --> 0:02:49,000
 We help users choosing less bad passwords.

71
0:02:49,000 --> 0:02:51,000
 And that closed the tab coming in

72
0:02:51,000 --> 0:02:53,000
 for coming in new bad passwords.

73
0:02:53,000 --> 0:02:56,000
 And that made everything great forever!

74
0:02:56,000 --> 0:02:57,000
 Oh, wait.

75
0:02:57,000 --> 0:02:58,000
 There's one thing.

76
0:02:58,000 --> 0:03:06,280
 And so 5 out of 11 of our security incidents recently were started with bad credentials.

77
0:03:07,940 --> 0:03:10,220
 And we don't like that.

78
0:03:11,240 --> 0:03:12,760
 So this is dark.

79
0:03:13,140 --> 0:03:14,360
 And what do we do in the darkness?

80
0:03:15,260 --> 0:03:16,480
 We write shell scripts.

81
0:03:16,860 --> 0:03:19,820
 And we stick them into the crontab and we run them weekly.

82
0:03:20,040 --> 0:03:20,980
 And then we get numbers.

83
0:03:21,420 --> 0:03:25,440
 But because managers pay our wages, we turn them into nice graphs.

84
0:03:25,440 --> 0:03:35,440
 And we see that about 8% of our install base has bad passwords on their usernames, which is about 26,000 bad credentials.

85
0:03:36,780 --> 0:03:41,480
 And we took some stats and it went worse.

86
0:03:41,700 --> 0:03:42,980
 And then it stayed the same.

87
0:03:43,160 --> 0:03:44,120
 And then it got better.

88
0:03:44,380 --> 0:03:53,060
 And then it dropped off a cliff, which is when we sent an email to all the users under our control and persuaded them to use better passwords.

89
0:03:53,060 --> 0:03:54,820
 And then it kind of stayed the same.

90
0:03:55,000 --> 0:03:55,060
 And then...

91
0:03:55,440 --> 0:03:55,840
 Oh.

92
0:03:56,620 --> 0:03:57,680
 And then it went up again.

93
0:03:58,640 --> 0:04:02,460
 Well, that was at the end of 2021.

94
0:04:02,980 --> 0:04:07,440
 And we see 2021 good apples become bad apples sometimes.

95
0:04:07,660 --> 0:04:10,280
 Except with passwords that just takes a second.

96
0:04:10,560 --> 0:04:11,680
 And what happened in that second?

97
0:04:12,100 --> 0:04:14,900
 We got a new database version of stolen passwords.

98
0:04:15,500 --> 0:04:18,620
 And it's version 8 by now.

99
0:04:18,620 --> 0:04:22,840
 And it's got 260 million more bad passwords.

100
0:04:23,060 --> 0:04:23,720
 Isn't that great?

101
0:04:24,500 --> 0:04:25,300
 And so it stays.

102
0:04:25,440 --> 0:04:26,100
 It's a little bit high.

103
0:04:26,200 --> 0:04:26,920
 It drops a bit down.

104
0:04:27,000 --> 0:04:34,200
 And then it drops off a cliff again, which is the point where we gave the list of bad passwords to...

105
0:04:34,200 --> 0:04:36,320
 No, not the list, but a list.

106
0:04:37,040 --> 0:04:37,240
 No.

107
0:04:37,880 --> 0:04:44,680
 One of our customers, a big university, asked us which user IDs that they had under their control were using bad passwords.

108
0:04:44,760 --> 0:04:45,780
 And we gave that to them.

109
0:04:46,100 --> 0:04:50,100
 And they sent emails to all of these users and persuaded them to use new passwords.

110
0:04:50,580 --> 0:04:54,920
 And that was 6,000 bad passwords basically gone in a few weeks.

111
0:04:55,440 --> 0:04:57,100
 And we like that.

112
0:04:59,100 --> 0:05:01,060
 But it's not just about us.

113
0:05:01,120 --> 0:05:02,060
 It's about you, too.

114
0:05:02,060 --> 0:05:07,720
 Because we have 45% of bad security incidents starting with bad passwords.

115
0:05:08,040 --> 0:05:09,960
 But so has the rest of the world.

116
0:05:10,320 --> 0:05:11,760
 And it's not just basically us.

117
0:05:11,900 --> 0:05:19,920
 It's almost 4,000 security incidents that have been collected by Verizon for this year's data breach investigations report.

118
0:05:20,280 --> 0:05:22,420
 And that is kind of bad.

119
0:05:23,080 --> 0:05:25,060
 But now you have possibly one.

120
0:05:25,440 --> 0:05:27,700
 One thing you can do about that.

121
0:05:28,800 --> 0:05:31,260
 But nevertheless, let's end on a high note.

122
0:05:32,080 --> 0:05:34,860
 The world's best password is still safe.

123
0:05:35,020 --> 0:05:36,440
 So you can still all use that.

124
0:05:38,660 --> 0:05:41,120
 And, yeah, that's the end of the talk.

125
0:05:41,460 --> 0:05:43,140
 There is the QR code again.

126
0:05:43,460 --> 0:05:48,880
 And if there's any need, I can talk to you about EVs, so electric vehicles.

127
0:05:49,300 --> 0:05:50,480
 I'm a bit of a fan.

128
0:05:50,640 --> 0:05:53,120
 And if you have questions, want to buy your own, just nerd out.

129
0:05:53,120 --> 0:05:54,420
 Come by and say hello.

130
0:05:55,440 --> 0:05:55,900
 That's it.

131
0:05:56,040 --> 0:05:56,440
 Thank you.

132
0:05:56,440 --> 0:05:56,480
 Thank you.

133
0:05:57,080 --> 0:05:57,440
 Thank you.

134
0:05:57,440 --> 0:05:58,640
 Thank you.
