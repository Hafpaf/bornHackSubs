0:00:00,000 --> 0:00:24,980
 Oh, all right. Yes, welcome to this talk. I have created a piece of software that I want to talk to you about.

2
0:00:24,980 --> 0:00:40,460
 So, I have this problem, or I had this problem, that I sometimes take photos and video, and then I have to store it somewhere, and not only do I have to access it, I have to share it with friends and family, and they have to access it.

3
0:00:40,720 --> 0:00:51,880
 And there are multiple existing solutions, both free and open source, and proprietary and commercial, and I think all of them are bad for me, because most of them seem quite bloated.

4
0:00:51,880 --> 0:01:09,180
 But it's always the case that I enter this kind of web interface, and then there are so many buttons, and I don't know which one to click, and there are too many options and too many possibilities, and the only thing I really want to be able to do is have a look at a page where the photos are, and then share that page.

5
0:01:11,580 --> 0:01:21,220
 So, my goal is kind of to separate the different aspects of sharing photos and video, so I want a place to store the media.

6
0:01:21,880 --> 0:01:41,300
 That is one place, then I want a place to store the code for showing this, for sharing this, and then I want a place to store the configuration, that is, what media is available for this group of people, and what media is available for this group of people, and what media is available just for me.

7
0:01:41,580 --> 0:01:50,640
 And I want that to be stored in a nice and manageable configuration, so I don't have to click around on some kind of web page and configure things.

8
0:01:51,880 --> 0:02:14,880
 So, to pick a storage thing, I wanted to do something that is stable and popular, and has many tools that enables me to just quickly make something work, and apparently that seems to be SSS, S3, it's an AWS technology, but there are many clones out there, so you're not kind of limited to one provider.

9
0:02:15,080 --> 0:02:18,540
 I'm using some random provider that I found, which works fine.

10
0:02:19,340 --> 0:02:21,820
 And then the next thing to pick.

11
0:02:22,080 --> 0:02:31,120
 Was which technology is used for the configuration file, and I also tried to pick something that was ubiquitous and popular, and that was JSON.

12
0:02:32,020 --> 0:02:38,140
 There's also this YAML, but I never got around to that, it seems very complicated, so JSON is much simpler.

13
0:02:39,440 --> 0:02:42,480
 Alright, so I want to demo this a bit.

14
0:02:43,220 --> 0:02:44,040
 I took some screenshots.

15
0:02:44,580 --> 0:02:51,800
 So, I set up an example server on my laptop.

16
0:02:52,080 --> 0:03:05,120
 So, this is a bit small, but the point is that up here I have written the address, and then what happens when you try to enter this, and imagine this is like a public website, you just get this not found.

17
0:03:05,320 --> 0:03:12,660
 And that's because I want, by default, all media to be hidden from you.

18
0:03:12,840 --> 0:03:20,400
 I mean, if I want to explicitly do something in my configuration file, if I am to share this with other people.

19
0:03:20,900 --> 0:03:21,120
 So, by default, this just...

20
0:03:21,880 --> 0:03:36,360
 But then I have this command, roundworm, get share URL, and then I pass the JSON file, the configuration file, and then this empty string, which designates the root of the website.

21
0:03:36,920 --> 0:03:47,260
 And then I get this URL back up here, which is the same, but now there's a digest, and it also asks for a username and a password, which I then enter.

22
0:03:47,660 --> 0:03:50,660
 And then I get this nice listing.

23
0:03:51,360 --> 0:03:51,420
 Nice.

24
0:03:51,420 --> 0:03:51,440
 Nice.

25
0:03:51,440 --> 0:03:51,460
 Nice.

26
0:03:51,460 --> 0:03:51,480
 Nice.

27
0:03:51,480 --> 0:03:51,580
 Nice.

28
0:03:51,580 --> 0:03:51,600
 Nice.

29
0:03:51,600 --> 0:03:51,620
 Nice.

30
0:03:51,620 --> 0:03:51,860
 Nice.

31
0:03:51,880 --> 0:03:53,160
 Now, there are two directories here.

32
0:03:53,260 --> 0:04:00,880
 There's public and unlisted, and those are directories that I have configured and also made sure to exist on my S3 storage.

33
0:04:01,460 --> 0:04:07,720
 It's not super important, but we can try to click on unlisted, and then we get into this secondary view.

34
0:04:07,940 --> 0:04:15,380
 So, now we have this nested view, and this is still kind of uninteresting, but I have a feature made whereby you can view the thumbnails.

35
0:04:16,360 --> 0:04:21,380
 So, now you click on thumbnails, and now we are looking at the directory for boneheaders.

36
0:04:21,880 --> 0:04:23,140
 In fact, we're still at 12.

37
0:04:23,520 --> 0:04:25,600
 And we can see the URL in the URL and

38
0:04:25,600 --> 0:04:27,580
 we're going to let it forward now.

39
0:04:28,180 --> 0:04:29,440
 So, there's a key there.

40
0:04:29,440 --> 0:04:29,900
 And there's my last item.

41
0:04:30,320 --> 0:04:32,880
 And then, once I've hit this button here, it says腕 case.

42
0:04:33,160 --> 0:04:34,640
 That's my shortcut to go to my wall.

43
0:04:34,640 --> 0:04:34,860
 Yeah.

44
0:04:35,180 --> 0:04:38,540
 And then Mike's added staying local address for this CC.

45
0:04:38,720 --> 0:04:43,460
 And next, I'm going to after green and right-click again on SSU.

46
0:04:44,580 --> 0:04:48,300
 On the left, I have myaczk本当 cool, and 11151 Digest Active.

47
0:04:48,300 --> 0:04:48,680
 That's theumizen.

48
0:04:48,680 --> 0:04:50,160
 One next very cool thing, but I don't want to out짖 transformative, so let me interesting,

49
0:04:50,160 --> 0:04:53,320
 You can see there's still a link here to go back.

50
0:04:54,620 --> 0:04:57,620
 And that's because the digest still allows one to go back.

51
0:04:58,040 --> 0:05:02,500
 So the use case right now is that I would like to share only this page.

52
0:05:03,560 --> 0:05:08,540
 And I can share this directory down here,

53
0:05:08,540 --> 0:05:15,740
 which will create a new digest that only allows access to unlisted slash BornHack 2020.

54
0:05:15,740 --> 0:05:23,060
 So if I paste that and copy it up into the address bar,

55
0:05:23,400 --> 0:05:28,340
 then we get the same view, but now there's not anymore a link back to up the directory,

56
0:05:28,740 --> 0:05:33,600
 because now we have this specific URL with this specific digest

57
0:05:33,600 --> 0:05:36,000
 that only allows access to this specific prefix.

58
0:05:37,120 --> 0:05:38,820
 And that's pretty simple, I think.

59
0:05:40,200 --> 0:05:44,460
 We can also, I also made, oh yeah, you can click on the pictures and then they will show up.

60
0:05:45,740 --> 0:05:50,720
 So I also made this public directory, which has different semantics, you can say.

61
0:05:51,160 --> 0:05:53,880
 And I used this get share URL once more.

62
0:05:54,420 --> 0:06:00,140
 And now I pass this public at the end of the command line as the final option.

63
0:06:00,140 --> 0:06:03,740
 And that gives me this URL.

64
0:06:03,960 --> 0:06:07,460
 So up here now it's this host and then it's slash public.

65
0:06:07,800 --> 0:06:13,160
 And then I have a digest specifically for accessing only this slash public prefix.

66
0:06:14,020 --> 0:06:15,700
 I have configured slash.

67
0:06:15,740 --> 0:06:19,000
 Public differently from slash unlisted.

68
0:06:20,320 --> 0:06:26,420
 Such that in this view, you can, if you have the path to a file,

69
0:06:26,840 --> 0:06:30,500
 you can just use that path directly without having to specify a digest.

70
0:06:31,080 --> 0:06:35,560
 But if you have a directory beneath this public prefix,

71
0:06:35,560 --> 0:06:39,840
 you still have to specify a digest.

72
0:06:41,500 --> 0:06:44,880
 So if I just try to access this public without a digest,

73
0:06:45,040 --> 0:06:45,720
 I will get a not found.

74
0:06:45,980 --> 0:06:50,740
 But if I try to access public slash and then a file name, it will show the file.

75
0:06:51,880 --> 0:06:56,500
 So what I just demoed was configured in this single configuration file in JSON.

76
0:06:57,140 --> 0:06:58,600
 And I can just split it up.

77
0:06:58,780 --> 0:07:03,200
 So first we have some S3 specific access tokens and such.

78
0:07:03,740 --> 0:07:05,960
 And where I'm storing the media.

79
0:07:06,760 --> 0:07:11,140
 And then we have some specifics about where this is hosted on my server.

80
0:07:12,280 --> 0:07:15,520
 And then we have these prefixes, which detail,

81
0:07:15,740 --> 0:07:19,320
 what and how I'm sharing.

82
0:07:19,820 --> 0:07:22,740
 So specifically, I have three levels of authentication.

83
0:07:23,060 --> 0:07:26,300
 There's none, which is just readily available for anyone with the URL.

84
0:07:26,720 --> 0:07:30,080
 And then we have sign, which requires this digest to be provided.

85
0:07:30,580 --> 0:07:35,360
 And then we have HTTP, which requires the digest and an HTTP login as well.

86
0:07:37,700 --> 0:07:40,700
 So the full feature is really just, you can view it and you can view thumbnails

87
0:07:40,700 --> 0:07:42,080
 and you can share the URLs and that's it.

88
0:07:43,040 --> 0:07:44,060
 So in conclusion,

89
0:07:44,140 --> 0:07:45,100
 I have been using this for, you know, a couple of years now.

90
0:07:45,100 --> 0:07:45,300
 I have been using this for, you know, a couple of years now.

91
0:07:45,300 --> 0:07:45,400
 I have been using this for, you know, a couple of years now.

92
0:07:45,400 --> 0:07:45,520
 I have been using this for, you know, a couple of years now.

93
0:07:45,520 --> 0:07:47,440
 I have been using this for a year or so, and it works.

94
0:07:48,240 --> 0:07:50,620
 But it's really just one large Python script,

95
0:07:50,760 --> 0:07:52,460
 and I'm not too happy about the code,

96
0:07:52,560 --> 0:07:54,100
 so I wouldn't recommend using it.

97
0:07:54,640 --> 0:07:56,500
 But the base functionality is quite nice.

98
0:07:57,960 --> 0:07:58,840
 Yeah, thank you.

99
0:08:00,840 --> 0:08:01,240
 Applause
