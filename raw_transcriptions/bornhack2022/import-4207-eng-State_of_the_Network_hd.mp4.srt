 Tanya Cushman Reviewer:"Presenter":

2
0:00:14,520 --> 0:00:18,000
 Yes, I, of course, don't feel any pressure

3
0:00:18,000 --> 0:00:21,120
 since I just saw the pyjamas presentation,

4
0:00:21,120 --> 0:00:24,000
 so, okay, I'll try to live up to it.

5
0:00:24,000 --> 0:00:31,000
 Anyway, I have, this is Hypnotoad, he appeared last year,

6
0:00:31,000 --> 0:00:34,000
 he will appear next year also.

7
0:00:34,000 --> 0:00:36,000
 You will thank your NOC team.

8
0:00:36,000 --> 0:00:39,000
 Thank you, NOC team.

9
0:00:43,000 --> 0:00:47,000
 Okay, so, as some of you may have heard,

10
0:00:47,000 --> 0:00:52,000
 we, in the recent years, have been saying something about use more bandwidth.

11
0:00:52,000 --> 0:00:53,000
 And,

12
0:00:54,000 --> 0:00:59,000
 and we have for years and years and years and years

13
0:00:59,000 --> 0:01:01,000
 been saying use more bandwidth.

14
0:01:01,000 --> 0:01:03,000
 I'm not going to say that this year.

15
0:01:05,000 --> 0:01:09,000
 Because we actually hit more than 9 gigabits, you know.

16
0:01:09,000 --> 0:01:11,000
 You can see over here.

17
0:01:13,000 --> 0:01:17,000
 We have a maximum outbound of 7 point,

18
0:01:17,000 --> 0:01:19,000
 sorry, 9.76 gigabits.

19
0:01:20,000 --> 0:01:21,000
 I think...

20
0:01:24,000 --> 0:01:27,000
 So,

21
0:01:27,000 --> 0:01:29,000
 So,

22
0:01:29,000 --> 0:01:35,000
 there's another thing that is actually super impressive about this.

23
0:01:35,000 --> 0:01:39,000
 That is that we got a 3 gigabit connection from Global Connect.

24
0:01:41,000 --> 0:01:46,000
 We're just happy that somewhere in the system there's a misconfiguration,

25
0:01:46,000 --> 0:01:48,000
 and we won't tell anyone.

26
0:01:49,000 --> 0:01:53,000
 So, apparently, some people have heard our call for use more bandwidth,

27
0:01:53,000 --> 0:01:55,000
 and apparently, it succeeded.

28
0:01:55,000 --> 0:01:57,000
 I think this is very, very cool.

29
0:01:57,000 --> 0:01:59,000
 We'll, of course, get a bit back to that.

30
0:01:59,000 --> 0:02:01,000
 But, first, let me show you what we did last year.

31
0:02:07,000 --> 0:02:08,000
 Anyway.

32
0:02:08,000 --> 0:02:12,000
 So, yes, there was some spike at, I don't know what happened,

33
0:02:12,000 --> 0:02:16,000
 but the rest of the camp, this is 0.2G, right?

34
0:02:16,000 --> 0:02:18,000
 0.2.

35
0:02:18,000 --> 0:02:20,000
 So, let's compare it to what we've done this year.

36
0:02:20,000 --> 0:02:26,000
 Oh, 0.2 would be here-ish, right?

37
0:02:26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
 I think you heard our call, and you came through,

38
0:02:31,000 --> 0:02:33,000
 and that's very, very cool.

39
0:02:34,000 --> 0:02:37,000
 And when we see a graph like this,

40
0:02:37,000 --> 0:02:40,000
 you see that apparently some people have been playing and doing weird shit,

41
0:02:40,000 --> 0:02:41,000
 and that's super nice.

42
0:02:41,000 --> 0:02:42,000
 That's why we're here.

43
0:02:42,000 --> 0:02:48,000
 But also, this background thing is actually noticeable, right?

44
0:02:48,000 --> 0:02:50,000
 So, if we look at the blue one,

45
0:02:50,000 --> 0:02:51,000
 that is the uplink.

46
0:02:51,000 --> 0:02:54,000
 That is just something running all the time.

47
0:02:54,000 --> 0:02:57,000
 And that's basically...

48
0:02:57,000 --> 0:02:58,000
 I know what it is.

49
0:02:58,000 --> 0:02:59,000
 We'll get to that later.

50
0:02:59,000 --> 0:03:00,000
 But it's very cool.

51
0:03:00,000 --> 0:03:01,000
 That's why we're here.

52
0:03:01,000 --> 0:03:04,000
 So, we have a couple of hundred megabits that is just used all the time,

53
0:03:04,000 --> 0:03:07,000
 and then all the jitter is people doing weird shit, right?

54
0:03:07,000 --> 0:03:09,000
 And then we have something like this.

55
0:03:09,000 --> 0:03:11,000
 This would be in the middle of the night, for example.

56
0:03:11,000 --> 0:03:14,000
 We don't have people using the network much.

57
0:03:14,000 --> 0:03:16,000
 People are probably sleeping.

58
0:03:16,000 --> 0:03:18,000
 But still, there is some service running.

59
0:03:18,000 --> 0:03:19,000
 And that's...

60
0:03:19,000 --> 0:03:20,000
 Noticeable.

61
0:03:20,000 --> 0:03:23,000
 And it uses more bandwidth than we did last year.

62
0:03:23,000 --> 0:03:25,000
 Than everybody did last year.

63
0:03:25,000 --> 0:03:26,000
 So, it's just...

64
0:03:26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
 Yes!

65
0:03:27,000 --> 0:03:28,000
 Thank you!

66
0:03:35,000 --> 0:03:36,000
 Okay.

67
0:03:36,000 --> 0:03:37,000
 And then...

68
0:03:37,000 --> 0:03:40,000
 Back to our regular scheduled program.

69
0:03:40,000 --> 0:03:43,000
 We, of course, here at BornHack, have a NOC team.

70
0:03:43,000 --> 0:03:46,000
 That was a thing that I would very much like to mention,

71
0:03:46,000 --> 0:03:48,000
 because I find it to be really cool.

72
0:03:48,000 --> 0:03:50,000
 And it really worked for me this year.

73
0:03:50,000 --> 0:03:55,000
 So, what we basically did was that we had close to three teams that did some work.

74
0:03:55,000 --> 0:03:59,000
 We had the AP people who set up these access points.

75
0:03:59,000 --> 0:04:02,000
 You guys must have been walking so many kilometers.

76
0:04:02,000 --> 0:04:03,000
 It's so cool.

77
0:04:03,000 --> 0:04:05,000
 And then we had...

78
0:04:05,000 --> 0:04:08,000
 We had a couple of people setting up the...

79
0:04:08,000 --> 0:04:09,000
 Setting up switches and...

80
0:04:09,000 --> 0:04:10,000
 What's it called?

81
0:04:10,000 --> 0:04:12,000
 The turtles, we call them.

82
0:04:12,000 --> 0:04:13,000
 The outside access point...

83
0:04:13,000 --> 0:04:14,000
 Not access points.

84
0:04:14,000 --> 0:04:15,000
 Points of presence.

85
0:04:15,000 --> 0:04:18,000
 And then we have the people sitting down,

86
0:04:18,000 --> 0:04:23,000
 sitting comfortably in their tents or in the bar or wherever they sit comfortably,

87
0:04:23,000 --> 0:04:26,000
 and doing the server and the configuration.

88
0:04:26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
 And then there was also me.

89
0:04:28,000 --> 0:04:30,000
 I was, you know...

90
0:04:30,000 --> 0:04:31,000
 I'm here today.

91
0:04:31,000 --> 0:04:33,000
 This is what I do at BornHack.

92
0:04:33,000 --> 0:04:34,000
 I just...

93
0:04:34,000 --> 0:04:37,000
 I just say all the nice things and show you all the cool graphs.

94
0:04:37,000 --> 0:04:40,000
 And basically, it's everybody else doing all the work.

95
0:04:40,000 --> 0:04:43,000
 And I think you guys have done a kick-ass job this year.

96
0:04:43,000 --> 0:04:46,000
 And I really want to hear a loud applaud for the network team.

97
0:04:48,000 --> 0:04:54,000
 You guys have done a good job.

98
0:04:54,000 --> 0:04:56,000
 Here we go.

99
0:04:56,000 --> 0:04:57,000
 Thank you, guys.

100
0:04:57,000 --> 0:04:58,000
 Thank you.

101
0:04:58,000 --> 0:04:59,000
 Thank you, guys.

102
0:04:59,000 --> 0:05:00,000
 Okay.

103
0:05:00,000 --> 0:05:02,000
 So this talk is going to be structured completely like last year where we start with all the

104
0:05:02,000 --> 0:05:03,000
 core stuff.

105
0:05:03,000 --> 0:05:10,000
 And so, what I did is that I think, you know, when we arrive on camp, we have no internet

106
0:05:10,000 --> 0:05:11,000
 and all that.

107
0:05:11,000 --> 0:05:16,000
 And we need to spend some time getting the uplink up and running and yada, yada, yada.

108
0:05:16,000 --> 0:05:17,000
 So, I brought my 4G modem.

109
0:05:17,000 --> 0:05:23,860
 modem and hook the server up, and this is the numbers I got, 12 megabit up and one and

110
0:05:23,860 --> 0:05:29,700
 a half megabit down, oh sorry, the other way around, and that's okay for installing, you

111
0:05:29,700 --> 0:05:35,060
 know, a server or two or something, but we're so not going to run the entire camp on this.

112
0:05:35,060 --> 0:05:39,380
 But it is one of these things we have so that we actually have internet connection for the

113
0:05:39,380 --> 0:05:43,580
 server, so we can install the virtual machines, while people are in the field pulling cables

114
0:05:43,580 --> 0:05:47,700
 and such, we can do our server stuff also, and that was very, very cool, and I think

115
0:05:47,700 --> 0:05:49,400
 that was a good idea, and I'm going to do it again next year.

116
0:05:49,980 --> 0:05:54,800
 And it was very nice, but, oh, yeah, I forgot this one, leave it.

117
0:05:56,420 --> 0:06:03,340
 But the thing that happened was that we actually had first light on Sunday at four past one,

118
0:06:03,520 --> 0:06:08,640
 which is two hours earlier or three hours earlier than we did last year.

119
0:06:09,140 --> 0:06:13,380
 So we are kind of competing with ourselves on how fast we can get first light, so we

120
0:06:13,380 --> 0:06:13,540
 know.

121
0:06:13,580 --> 0:06:19,920
 We know that everything is working, and that is nice, and the thing was that at that time,

122
0:06:20,020 --> 0:06:23,100
 we kind of, we have this MX connector issue.

123
0:06:23,320 --> 0:06:25,780
 If you're regular, you have heard of MX connectors.

124
0:06:26,480 --> 0:06:27,900
 We all know what it is now.

125
0:06:27,900 --> 0:06:34,440
 It's wonderful for, I don't know, not us, but the thing is that these connectors, we

126
0:06:34,440 --> 0:06:38,560
 actually bought a MX to LC connector, and we had that.

127
0:06:39,060 --> 0:06:39,840
 That was last year.

128
0:06:39,960 --> 0:06:43,400
 It was super nice, except it was a flange coupling.

129
0:06:43,580 --> 0:06:46,100
 Flange coupling, which kind of, you know, clunk, clunk.

130
0:06:47,580 --> 0:06:53,340
 So we needed to get an extra cable, and luckily, people save phone numbers for technicians

131
0:06:53,340 --> 0:06:58,420
 in their phone book, so we basically called the same technician as last year and asked

132
0:06:58,420 --> 0:07:03,680
 if we could borrow the same cable as last year, and that arrived later in the afternoon.

133
0:07:04,300 --> 0:07:05,040
 And that's fine.

134
0:07:05,200 --> 0:07:09,540
 So this first light we have here is, you know, fibers is something with light, right?

135
0:07:09,820 --> 0:07:12,540
 So if you just align two fibers correctly...

136
0:07:13,580 --> 0:07:16,000
 And use a lot of duct tape, it works!

137
0:07:22,840 --> 0:07:23,280
 Yes.

138
0:07:23,540 --> 0:07:29,280
 And I think it's very cool, and apparently, Rudy was very happy with the attenuation and

139
0:07:29,280 --> 0:07:35,460
 such, but we kind of decided not to, you know, we kind of fixed it with the proper cable

140
0:07:35,460 --> 0:07:38,380
 later when it arrived, because, you know, that's how we work.

141
0:07:39,140 --> 0:07:42,820
 But this thing about...

142
0:07:42,820 --> 0:07:46,600
 So we got first light at 1 o'clock in the afternoon on Sunday.

143
0:07:46,920 --> 0:07:51,880
 It actually turned out that we had internet at 1 o'clock on Sunday.

144
0:07:52,480 --> 0:07:57,520
 So I think that's a massive record compared to what we had done before.

145
0:07:58,040 --> 0:08:01,760
 So basically, we had internet access in the middle of Sunday, so all my hard work with

146
0:08:01,760 --> 0:08:06,220
 setting up a 4G modem, you know, my work, kind of not that applicable.

147
0:08:06,640 --> 0:08:08,040
 But anyway, we're going to bring it next year anyway.

148
0:08:08,260 --> 0:08:12,620
 But it appears that Global Connect has just left the circuit open for us.

149
0:08:12,820 --> 0:08:17,100
 But the connections, not connections, what's called configuration, BGP, and such, they

150
0:08:17,100 --> 0:08:19,000
 were configured correctly, and they just worked.

151
0:08:19,660 --> 0:08:20,580
 And that's very cool.

152
0:08:20,720 --> 0:08:23,220
 So we have had the internet for a very long time on this camp.

153
0:08:27,700 --> 0:08:32,720
 And then we, of course, have, just to go through the equipment we have and such, we have R31,

154
0:08:33,040 --> 0:08:34,160
 which is our server room.

155
0:08:35,400 --> 0:08:39,820
 I still think it's super fun to call it R31, because that was the first year we're here,

156
0:08:39,880 --> 0:08:41,380
 we're using a grid system, right?

157
0:08:41,720 --> 0:08:42,220
 And that was R31.

158
0:08:42,820 --> 0:08:46,660
 R31, which was the toilet building with a built-in server room.

159
0:08:48,460 --> 0:08:52,140
 And I like our way of doing physical security.

160
0:08:53,120 --> 0:08:58,580
 One of the days on camp, I kind of couldn't find anyone and, you know, needed a cable.

161
0:08:59,140 --> 0:09:03,300
 So I can just, I'm not that small, right?

162
0:09:04,120 --> 0:09:07,600
 But I could just easily fit through the door even though it was locked.

163
0:09:09,500 --> 0:09:11,340
 Physical security, we love it.

164
0:09:11,340 --> 0:09:12,640
 It might be applicable.

165
0:09:12,820 --> 0:09:16,140
 It might be applicable somewhere, but, yeah, we, it's kind of just, we put in a chain to

166
0:09:16,140 --> 0:09:17,200
 tell people, don't go here.

167
0:09:17,880 --> 0:09:21,060
 I'm pretty sure that some of you will be able to find a way in anyway.

168
0:09:22,500 --> 0:09:28,480
 But as always, we have, it's actually a nice room we have there in R31 where we keep the

169
0:09:28,480 --> 0:09:31,100
 door open because we actually have a lot of the computer equipment in there.

170
0:09:31,500 --> 0:09:33,680
 And as you can see in the picture, we have a lot of crap.

171
0:09:33,680 --> 0:09:41,220
 We have a server, a couple of servers, actually, and switches, and the thing on the floor would

172
0:09:41,220 --> 0:09:42,640
 be a large MX.

173
0:09:42,820 --> 0:09:47,520
 We also got some UPSs, which we kind of did not get to installing.

174
0:09:47,520 --> 0:09:50,660
 Might be something we need to look into.

175
0:09:50,660 --> 0:09:55,580
 But basically, this looks like it did last year, except we have more fiber this year.

176
0:09:55,580 --> 0:09:57,580
 Okay.

177
0:09:57,580 --> 0:10:01,080
 One of the things we got that was new is we got a new MX.

178
0:10:01,080 --> 0:10:03,560
 That's a Juniper routing device.

179
0:10:03,560 --> 0:10:10,740
 This is, as you can see, this is the thing, it's, don't carry it alone, you know?

180
0:10:10,740 --> 0:10:12,780
 And this is a very big routing.

181
0:10:12,780 --> 0:10:13,780
 And this is a box.

182
0:10:13,780 --> 0:10:17,920
 And what we have done this year is that we, of course, have a lot of 10-gig things going

183
0:10:17,920 --> 0:10:20,280
 on, and this one can just handle it.

184
0:10:20,280 --> 0:10:23,340
 And that's very cool, so we like this one.

185
0:10:23,340 --> 0:10:28,920
 And this is something that Rudi has gotten his hand on and got some parts from Falco

186
0:10:28,920 --> 0:10:33,780
 Networks, so that's very nice to, you know, know people who want to contribute and help

187
0:10:33,780 --> 0:10:34,780
 us.

188
0:10:34,780 --> 0:10:35,780
 Should we give them a hand?

189
0:10:42,780 --> 0:10:43,780
 Okay.

190
0:10:43,780 --> 0:10:51,040
 There's another thing that we got this year, because most of, when you, as the user of

191
0:10:51,040 --> 0:10:57,160
 this network, you, most of you have seen close to zero difference between this year and last

192
0:10:57,160 --> 0:10:58,160
 year.

193
0:10:58,160 --> 0:11:02,780
 But we have had, I would call it, a massive upgrade of our core infrastructure.

194
0:11:02,780 --> 0:11:08,080
 So one of the things that happened was that we got some QFXs.

195
0:11:08,080 --> 0:11:10,780
 Just like the MXs are big-ass routing box.

196
0:11:10,780 --> 0:11:11,780
 Okay.

197
0:11:11,780 --> 0:11:12,780
 Cool.

198
0:11:12,780 --> 0:11:15,840
 And then the QFXs are fiber switches.

199
0:11:15,840 --> 0:11:22,440
 And so last year, people were saying, oh, we want 10-gigs in the tents.

200
0:11:22,440 --> 0:11:28,700
 And I was thinking, yeah, about that, because the switches we use kind of don't have that

201
0:11:28,700 --> 0:11:30,380
 many 10-gig ports.

202
0:11:30,380 --> 0:11:35,040
 I was just counting all the people saying they wanted 10-gig and thinking this might

203
0:11:35,040 --> 0:11:36,780
 become an issue.

204
0:11:36,780 --> 0:11:41,780
 But then Juni Palase called from Roskilde Festival and said, we have two QFXs in spare.

205
0:11:41,780 --> 0:11:42,780
 Okay.

206
0:11:42,780 --> 0:11:43,780
 Do you want them?

207
0:11:43,780 --> 0:11:44,780
 Yes.

208
0:11:44,780 --> 0:11:45,780
 Thank you.

209
0:11:45,780 --> 0:11:50,780
 Yeah, we need to pick them up before we do inventory.

210
0:11:50,780 --> 0:11:55,560
 I don't ask why that was the case, but fine.

211
0:11:55,560 --> 0:11:56,880
 So we got that organized.

212
0:11:56,880 --> 0:12:02,400
 And I think this solved the issue I had with the 10-gig, number of 10-gig uplinks.

213
0:12:02,400 --> 0:12:07,780
 So should we give them a hand also?

214
0:12:07,780 --> 0:12:09,780
 Okay.

215
0:12:09,780 --> 0:12:10,780
 Cool.

216
0:12:10,780 --> 0:12:11,780
 Cool.

217
0:12:11,780 --> 0:12:12,780
 Thank you.

218
0:12:12,780 --> 0:12:15,640
 It is actually some interesting equipment.

219
0:12:15,640 --> 0:12:18,320
 I'm wondering how we're going to use it.

220
0:12:18,320 --> 0:12:23,080
 But you see, this is massive amounts.

221
0:12:23,080 --> 0:12:28,780
 It's that 48 ports for SPFs and SFPs.

222
0:12:28,780 --> 0:12:29,780
 SFPs.

223
0:12:29,780 --> 0:12:30,780
 SFP+.

224
0:12:30,780 --> 0:12:31,780
 Yes.

225
0:12:31,780 --> 0:12:32,780
 That's all mighty nice.

226
0:12:32,780 --> 0:12:35,540
 They can do 10-gig or perhaps 20, I don't know.

227
0:12:35,540 --> 0:12:38,780
 And this one over here are 40-gig optics ports.

228
0:12:38,780 --> 0:12:39,780
 Yeah.

229
0:12:39,780 --> 0:12:40,780
 Okay.

230
0:12:40,780 --> 0:12:41,780
 Fine.

231
0:12:41,780 --> 0:12:46,780
 I think they might suit our need for, you know, a year or so, I don't know.

232
0:12:46,780 --> 0:12:51,320
 If we compare the amount of bandwidth we used this year to last year, we are actually probably

233
0:12:51,320 --> 0:12:54,280
 going to have an issue next year also.

234
0:12:54,280 --> 0:13:00,780
 Anyway, this is very cool equipment.

235
0:13:00,780 --> 0:13:04,580
 So let's do this one again.

236
0:13:04,580 --> 0:13:09,740
 So what we did was that we actually put in one of these QFXs in the Labitat tent in order

237
0:13:09,740 --> 0:13:15,500
 to have, we had two QFXs and it was not enough to have it in the tent, in the R31.

238
0:13:15,500 --> 0:13:16,600
 So we needed somewhere to put it.

239
0:13:16,600 --> 0:13:20,740
 So we put it in the Labitat tent in order for, to give access to these ports to more

240
0:13:20,740 --> 0:13:21,740
 people.

241
0:13:21,740 --> 0:13:27,640
 And apparently Labitat, they, I think they at least have hooked up two things to that

242
0:13:27,640 --> 0:13:28,640
 one.

243
0:13:28,640 --> 0:13:32,740
 So I wonder what they are doing with 10-gig uplink.

244
0:13:32,740 --> 0:13:35,180
 Okay.

245
0:13:35,180 --> 0:13:36,340
 So fibers.

246
0:13:36,340 --> 0:13:39,740
 This layout is very close to what we did last year.

247
0:13:39,740 --> 0:13:47,740
 Except that the, we had torque down here last time, but this one moved up here.

248
0:13:47,740 --> 0:13:56,740
 So the, well, the distribution point was the camp last time, general camping, sorry.

249
0:13:56,740 --> 0:13:58,740
 And this year it was the torque tent.

250
0:13:58,740 --> 0:14:01,740
 And that just, it was basically the same for us.

251
0:14:01,740 --> 0:14:07,740
 There are some things about torque tent about bandwidth and such, so they should have their

252
0:14:07,740 --> 0:14:08,740
 own fiber content.

253
0:14:08,740 --> 0:14:09,740
 Okay.

254
0:14:09,740 --> 0:14:10,740
 So that's the power connection.

255
0:14:10,740 --> 0:14:16,400
 But since we, as I mentioned, have insane amounts of fiber ports available, all of these

256
0:14:16,400 --> 0:14:26,080
 pops and a couple of people down here, they have their own fiber directly going to R31.

257
0:14:26,080 --> 0:14:30,880
 You know, because we of course not doing overkill here.

258
0:14:30,880 --> 0:14:36,740
 But it's interesting that this give us this start topology that we have been discussing.

259
0:14:36,740 --> 0:14:38,740
 And so it means that.

260
0:14:38,740 --> 0:14:44,740
 If we lose power somewhere along the way, it doesn't affect the rest of the network.

261
0:14:44,740 --> 0:14:54,640
 So if the pop at general camping dies, silent would still be functioning.

262
0:14:54,640 --> 0:14:59,700
 Because it's just a passive connection going through, you know, this light thing with.

263
0:14:59,700 --> 0:15:02,040
 And that's a really nice design.

264
0:15:02,040 --> 0:15:04,740
 Of course provided that we don't break any cables.

265
0:15:04,740 --> 0:15:07,740
 This is something that I'm getting more and more on my list.

266
0:15:07,740 --> 0:15:16,740
 Because we've had zero cable related incidents in as long as I know, past years and years.

267
0:15:16,740 --> 0:15:17,740
 It's just.

268
0:15:17,740 --> 0:15:25,740
 So are we lucky or is fiber is just that robust or this is my favorite.

269
0:15:25,740 --> 0:15:31,740
 I think we have super nice people showing up at bone hack that likes this and take care of our equipment.

270
0:15:31,740 --> 0:15:33,740
 I think that is super cool.

271
0:15:33,740 --> 0:15:36,740
 And I think you should give yourself a round of applause for being so nice to our equipment.

272
0:15:37,740 --> 0:15:52,740
 So I just pulled the stats and we have rolled out two point seven kilometers of fiber.

273
0:15:52,740 --> 0:15:55,740
 Actually, that is the fiber that we've used.

274
0:15:55,740 --> 0:16:02,740
 And it is from the two dimensional up of you, which is the number I can get from my program.

275
0:16:02,740 --> 0:16:05,740
 We are doing one point seven kilometers.

276
0:16:05,740 --> 0:16:11,740
 But again, if they're in regulars, the first year was here, we had this hashtag called too short.

277
0:16:11,740 --> 0:16:17,740
 And that's because me looking at the maps, I'm always looking, you know, two dimensional and around here.

278
0:16:17,740 --> 0:16:19,740
 The ground actually looks like this.

279
0:16:19,740 --> 0:16:25,740
 So all my planning about which cables and fibers we needed for the first year was just so off that we kind of ditched it.

280
0:16:25,740 --> 0:16:29,740
 And so this one point seven kilometers is not true.

281
0:16:29,740 --> 0:16:31,740
 It is way more than that.

282
0:16:31,740 --> 0:16:34,740
 But the cable length combined would be two point seven.

283
0:16:34,740 --> 0:16:36,740
 So that's nice.

284
0:16:36,740 --> 0:16:39,740
 And it's good with some exercise when you go for a walk.

285
0:16:39,740 --> 0:16:46,740
 And this is, of course, not including all the access points because, yeah, you need to walk a lot for that.

286
0:16:46,740 --> 0:16:48,740
 Anyway, lots of fibers.

287
0:16:48,740 --> 0:16:49,740
 We like fibers.

288
0:16:49,740 --> 0:16:52,740
 We do star topology.

289
0:16:52,740 --> 0:16:55,740
 I'm a, what's it called?

290
0:16:55,740 --> 0:16:57,740
 I'm a ring guy myself.

291
0:16:57,740 --> 0:17:04,740
 But I kind of was convinced or vetoed or whatever it was that we are doing star topology.

292
0:17:04,740 --> 0:17:06,740
 That's fine.

293
0:17:06,740 --> 0:17:08,740
 You know, I'm just here to look pretty.

294
0:17:08,740 --> 0:17:15,740
 And if they say, Morten, you're going to look pretty if we do star topology, I'm going to say, okay, fine.

295
0:17:15,740 --> 0:17:16,740
 Okay.

296
0:17:16,740 --> 0:17:19,740
 This is an abbreviation that we all know.

297
0:17:19,740 --> 0:17:26,740
 It means fiber to the tent.

298
0:17:26,740 --> 0:17:31,740
 And so we had, of course, we had this pixel flood and so on.

299
0:17:31,740 --> 0:17:32,740
 And just.

300
0:17:32,740 --> 0:17:44,740
 We are in a position where we have a core infrastructure that is big enough to allow us to give whoever wanted it basically 10 gigs to their tents.

301
0:17:44,740 --> 0:17:49,740
 Not that most people will actually, you know, kind of maybe need it.

302
0:17:49,740 --> 0:17:53,740
 But, hey, I'm lying here in my tent on my 10 gig connection.

303
0:17:53,740 --> 0:17:57,740
 That's apparently something people like to say to people when they're on Twitter or whatever.

304
0:17:57,740 --> 0:17:58,740
 That's fine.

305
0:17:58,740 --> 0:17:59,740
 That's fine.

306
0:17:59,740 --> 0:18:00,740
 Let's do that.

307
0:18:00,740 --> 0:18:01,740
 And I think it's cool also.

308
0:18:01,740 --> 0:18:09,740
 It also means that when we have a camp like pajamas or something that likes to experiment with weird shit, they can just get a 10 gig fiber.

309
0:18:09,740 --> 0:18:15,740
 And the thing we could do this year was that it was a passive 10 gig fiber directly to R31.

310
0:18:15,740 --> 0:18:19,740
 So it means that if they screwed up, not touching that.

311
0:18:19,740 --> 0:18:20,740
 And that's fine.

312
0:18:20,740 --> 0:18:23,740
 Especially if they screw up with power.

313
0:18:23,740 --> 0:18:29,740
 If they screw up with other things, which we might see in a couple of slides, it might affect everybody.

314
0:18:29,740 --> 0:18:30,740
 It's an interesting thing.

315
0:18:30,740 --> 0:18:36,740
 It's an interesting thing to give so many people so much bandwidth.

316
0:18:36,740 --> 0:18:40,740
 Because we at the NOC team, we just say, yeah, you're nice people.

317
0:18:40,740 --> 0:18:43,740
 We're, of course, not going to get any issues when you give people 10 gig.

318
0:18:43,740 --> 0:18:48,740
 Of course we're not because you behave, right?

319
0:18:48,740 --> 0:18:54,740
 But it also is so we have this structure where we have the fibers with the Q of X that talks to the MX.

320
0:18:54,740 --> 0:18:58,740
 And to get it up and running, we have set in one 10 gig connection.

321
0:18:58,740 --> 0:19:05,740
 And when you look at such a fiber switch and you see, oh, there's 10-ish, 10 gig fiber connection coming in,

322
0:19:05,740 --> 0:19:12,740
 perhaps a 10 gig connection between the switch to the router might be just a tad optimistic.

323
0:19:12,740 --> 0:19:16,740
 So we are doing, I think we end up in dual 10 gig between these two.

324
0:19:16,740 --> 0:19:21,740
 And I'm pretty sure we want more next year because now you know we have it.

325
0:19:21,740 --> 0:19:26,740
 And apparently people have stuff that uses it.

326
0:19:26,740 --> 0:19:33,740
 We're also routing Pixel Flute, which is, well, why not-ish.

327
0:19:33,740 --> 0:19:36,740
 Okay.

328
0:19:36,740 --> 0:19:43,740
 As always, we have got a huge pile of stuff from EventInfo.

329
0:19:43,740 --> 0:19:52,740
 It has been an interesting thing this year, I think, for Rudy because all this equipment we have, it was used on MCH.

330
0:19:52,740 --> 0:19:55,740
 So when they were packing MCH, Rudy was there saying,

331
0:19:55,740 --> 0:19:59,740
 I want that one, I want that one, I want that one.

332
0:19:59,740 --> 0:20:04,740
 And then suddenly we have insane amounts of cable and fibers and switches and, you know,

333
0:20:04,740 --> 0:20:06,740
 all the usual stuff we get from EventInfo.

334
0:20:06,740 --> 0:20:09,740
 And that is very cool that we have this option.

335
0:20:09,740 --> 0:20:11,740
 So thank you to EventInfo.

336
0:20:19,740 --> 0:20:20,740
 Yes.

337
0:20:20,740 --> 0:20:24,740
 So when I look at our network and I look at our uplink fiber,

338
0:20:24,740 --> 0:20:31,740
 it's 666 meters of well-armored fiber.

339
0:20:31,740 --> 0:20:34,740
 And it's just, why would I go get that?

340
0:20:34,740 --> 0:20:36,740
 It's not something you go buy.

341
0:20:36,740 --> 0:20:40,740
 We can get that from EventInfo and if we don't get it for some reason,

342
0:20:40,740 --> 0:20:45,740
 then suddenly I have to, you know, earn my pay and figure out where to get shit.

343
0:20:45,740 --> 0:20:47,740
 So let's hope we can keep getting that.

344
0:20:47,740 --> 0:20:48,740
 We like EventInfo.

345
0:20:48,740 --> 0:20:51,740
 They're also the ones with the torches and stuff.

346
0:20:51,740 --> 0:20:52,740
 Okay.

347
0:20:52,740 --> 0:20:53,740
 What else do we have?

348
0:20:53,740 --> 0:20:54,740
 Non-core stuff.

349
0:20:54,740 --> 0:20:57,740
 We have installed 32 access points.

350
0:20:57,740 --> 0:21:00,740
 And that is nice.

351
0:21:00,740 --> 0:21:05,740
 We had the access point guys walking around camp setting stuff up left and right.

352
0:21:05,740 --> 0:21:09,740
 And as always, I don't know if the last one was set up two days ago, but it's not.

353
0:21:09,740 --> 0:21:14,740
 When you set up an access point in a place like this, we have an idea where to set them up.

354
0:21:14,740 --> 0:21:16,740
 And then suddenly reality hits.

355
0:21:16,740 --> 0:21:21,740
 There's suddenly a lot of people there or bad coverage there due to I don't know what.

356
0:21:21,740 --> 0:21:27,740
 So we will update where the access points are located during camp.

357
0:21:27,740 --> 0:21:32,740
 Actually, we just add extra ones because we kind of have a lot this year.

358
0:21:32,740 --> 0:21:37,740
 And then when I was, you know, I'm doing statistics and all these things,

359
0:21:37,740 --> 0:21:40,740
 and I'm just looking at these 32 access points.

360
0:21:40,740 --> 0:21:43,740
 This is the names of the access points.

361
0:21:47,740 --> 0:21:51,740
 I think that it's on my list for next year that we should have a naming convention.

362
0:21:51,740 --> 0:21:53,740
 For access points.

363
0:21:53,740 --> 0:21:58,740
 So that we kind of know that access point whatever is residing over there and so on.

364
0:21:58,740 --> 0:22:01,740
 Right now, it's just, yeah.

365
0:22:01,740 --> 0:22:06,740
 Let's hope we can get where it is.

366
0:22:06,740 --> 0:22:09,740
 Yes.

367
0:22:09,740 --> 0:22:12,740
 We also, one of the reasons that we have access points.

368
0:22:12,740 --> 0:22:16,740
 Well, first of all, we brought something like 30 from EventInfo.

369
0:22:16,740 --> 0:22:20,740
 But SignOut, he found 20 Aruba access points.

370
0:22:20,740 --> 0:22:24,740
 In the which is, you know, used.

371
0:22:24,740 --> 0:22:28,740
 And it's just, so, do you want that?

372
0:22:28,740 --> 0:22:30,740
 Yeah.

373
0:22:30,740 --> 0:22:33,740
 So we suddenly got 20 extra Aruba access points.

374
0:22:33,740 --> 0:22:39,740
 So besides the 30 that Rudy brought, we are suddenly at 50.

375
0:22:39,740 --> 0:22:44,740
 I think that's way enough, I'm trying to say.

376
0:22:44,740 --> 0:22:47,740
 So thank you to SignOut for organizing this.

377
0:22:47,740 --> 0:22:48,740
 This is very nice.

378
0:22:48,740 --> 0:22:49,740
 Thanks.

379
0:22:50,740 --> 0:22:51,740
 Thank you.

380
0:22:51,740 --> 0:23:03,740
 And, as always, we have Ikdot, who is somewhere in the back.

381
0:23:03,740 --> 0:23:05,740
 Setting up home lights.

382
0:23:05,740 --> 0:23:06,740
 I like home lights.

383
0:23:06,740 --> 0:23:07,740
 It's just, it's way cool.

384
0:23:07,740 --> 0:23:15,740
 And for some reason, we're using publicly accessible Internet accessible IP address

385
0:23:15,740 --> 0:23:18,740
 for the controller of the home lights.

386
0:23:18,740 --> 0:23:19,740
 What can go wrong?

387
0:23:19,740 --> 0:23:30,400
 I think that's interesting in so many ways, but the point is that this is equipment that shows us the switches of work and they give a good atmosphere to the field and such.

388
0:23:30,500 --> 0:23:34,720
 I think it's just, we want that and we want more, more of these.

389
0:23:35,420 --> 0:23:36,160
 Thank you, 8Dot.

390
0:23:43,380 --> 0:23:48,280
 And this is, oh, there's just some random things happening when you're at Bonehack.

391
0:23:48,280 --> 0:23:52,260
 So, on the POC channel for the, what's POC?

392
0:23:52,400 --> 0:23:54,600
 That would be phone operation center.

393
0:23:55,320 --> 0:23:57,300
 Anyway, the one that also do decked phones.

394
0:23:58,280 --> 0:24:06,600
 There was a question, I think it was Rudy who asked it, if we should get a 4G connection or an LTE network on CAMP.

395
0:24:06,920 --> 0:24:08,760
 And I think that's a super nice idea.

396
0:24:09,320 --> 0:24:16,820
 So, as I was walking over there somewhere, some random dude asked, do you have a GPS antenna for an NTP server?

397
0:24:18,280 --> 0:24:18,520
 What?

398
0:24:20,180 --> 0:24:21,380
 And of course I do.

399
0:24:23,280 --> 0:24:25,920
 So, it's one of my pet projects that I have in my box.

400
0:24:26,200 --> 0:24:32,300
 So, it turned out that apparently you need a super precise NTP system in order to have LTE working.

401
0:24:33,420 --> 0:24:37,980
 And so, we have LTE working in that part of the CAMP over there.

402
0:24:38,060 --> 0:24:39,120
 I have no idea how it works.

403
0:24:39,580 --> 0:24:44,880
 But it basically, to me, it's a proof of concept that maybe next year we want LTE all over the place.

404
0:24:45,740 --> 0:24:48,240
 Am I getting eye contact with anyone who is nodding?

405
0:24:48,340 --> 0:24:48,900
 Okay, fine.

406
0:24:50,300 --> 0:24:53,460
 No, it's one of these things I've been looking at these decked phones and I'm thinking,

407
0:24:53,760 --> 0:24:59,680
 it's much easier for me to find a good normal mobile phone than it is for me to find a good decked phone.

408
0:25:00,360 --> 0:25:02,260
 And if it's all local, that could be really nice.

409
0:25:03,640 --> 0:25:12,180
 So, and of course I took a picture of the LTE device because isn't it obviously an LTE antenna we have there?

410
0:25:14,180 --> 0:25:15,340
 Hmm, yeah.

411
0:25:15,840 --> 0:25:18,180
 I think less proficient people...

412
0:25:18,280 --> 0:25:25,960
 I think people might just see it as a white box and not just as not an LTE thing, but yeah, but we're pros here, right?

413
0:25:27,660 --> 0:25:28,500
 But it's very interesting.

414
0:25:28,500 --> 0:25:38,240
 It's a, so this Raspberry Pi just has a shield on it and then you can hook in the GPS thing and then some software can do extremely precise clocks for this.

415
0:25:38,660 --> 0:25:39,160
 Very nice.

416
0:25:41,080 --> 0:25:41,580
 Okay.

417
0:25:42,540 --> 0:25:46,880
 And then we have a little thing that I found to be super interesting.

418
0:25:46,880 --> 0:25:47,380
 That was...

419
0:25:48,280 --> 0:25:52,820
 Again, a sign out. He had heard our call about use more bandwidth.

420
0:25:53,560 --> 0:25:57,660
 So he basically brought his Synology box and hooked up...

421
0:25:58,360 --> 0:26:03,200
 hooked it up to the network and that is the thing that is doing this 250...

422
0:26:03,880 --> 0:26:09,080
 250, 300 megabit upload steady state in the past week.

423
0:26:09,500 --> 0:26:16,100
 So this box is using more bandwidth than we did last year, all of us.

424
0:26:18,280 --> 0:26:19,100
 I think...

425
0:26:19,760 --> 0:26:20,700
 Nice going, sign out.

426
0:26:26,400 --> 0:26:27,740
 Yes, I think that is super cool.

427
0:26:27,740 --> 0:26:28,240
 It's just...

428
0:26:28,840 --> 0:26:29,740
 And, and it's simple.

429
0:26:30,840 --> 0:26:31,520
 Yeah, no mind.

430
0:26:31,980 --> 0:26:32,920
 Okay, what else do we have?

431
0:26:33,420 --> 0:26:37,560
 Yes, as always I have my own way of spelling Pixiflute because...

432
0:26:39,300 --> 0:26:39,900
 I don't know.

433
0:26:39,900 --> 0:26:41,020
 It's just a weird word.

434
0:26:42,300 --> 0:26:48,120
 So, when I was doing this slide because we have Pixiflute and actually there was a mention of this in the...

435
0:26:48,120 --> 0:26:59,680
 in the talk by the game team and there are some really nice things that happened this year that we could actually see the talks from the stream.

436
0:26:59,680 --> 0:27:04,620
 It got piped into Pixiflute full screen.

437
0:27:04,620 --> 0:27:07,880
 I'm thinking, someone is probably using bandwidth for that.

438
0:27:08,880 --> 0:27:13,600
 As you can see, this is something that it's taking a while.

439
0:27:13,600 --> 0:27:16,640
 It's a picture I took while there was Hacker Jeopardy.

440
0:27:16,640 --> 0:27:17,140
 And then...

441
0:27:17,140 --> 0:27:17,640
 And then...

442
0:27:17,640 --> 0:27:26,200
 And then, of course, because it's Pixiflute, we have this apparently background thingy and then another person wanted to put in a picture of a tent and...

443
0:27:27,420 --> 0:27:27,920
 What's that?

444
0:27:29,800 --> 0:27:30,300
 I don't know.

445
0:27:31,300 --> 0:27:35,720
 Okay, but it's moving over the screen and it's pretty or something.

446
0:27:36,720 --> 0:27:41,320
 But that's Pixiflute for you and, of course, the mandatory NEM ID login screen.

447
0:27:43,360 --> 0:27:43,860
 I just...

448
0:27:43,860 --> 0:27:44,360
 Yeah, fine.

449
0:27:45,320 --> 0:27:46,660
 So, Pixiflute.

450
0:27:46,660 --> 0:27:48,040
 It's apparently a thing.

451
0:27:48,240 --> 0:27:48,520
 That's fine.

452
0:27:48,900 --> 0:27:50,420
 So, what I did when I wanted to...

453
0:27:50,420 --> 0:27:52,780
 Let's get some, what's it called, metrics for this.

454
0:27:53,260 --> 0:27:54,400
 So, I went to the...

455
0:27:54,400 --> 0:27:56,300
 It's a brocade switch that's up there in the bar.

456
0:27:56,860 --> 0:27:59,940
 And I found that it was using...

457
0:27:59,940 --> 0:28:01,200
 So, this is inverted.

458
0:28:02,800 --> 0:28:06,060
 So, here you have that it's using a steady state.

459
0:28:06,980 --> 0:28:11,620
 It's receiving these 7.4 gigabits, right?

460
0:28:12,340 --> 0:28:13,840
 And that was the first...

461
0:28:13,840 --> 0:28:15,540
 So, when I made these slides, I found that one.

462
0:28:15,540 --> 0:28:15,780
 And I thought...

463
0:28:15,780 --> 0:28:15,800
 I found that one.

464
0:28:15,800 --> 0:28:15,860
 I found that one.

465
0:28:15,860 --> 0:28:15,900
 I found that one.

466
0:28:15,900 --> 0:28:15,960
 I found that one.

467
0:28:16,200 --> 0:28:16,640
 7.4 gigabits.

468
0:28:16,660 --> 0:28:17,020
 7.4?

469
0:28:17,240 --> 0:28:17,920
 Yeah, okay.

470
0:28:18,900 --> 0:28:19,340
 Fine.

471
0:28:19,600 --> 0:28:23,160
 But it looked like more, but, you know, 7.4, it's fine.

472
0:28:23,820 --> 0:28:25,660
 And then there was this talk by the game people.

473
0:28:26,240 --> 0:28:28,080
 And they said, 25 gigs.

474
0:28:28,180 --> 0:28:31,160
 And I said, yeah, I probably need to go check my graphs again then.

475
0:28:31,700 --> 0:28:35,660
 And it was just silly me because I just found this one.

476
0:28:36,220 --> 0:28:38,320
 This is a 40 gig interface.

477
0:28:38,780 --> 0:28:43,080
 And I thought that they only used one 40 gig interface for Pixiflute.

478
0:28:44,180 --> 0:28:46,200
 It's just apparently you use...

479
0:28:46,200 --> 0:28:50,440
 You use dual 40 gig for Pixiflute because...

480
0:28:50,440 --> 0:28:50,760
 Yeah, okay.

481
0:28:51,320 --> 0:28:52,380
 That surprised me.

482
0:28:52,480 --> 0:28:53,480
 I know this for next time.

483
0:28:54,360 --> 0:28:54,880
 That was funny.

484
0:28:55,120 --> 0:28:57,100
 It was just dual 40 gig.

485
0:28:58,100 --> 0:28:58,500
 Yeah.

486
0:28:58,720 --> 0:29:01,380
 As I said, we have access to a certain amount of bandwidth.

487
0:29:01,660 --> 0:29:03,400
 And that is apparently being used a lot.

488
0:29:03,500 --> 0:29:04,020
 That's very cool.

489
0:29:04,880 --> 0:29:05,080
 Okay.

490
0:29:05,400 --> 0:29:15,000
 So, you might remember last year where Kramse had a very successful denial of service workshop.

491
0:29:16,200 --> 0:29:19,180
 It was a very cool thing that kind of took down the entire network.

492
0:29:20,000 --> 0:29:21,420
 And that was...

493
0:29:21,420 --> 0:29:22,240
 Yeah, yeah.

494
0:29:22,460 --> 0:29:24,060
 We decided not to do that this year.

495
0:29:25,560 --> 0:29:30,100
 So, how can we take down the network if we are not using a denial of service workshop?

496
0:29:31,120 --> 0:29:32,280
 I'm looking at you, Labitat.

497
0:29:34,000 --> 0:29:41,500
 So, one thing you could do is to, you know, multicast video all over the place.

498
0:29:42,760 --> 0:29:44,860
 And it's just, yeah, yeah, yeah.

499
0:29:44,860 --> 0:29:46,920
 Multicast is evil.

500
0:29:47,920 --> 0:29:49,500
 So, it broke a lot of things.

501
0:29:49,760 --> 0:29:51,680
 And some people called someone.

502
0:29:51,840 --> 0:29:55,340
 And then it suddenly stopped when some people had a chat with someone.

503
0:29:56,920 --> 0:29:59,260
 And then we have Pixiflute.

504
0:29:59,640 --> 0:30:04,480
 This is actually the picture is from the second incident.

505
0:30:05,220 --> 0:30:06,920
 Red means fool.

506
0:30:07,340 --> 0:30:08,640
 Just saying if you had doubts.

507
0:30:09,380 --> 0:30:11,880
 So, let's just do a quick analysis of this drawing.

508
0:30:14,080 --> 0:30:14,560
 Okay.

509
0:30:14,860 --> 0:30:26,520
 So, let's start a random place that is actually pumping 97% of its capacity.

510
0:30:26,700 --> 0:30:28,920
 It's a 10-gig connection into the network.

511
0:30:29,360 --> 0:30:33,000
 And then a similar number appears on all the other ones.

512
0:30:34,460 --> 0:30:34,840
 Hmm.

513
0:30:35,160 --> 0:30:36,880
 Makes you wonder what's going on, right?

514
0:30:39,660 --> 0:30:40,820
 Yeah, yeah.

515
0:30:42,420 --> 0:30:44,840
 It was an interesting problem that I have.

516
0:30:44,920 --> 0:30:45,700
 I haven't encountered before.

517
0:30:46,300 --> 0:30:52,300
 The thing is that when you have a normal switch, right, it monitors the traffic.

518
0:30:52,520 --> 0:30:54,800
 And it knows which MAC addresses are on which port.

519
0:30:54,960 --> 0:30:57,380
 And that way, it knows to route stuff left and right.

520
0:30:57,440 --> 0:30:58,980
 So, it doesn't ship everything everywhere.

521
0:30:59,460 --> 0:31:02,840
 But the first time it sees a MAC address, it doesn't know where to ship it.

522
0:31:02,860 --> 0:31:04,260
 So, it ships it on all ports.

523
0:31:04,260 --> 0:31:08,160
 It falls back to, let's call it, hop mode, which is mighty nice.

524
0:31:10,540 --> 0:31:14,220
 Pixiflute, where you pump out insane amounts of gigabits of traffic.

525
0:31:14,860 --> 0:31:17,560
 It's a one-way thing where you're just sending UDP packages.

526
0:31:18,520 --> 0:31:24,980
 So, what if the server that is sending has a higher timeout than the switch?

527
0:31:24,980 --> 0:31:32,600
 It means that the server knows the MAC address of the IP it's trying to send to, but the switch forgets it.

528
0:31:33,020 --> 0:31:33,860
 What happens then?

529
0:31:34,760 --> 0:31:35,920
 Then you get this.

530
0:31:37,040 --> 0:31:40,680
 Because there's no traffic going back from the Pixiflute server.

531
0:31:40,980 --> 0:31:42,080
 It's not talking to anyone.

532
0:31:42,640 --> 0:31:43,980
 So, the switch doesn't...

533
0:31:44,860 --> 0:31:46,200
 It does not learn where the MAC address is.

534
0:31:47,480 --> 0:31:47,920
 Okay.

535
0:31:48,560 --> 0:31:53,540
 So, if we set up our thing that pings every, I don't know, minute, we would not have this.

536
0:31:54,100 --> 0:31:55,140
 It was a weird issue.

537
0:31:55,300 --> 0:31:58,520
 And I think we need to analyze it a bit to ensure that it doesn't happen again.

538
0:31:58,620 --> 0:32:01,520
 Because Pixiflute is, in my opinion, an evil protocol.

539
0:32:01,520 --> 0:32:05,720
 It's just, think of all the CO2 you're burning off while sending all the...

540
0:32:05,720 --> 0:32:06,200
 Never mind.

541
0:32:06,500 --> 0:32:07,260
 I don't care, actually.

542
0:32:07,780 --> 0:32:13,520
 But it's a weird protocol that you are just pumping so much data in one way and never getting anything back.

543
0:32:14,340 --> 0:32:14,420
 It's...

544
0:32:14,860 --> 0:32:19,240
 It's worse than streaming services and such.

545
0:32:19,720 --> 0:32:21,160
 They are shipping a lot back.

546
0:32:23,160 --> 0:32:23,400
 Anyway.

547
0:32:24,400 --> 0:32:24,620
 Cool.

548
0:32:24,620 --> 0:32:35,080
 So, as I mentioned, we have our 3G connection from Global Connect, right?

549
0:32:39,900 --> 0:32:44,200
 It's just, I'm pretty sure that we don't have a 3G connection.

550
0:32:44,860 --> 0:32:45,720
 I'm pretty sure.

551
0:32:46,940 --> 0:32:48,800
 And that's some...

552
0:32:48,800 --> 0:32:55,260
 It's an interesting thing because when you order a 3G connection, the hardware is actually 10 gig.

553
0:32:55,360 --> 0:33:00,620
 And then normally, or not normally, I don't know, they write somewhere in a switch or something

554
0:33:00,620 --> 0:33:02,840
 that we should cap this at 3 gigabit.

555
0:33:03,640 --> 0:33:06,220
 But apparently, misconfiguration and such.

556
0:33:08,580 --> 0:33:08,840
 Yes.

557
0:33:08,940 --> 0:33:10,220
 I was looking at this graph.

558
0:33:12,720 --> 0:33:14,700
 When we got to this part here.

559
0:33:14,860 --> 0:33:17,300
 I was looking at that.

560
0:33:17,560 --> 0:33:18,640
 Nothing, nothing, nothing.

561
0:33:18,960 --> 0:33:20,220
 Oh, something's happening.

562
0:33:21,340 --> 0:33:21,500
 Hmm.

563
0:33:22,280 --> 0:33:24,540
 Have pyjamas started their system now?

564
0:33:26,260 --> 0:33:29,400
 And it turned out it would be some benchmarking in the habitat tent.

565
0:33:29,520 --> 0:33:29,980
 Okay, fine.

566
0:33:30,240 --> 0:33:31,120
 And I thought, okay.

567
0:33:31,600 --> 0:33:32,380
 That's okay.

568
0:33:32,680 --> 0:33:35,240
 They're using 1 gig here, 2 gig...

569
0:33:35,240 --> 0:33:36,720
 1 gig down, 2 gig up.

570
0:33:37,140 --> 0:33:38,700
 That's okay, right?

571
0:33:39,380 --> 0:33:41,340
 And then a bit later...

572
0:33:41,340 --> 0:33:44,180
 Oh, okay, fine.

573
0:33:44,260 --> 0:33:44,840
 They turned on something.

574
0:33:44,840 --> 0:33:45,440
 Something extra.

575
0:33:46,000 --> 0:33:46,780
 And that's very cool.

576
0:33:47,220 --> 0:33:49,120
 This was Labitat playing with...

577
0:33:49,120 --> 0:33:52,480
 I actually don't know, but it's probably benchmarking because...

578
0:33:52,480 --> 0:33:52,960
 iPerf.

579
0:33:53,440 --> 0:33:54,380
 iPerf, yes.

580
0:33:55,000 --> 0:34:01,820
 The good thing about speed testing big connections is that you move a lot of data and it's basically useless.

581
0:34:03,280 --> 0:34:05,660
 Unless, of course, you speed test speed tests.

582
0:34:08,820 --> 0:34:10,720
 Which looks like this.

583
0:34:11,060 --> 0:34:12,540
 No, this is not speed test, speed test.

584
0:34:12,540 --> 0:34:13,540
 This is apparently...

585
0:34:14,840 --> 0:34:18,120
 10 Raspberry Pis doing iPerf or speed test or something.

586
0:34:19,120 --> 0:34:21,600
 So, I'm thinking...

587
0:34:21,600 --> 0:34:22,460
 Do you remember before?

588
0:34:22,600 --> 0:34:24,160
 Let's just go back before.

589
0:34:25,920 --> 0:34:27,680
 This is Labitat playing, right?

590
0:34:30,380 --> 0:34:32,480
 And this is pyjamas playing.

591
0:34:33,900 --> 0:34:35,720
 You don't have a competition, do you?

592
0:34:38,280 --> 0:34:39,840
 So, basically...

593
0:34:40,460 --> 0:34:42,840
 And if you look at the number down here...

594
0:34:42,840 --> 0:34:46,900
 9.76 gigabits.

595
0:34:47,600 --> 0:34:50,300
 I think it's going to be very hard to get...

596
0:34:50,300 --> 0:34:51,480
 This is five minutes averages.

597
0:34:52,260 --> 0:34:53,400
 This is not peaks.

598
0:34:53,480 --> 0:34:55,340
 This is not maximum values for a second or something.

599
0:34:55,560 --> 0:34:56,680
 This is five minutes averages.

600
0:34:58,000 --> 0:35:00,660
 I'm pretty sure we're never going to see 10 on this one.

601
0:35:00,740 --> 0:35:02,840
 I think this is so close to max that it's...

602
0:35:04,000 --> 0:35:04,520
 Yeah.

603
0:35:04,520 --> 0:35:12,440
 I think we can conclude that we actually did fill all the upload capabilities on this camp.

604
0:35:12,840 --> 0:35:13,640
 All 10 gigs.

605
0:35:14,000 --> 0:35:20,980
 The 20 second averages is peaked out at 9.961.

606
0:35:21,240 --> 0:35:21,480
 Okay.

607
0:35:28,960 --> 0:35:31,660
 I think that's close enough to 10 gigs for me.

608
0:35:33,120 --> 0:35:36,500
 So, now I can go to Tykling and say...

609
0:35:36,500 --> 0:35:37,320
 Look, Tykling.

610
0:35:37,700 --> 0:35:39,640
 We obviously need 10 gig.

611
0:35:41,440 --> 0:35:41,840
 Yeah.

612
0:35:42,300 --> 0:35:42,560
 Yeah.

613
0:35:42,840 --> 0:35:43,800
 Maybe not.

614
0:35:43,900 --> 0:35:44,180
 But anyway.

615
0:35:44,840 --> 0:35:51,240
 So, this is what happened over there at the end.

616
0:35:51,480 --> 0:35:55,540
 Was that apparently someone could not install our Linux server.

617
0:35:55,720 --> 0:35:59,600
 So, somebody talked to Pyjamas about stopping something.

618
0:36:00,060 --> 0:36:02,960
 And then suddenly we had a drop of 8 gigabits per second.

619
0:36:03,420 --> 0:36:05,920
 So, it might have been Pyjamas doing these things.

620
0:36:06,780 --> 0:36:07,340
 Anyway.

621
0:36:07,340 --> 0:36:07,420
 Thank you.

622
0:36:12,840 --> 0:36:14,120
 Sorry.

623
0:36:14,520 --> 0:36:15,920
 What about the fear that was promised?

624
0:36:17,840 --> 0:36:19,160
 Let me get back to that one.

625
0:36:19,260 --> 0:36:21,000
 That's actually what I'm going to close off by.

626
0:36:24,220 --> 0:36:24,640
 Fine.

627
0:36:25,520 --> 0:36:27,340
 This is actually the last slide apparently.

628
0:36:29,540 --> 0:36:29,940
 Okay.

629
0:36:29,940 --> 0:36:40,780
 So, we had this agreement with Pyjamas about filling the bandwidth with bandwidth usage

630
0:36:40,780 --> 0:36:42,660
 for the common good we agreed on.

631
0:36:42,840 --> 0:36:48,520
 And very intentionally it was just super vague because I saw what they were doing last year

632
0:36:48,520 --> 0:36:50,860
 and just let them do their thing.

633
0:36:50,960 --> 0:36:51,700
 See what happens.

634
0:36:52,320 --> 0:36:53,320
 But apparently...

635
0:36:53,320 --> 0:36:58,620
 Because I actually know that using a lot of bandwidth just for single services is actually

636
0:36:58,620 --> 0:37:02,320
 not that simple unless you do speed tests.

637
0:37:03,500 --> 0:37:07,720
 That's just a sure way of using insane amounts of bandwidth and it's just...

638
0:37:07,720 --> 0:37:07,980
 Yeah.

639
0:37:09,400 --> 0:37:10,220
 It's not...

640
0:37:10,220 --> 0:37:11,900
 In my opinion, it's just a waste.

641
0:37:11,900 --> 0:37:12,300
 And it's just...

642
0:37:12,300 --> 0:37:15,300
 It's close to how I feel about pixel flood.

643
0:37:15,300 --> 0:37:16,300
 It's just...

644
0:37:16,300 --> 0:37:17,300
 Oh, it's just so stupid.

645
0:37:17,300 --> 0:37:18,300
 Come on.

646
0:37:19,300 --> 0:37:21,720
 But it's on the internal network and nice.

647
0:37:21,720 --> 0:37:22,720
 It's okay.

648
0:37:22,720 --> 0:37:26,440
 We can test if the equipment can actually handle all this line and nothing leaks out

649
0:37:26,440 --> 0:37:27,960
 or blinds people or something.

650
0:37:27,960 --> 0:37:29,480
 So let's send a lot of packages that way.

651
0:37:29,480 --> 0:37:31,140
 And as long as it's internal, I don't care.

652
0:37:31,140 --> 0:37:33,960
 I just think people really like it.

653
0:37:33,960 --> 0:37:38,940
 So that I think it's lame is just me not understanding what all the young people want in this world

654
0:37:38,940 --> 0:37:39,940
 or something.

655
0:37:40,940 --> 0:37:41,940
 So.

656
0:37:41,940 --> 0:37:42,680
 It's just...

657
0:37:42,680 --> 0:37:43,680
 I think we need to do a little juices for the common good.

658
0:37:43,680 --> 0:37:47,460
 When we see what the torrent did, I think that would be common good.

659
0:37:47,460 --> 0:37:52,300
 But if you set something up, a torrent that pulls 10 gigs, which is...

660
0:37:52,300 --> 0:37:53,640
 Yeah, about that.

661
0:37:53,640 --> 0:37:57,580
 So we have not been throttling anyone this year.

662
0:37:57,580 --> 0:38:03,620
 We need to do a bit of the core switch to QFX is need a firmware upgrade that we're

663
0:38:03,620 --> 0:38:09,680
 going to do after camp so that next year we can have some solid quality of service so

664
0:38:09,680 --> 0:38:10,940
 that we can just say, this is for us.

665
0:38:10,940 --> 0:38:11,940
 I don't know.

666
0:38:11,940 --> 0:38:18,500
 normal people. This is for the talk tent. This is for the knock team. Prioritize them,

667
0:38:18,500 --> 0:38:23,700
 all the important parts. And then everybody with 10 gigs to their tents, hey, go do your

668
0:38:23,700 --> 0:38:28,520
 thing. And that's something we're going to set up next year.

669
0:38:28,520 --> 0:38:34,420
 But looking at what the pyjamas did, I was looking at the graphs thinking, now they turned

670
0:38:34,420 --> 0:38:39,860
 it on. Now they turned it on. I was just so sad that you didn't succeed in your little

671
0:38:39,860 --> 0:38:43,840
 pet project. I was just so sad that it didn't happen.

672
0:38:43,840 --> 0:38:51,640
 But it's just fine. We can call it competition, so we won by having a misconfiguration at

673
0:38:51,640 --> 0:38:58,180
 Global Connect. Yeah, OK, fine. If we did not have that misconfiguration, you guys were

674
0:38:58,180 --> 0:39:04,780
 able to use your Raspberry Pi system to actually saturate the system. I think that would be

675
0:39:04,780 --> 0:39:08,780
 interesting to see. So next year, I really want you guys to try again.

676
0:39:08,780 --> 0:39:09,780
 I do not.

677
0:39:09,780 --> 0:39:13,560
 And I think I perhaps need to discuss this a bit with Orca or the other NOC team,

678
0:39:13,700 --> 0:39:17,020
 but this could actually be a recurring competition.

679
0:39:17,300 --> 0:39:19,180
 I would have no issues with that.

680
0:39:19,180 --> 0:39:24,120
 So we could use all these bandwidths for something good that benefits the world and go for it, right?

681
0:39:24,900 --> 0:39:34,980
 So actually, the last question here is, so most of you have also saw the talk by Aspian about what Pyjamas did.

682
0:39:35,400 --> 0:39:38,440
 So should they get a consolation prize?

683
0:39:38,540 --> 0:39:38,960
 What do you think?

684
0:39:39,780 --> 0:39:40,020
 Yeah!

685
0:39:52,160 --> 0:39:58,800
 As opposed to popular belief, I actually organized this a week ago because I truly believed in you guys,

686
0:39:58,980 --> 0:40:03,220
 but this is a prize that you can get anyway.

687
0:40:09,780 --> 0:40:11,940
 Thank you.

688
0:40:11,940 --> 0:40:12,000
 Thank you.

689
0:40:18,540 --> 0:40:19,100
 Yes.

690
0:40:19,640 --> 0:40:24,840
 So let's see if we have this recurring competition.

691
0:40:25,400 --> 0:40:31,960
 And if it becomes a recurring competition, I think that there might actually be configuration stuff for the NOC team to do,

692
0:40:32,320 --> 0:40:33,700
 also known as work.

693
0:40:34,840 --> 0:40:35,920
 Sorry, guys.

694
0:40:36,800 --> 0:40:38,020
 Yeah, silly me.

695
0:40:38,020 --> 0:40:39,540
 Oh, that's poor management.

696
0:40:39,780 --> 0:40:40,920
 Yeah, okay, fine.

697
0:40:42,100 --> 0:40:46,880
 Anyway, that was what I wanted to talk about in this presentation.

698
0:40:47,620 --> 0:40:49,300
 Do you guys have any questions?

699
0:40:51,400 --> 0:40:56,280
 Glad to see the network team declaring war against one village and then bribing them with Zewa Pluto,

700
0:40:56,420 --> 0:40:57,720
 but let's take some questions here.

701
0:40:57,800 --> 0:40:58,840
 This is BornHack.

702
0:41:00,940 --> 0:41:07,280
 I didn't see the numbers, but how much did we download in total over the duration of BornHack?

703
0:41:08,280 --> 0:41:08,760
 Yes.

704
0:41:09,780 --> 0:41:11,840
 I actually found that graph, two seconds.

705
0:41:11,960 --> 0:41:13,420
 It's actually on the very first slide.

706
0:41:19,420 --> 0:41:24,460
 So it's here.

707
0:41:24,820 --> 0:41:27,020
 Total of, well, 92 terabytes.

708
0:41:27,160 --> 0:41:28,260
 This was last evening.

709
0:41:29,480 --> 0:41:34,200
 So we have 60 terabytes inbound and 30 terabytes outbound.

710
0:41:35,960 --> 0:41:37,560
 It's a bit more than I use at home.

711
0:41:39,780 --> 0:41:42,020
 Repeat, please.

712
0:41:45,940 --> 0:41:46,420
 Yes.

713
0:41:50,420 --> 0:41:53,040
 The NOC team told Pyjamas to stop.

714
0:41:53,800 --> 0:41:54,980
 How is that not winning?

715
0:41:55,720 --> 0:41:59,940
 It's because, actually, we had a discussion about this.

716
0:42:00,420 --> 0:42:05,160
 It had to be bandwidth usage for the common good, not just bandwidth usage.

717
0:42:06,840 --> 0:42:09,520
 And this thing about running speed tests to see,

718
0:42:09,520 --> 0:42:12,620
 if you could reach 10 gig, is not for the common good.

719
0:42:13,820 --> 0:42:16,720
 So I'm pretty sure that we are aligned on this one.

720
0:42:17,060 --> 0:42:22,580
 So there was nobody complaining when we told them to stop it because they knew that, yeah.

721
0:42:25,840 --> 0:42:29,080
 Just we expect to have these QFXs next year,

722
0:42:29,160 --> 0:42:33,660
 and we will probably have 10 gig ports enough for just about everyone that needs it.

723
0:42:33,720 --> 0:42:35,760
 So bring 10 gig switches next year.

724
0:42:36,100 --> 0:42:38,580
 You should expect that it's a single mode fiber,

725
0:42:38,580 --> 0:42:39,500
 and you should bring.

726
0:42:39,580 --> 0:42:40,580
 Bring that yourself.

727
0:42:40,580 --> 0:42:43,980
 And then if you can bring two optics, then you are insured a port,

728
0:42:43,980 --> 0:42:45,780
 because then we have the ports available.

729
0:42:46,120 --> 0:42:50,760
 But at least bring 10 gig switches with two optics, one single mode fiber.

730
0:42:50,980 --> 0:42:53,180
 And if you have a 100 meter cable, that should be enough.

731
0:42:53,660 --> 0:42:58,720
 And I will make sure to bring at least 20 10 gig ports for the party area.

732
0:42:59,020 --> 0:43:02,320
 So if you want to be insured to have 10 gig, come to the party area.

733
0:43:04,420 --> 0:43:04,920
 Yes.

734
0:43:05,320 --> 0:43:06,220
 Any other questions?

735
0:43:06,680 --> 0:43:08,160
 Fiber to the tent for the win.

736
0:43:08,260 --> 0:43:08,760
 Yes.

737
0:43:08,760 --> 0:43:09,260
 Yes.

738
0:43:09,980 --> 0:43:10,480
 Yes.

739
0:43:10,900 --> 0:43:12,760
 Let's give a huge round of applause to the network team.
