0:00:00,000 --> 0:00:21,600
 Let's give a big hand to the last speaker, we have this here, Tyk with Goodbye World.

2
0:00:21,600 --> 0:00:23,560
 Thank you, everybody.

3
0:00:23,560 --> 0:00:28,900
 We are nearing the end of what has been an amazing BornHack 2023.

4
0:00:28,900 --> 0:00:32,940
 It is always a bit weird.

5
0:00:32,940 --> 0:00:38,860
 The week goes by incredibly fast, it feels like, and so much has happened that it can

6
0:00:38,860 --> 0:00:42,120
 be difficult to get your head around it.

7
0:00:42,120 --> 0:00:45,780
 We had some weather over the last couple of days.

8
0:00:45,780 --> 0:00:50,580
 We have reduced the number of pavilions significantly on the site.

9
0:00:50,580 --> 0:00:57,960
 I guess we can say that starting teardown early, unplanned teardown, most of the important

10
0:00:58,000 --> 0:01:05,800
 things are still standing and we hope that the worst of the weather has passed.

11
0:01:05,800 --> 0:01:12,120
 Especially right after this, where we hope to take down the big tent, please stay dry.

12
0:01:12,120 --> 0:01:17,920
 I have a lot of fun stats about the week that went by and some practical info.

13
0:01:17,920 --> 0:01:22,680
 I want to start out by talking a little bit about Graffen.

14
0:01:22,680 --> 0:01:27,760
 As you remember from Hello World, and as most of you know, we lost an organizer this year.

15
0:01:27,760 --> 0:01:33,000
 Last year, but between the last BornHack and this BornHack.

16
0:01:33,000 --> 0:01:39,680
 We have been struggling to figure out a good way to remember him and we've decided to plant

17
0:01:39,680 --> 0:01:42,200
 a tree here at Hylkedom.

18
0:01:42,200 --> 0:01:49,640
 It will be placed out here by the radio tower and it is being delivered the day after tomorrow.

19
0:01:49,640 --> 0:01:55,280
 Probably there's some logistics involved when you're getting a sizable tree delivered.

20
0:01:55,360 --> 0:02:00,240
 We hope it will be here no later than Thursday.

21
0:02:00,240 --> 0:02:06,960
 We have put up a mailbox in the bar where everybody is encouraged to write a letter

22
0:02:06,960 --> 0:02:12,320
 to Graffen and all the letters will be buried under the tree, put in the hole before we

23
0:02:12,320 --> 0:02:18,680
 put in the tree, when we put it in on Thursday or whenever it's going to be.

24
0:02:18,680 --> 0:02:24,480
 The mailbox is in the bar and we hope you will take time to write down some thoughts.

25
0:02:24,480 --> 0:02:26,800
 You will never read it.

26
0:02:26,800 --> 0:02:29,600
 So it's more for you than for anyone else.

27
0:02:46,080 --> 0:02:48,680
 The tree is a Silver Linden.

28
0:02:48,760 --> 0:02:54,960
 I don't know much about trees, but it's pretty and we hope it will be here for many years.

29
0:02:56,960 --> 0:03:00,480
 Okay, let's get on to the more fun stuff.

30
0:03:11,080 --> 0:03:14,000
 Statistics, we all love that, right?

31
0:03:14,000 --> 0:03:16,640
 The program grew significantly this year.

32
0:03:16,640 --> 0:03:24,280
 There was a few talks, but overall it was a more full program than it has ever been

33
0:03:24,280 --> 0:03:25,280
 before.

34
0:03:25,280 --> 0:03:26,960
 Thank you to everybody who submitted.

35
0:03:26,960 --> 0:03:33,400
 We had 23 of the regular talks, which is fewer than last year, 11 lightning talks, which

36
0:03:33,400 --> 0:03:39,760
 is quite a bit more than last year, 18 workshops, which is a lot and some of them were way overcrowded

37
0:03:39,760 --> 0:03:42,640
 so there could probably have been more.

38
0:03:42,640 --> 0:03:48,400
 We had the panel debate, which was, again, a great success, and 12 meetups this year,

39
0:03:48,400 --> 0:03:55,560
 which is double what we had last year, a couple of music acts and 19 recreational events,

40
0:03:55,560 --> 0:04:00,160
 various things submitted by villages and everything, and it's been so good to see all the activities

41
0:04:00,160 --> 0:04:01,440
 going on.

42
0:04:01,440 --> 0:04:05,920
 The content team has been working hard putting this together and all the people who submitted.

43
0:04:05,920 --> 0:04:06,920
 Thank you all.

44
0:04:06,920 --> 0:04:09,440
 Let's give everybody involved a big round of applause.

45
0:04:12,640 --> 0:04:22,640
 And, of course, let's not forget the video team, who are tirelessly working to stream

46
0:04:22,640 --> 0:04:29,240
 locally and stream online, and also everything is being recorded, so we can go, let's give

47
0:04:29,240 --> 0:04:30,240
 it a month.

48
0:04:30,240 --> 0:04:35,760
 We have to recover a bit, but pretty soon you'll be able to see it on media.ccc.de once we've

49
0:04:35,760 --> 0:04:41,160
 done the post-processing and stuff, and the video team has been handling all that like

50
0:04:41,680 --> 0:04:52,080
 So thank you for that.

51
0:04:52,080 --> 0:04:56,560
 The NOC team has, as always, delivered an impressive infrastructure out here in the

52
0:04:56,560 --> 0:04:57,920
 middle of nowhere.

53
0:04:57,920 --> 0:05:04,680
 We had a very fast doubling speed, so I think I saw a speed test from a tent of 8.5 gigabits

54
0:05:04,680 --> 0:05:09,800
 or something, and that's out to the outside world.

55
0:05:10,040 --> 0:05:14,120
 35 access points were put up by NOC for the Wi-Fi.

56
0:05:14,120 --> 0:05:23,880
 300, almost 350 unique connected devices, or no, max, simultaneous, I think it means.

57
0:05:23,880 --> 0:05:31,000
 Quite some data was pulled through our connection, 42 terabytes uploaded and 6 terabytes downloaded,

58
0:05:31,000 --> 0:05:36,840
 and of the 42 terabytes, a single tent and a single user is responsible for 90% of it,

59
0:05:36,840 --> 0:05:45,160
 so well done.

60
0:05:45,160 --> 0:05:49,400
 I happen to know it is data going through a really good course, so it is very good to

61
0:05:49,400 --> 0:05:52,400
 see.

62
0:05:52,400 --> 0:05:58,280
 Bar numbers, as you know, we depend on the bar to stay above water financially, and you

63
0:05:58,280 --> 0:06:00,160
 have been very good at using the bar.

64
0:06:00,160 --> 0:06:01,640
 We really appreciate it.

65
0:06:01,640 --> 0:06:03,920
 There's some impressive stats from down there.

66
0:06:04,000 --> 0:06:13,920
 They sold 3,700 things, over 2,600 transactions, 628 cocktails, I may be responsible for quite

67
0:06:13,920 --> 0:06:23,120
 a few of those, 619 litres of beer, I am absolutely responsible for zero of those, 445 litres

68
0:06:23,120 --> 0:06:30,360
 of mate, same, 17 tsunamis, I may also be involved there, and we had this year four

69
0:06:30,560 --> 0:06:35,960
 free cakes bought by participants in the bar and put up for free for everybody to drink,

70
0:06:35,960 --> 0:06:41,840
 three of them were weddings and the last one was 40 around birthday.

71
0:06:41,840 --> 0:06:50,040
 The bar has been open almost like I've been awake, there hasn't been many times where

72
0:06:50,040 --> 0:06:55,800
 I've walked by the bar and it's been closed, and it's down to an amazing bar team, both

73
0:06:55,800 --> 0:07:00,920
 constructing it and keeping it alive and involving over the week, and also cleaning

74
0:07:00,920 --> 0:07:03,960
 up and doing everything that's needed to keep the bar running.

75
0:07:03,960 --> 0:07:05,960
 Let's give them a big round of applause.

76
0:07:17,600 --> 0:07:23,800
 So the game team once again organised an amazing token game, it's sort of a treasure hunt for

77
0:07:23,800 --> 0:07:30,160
 little text rings all over the venue, they are offline and online and all over the place,

78
0:07:30,160 --> 0:07:39,080
 60 people took place in the contest and 27 tokens were found and 242 times a token was

79
0:07:39,080 --> 0:07:40,080
 found.

80
0:07:40,080 --> 0:07:42,240
 Game team, do we have a winner to announce?

81
0:07:42,240 --> 0:07:43,640
 They have been announced.

82
0:07:43,640 --> 0:07:45,480
 Oh, I didn't see, sorry.

83
0:07:45,480 --> 0:07:49,240
 The winner has been announced and I hope they are happy they got a free ticket for next

84
0:07:49,240 --> 0:07:51,880
 year's event.

85
0:07:51,880 --> 0:07:54,280
 Let's give them a big round of applause to the game team.

86
0:08:02,280 --> 0:08:07,920
 Between the token game and the jeopardy and everything, they are really doing a lot of

87
0:08:07,920 --> 0:08:13,160
 work that used to fall on Orga, so we are very, very happy with that and it's working

88
0:08:13,160 --> 0:08:17,280
 so well, so thank you.

89
0:08:17,280 --> 0:08:21,720
 The shuttle team has also been busy this year, they almost got out of it, we almost didn't

90
0:08:21,720 --> 0:08:26,920
 get a shuttle car but we managed to get one last minute thanks to Dennis who helped find

91
0:08:26,920 --> 0:08:28,880
 the sponsor.

92
0:08:28,880 --> 0:08:33,360
 The shuttle team does the drives back and forth to the station mostly and to the supermarket

93
0:08:33,360 --> 0:08:36,360
 occasionally.

94
0:08:36,360 --> 0:08:43,960
 47 trips and a lot of communication and coordination in the mailbox and a few jumping runs.

95
0:08:43,960 --> 0:08:49,320
 They are still doing shuttle runs, so when you need to leave tomorrow or whenever you

96
0:08:49,960 --> 0:08:55,680
 need to leave, you can write an email to the shuttle team and hopefully they can take you.

97
0:08:55,680 --> 0:09:02,200
 I don't even see, I hope Floma is here and some of the other shuttle team people because

98
0:09:02,200 --> 0:09:06,840
 they really provide a service that for participants at least makes it so much easier to get to

99
0:09:06,840 --> 0:09:18,840
 and from the event, so thank you to them.

100
0:09:18,840 --> 0:09:23,500
 The power team has again rolled out an impressive amount of copper on the venue, so we could

101
0:09:23,500 --> 0:09:29,600
 all get something resembling 230 volts.

102
0:09:29,600 --> 0:09:37,240
 It is tricky with the resources we have available and the way the power is wired on the venue,

103
0:09:37,240 --> 0:09:42,500
 it is very difficult to provide stable power at the voltages we would like to but they

104
0:09:42,500 --> 0:09:50,660
 are again and again proving that it can be done with a few low voltages here and there

105
0:09:50,660 --> 0:09:56,580
 and a few fallouts because of water in village equipment and stuff.

106
0:09:56,580 --> 0:10:00,980
 It is very hard to avoid completely because with the weather we have been having, it is

107
0:10:00,980 --> 0:10:04,260
 tricky keeping water out of everything.

108
0:10:04,260 --> 0:10:08,740
 When you do take down your village, please unplug stuff before you start touching the

109
0:10:08,740 --> 0:10:13,380
 roof and stuff so we don't get any outages during tear down.

110
0:10:13,380 --> 0:10:17,300
 The power team has been very quick to respond when there has been outages.

111
0:10:17,300 --> 0:10:23,020
 They go from distribution point to distribution point and try to turn it off and isolate and

112
0:10:23,020 --> 0:10:27,180
 eventually find the culprit and get it fixed and everybody has power again.

113
0:10:27,180 --> 0:10:29,380
 It is usually a quick process.

114
0:10:29,380 --> 0:10:43,940
 Thank you so much to the power team, Flemming and the others.

115
0:10:43,940 --> 0:10:50,020
 As you may know, we are about 10 people or 11 people in the organ group and it takes

116
0:10:50,020 --> 0:10:53,320
 maybe 50 people to run this event or more.

117
0:10:53,320 --> 0:11:00,040
 We would be unable to even begin considering doing this if we didn't get all the help

118
0:11:00,040 --> 0:11:02,640
 from all the volunteers, especially this year.

119
0:11:02,640 --> 0:11:09,160
 It has been a joy, there has been volunteer meetings every day at 14 in what used to be

120
0:11:09,160 --> 0:11:14,360
 the start center across from the info desk until it disappeared and people have been

121
0:11:14,360 --> 0:11:20,720
 willing and have been helping out even on their own discovering things and just putting

122
0:11:20,720 --> 0:11:23,000
 a message in the signal group, this was off.

123
0:11:23,080 --> 0:11:25,240
 I fixed it, you don't need to worry about it.

124
0:11:25,240 --> 0:11:33,400
 It is such a huge load of organ specs, which means that we've had excess cycles to do other

125
0:11:33,400 --> 0:11:39,400
 stuff that would usually pile up towards the end of the event, stuff like economy, stuff

126
0:11:39,400 --> 0:11:44,600
 that's usually lying because that can be pushed forward.

127
0:11:44,600 --> 0:11:49,440
 It means a lot to us because when we get home, we, like everybody else, need to wind down

128
0:11:49,440 --> 0:11:52,680
 and that's difficult when you know you have a pile of work waiting for you.

129
0:11:52,760 --> 0:11:58,600
 A lot of that has already been done from day to day and that's all thanks to all the volunteers.

130
0:11:58,600 --> 0:12:02,040
 Can everybody who helped out please stand up and be applauded?

131
0:12:23,560 --> 0:12:31,400
 We are preparing tear down right after this talk, we'll take down this tent, I'll talk

132
0:12:31,400 --> 0:12:36,720
 more about that after, but tomorrow at noon, the event is officially over and then we'll

133
0:12:36,720 --> 0:12:42,480
 start taking down power and network and all the infrastructure until noon tomorrow, there

134
0:12:42,480 --> 0:12:45,040
 will be full power and network and everything.

135
0:12:45,040 --> 0:12:50,200
 The only thing we are taking down is this tent, but we do need help with tear down so

136
0:12:50,200 --> 0:12:56,360
 if you have one or two extra days and you can stick around and help us sort, carry,

137
0:12:56,360 --> 0:13:03,240
 stack stuff, return it, get it ready to return to all the suppliers who are showing up Thursday

138
0:13:03,240 --> 0:13:09,800
 or Friday to do pickups, the more the merrier, we can always use more hands, Jonathan is

139
0:13:09,800 --> 0:13:14,760
 cooking from starting tomorrow evening and it's always, yes.

140
0:13:21,160 --> 0:13:27,800
 And it is actually always good fun even though it's of course hard work and you have a full

141
0:13:27,800 --> 0:13:33,040
 week of event and maybe even build up in your system already.

142
0:13:33,040 --> 0:13:37,400
 The more the merrier, not all of it is hard work and hopefully the weather will treat

143
0:13:37,400 --> 0:13:46,440
 us nicely and yeah, maybe some bio leftovers, it's usually a good time, fires every evening

144
0:13:46,440 --> 0:13:50,040
 and everything you can want.

145
0:13:50,040 --> 0:13:54,560
 All the work you could ask for.

146
0:13:54,560 --> 0:13:57,400
 Even a little helps, even half a day or something.

147
0:13:57,400 --> 0:14:03,040
 So please consider staying for tear down.

148
0:14:03,040 --> 0:14:08,480
 We had the first coordination meeting at 1600 in the bar start tent where we also had the

149
0:14:08,480 --> 0:14:13,160
 volunteer meetings during build up.

150
0:14:13,160 --> 0:14:19,800
 The tent is disassembling itself as we speak, it knows what's about to happen.

151
0:14:19,800 --> 0:14:25,040
 So at 16 tomorrow in the start tent by the bar we will have the first coordination meeting

152
0:14:25,040 --> 0:14:29,480
 and at 19 we will have the first official tear down meal and those of you who have tried

153
0:14:29,480 --> 0:14:36,220
 it before know after each meal they will be 9, 13 and 19, we have a coordination meeting

154
0:14:36,220 --> 0:14:39,240
 and hand out the tasks.

155
0:14:39,240 --> 0:14:43,840
 We have the venue until Saturday officially, we are aiming for most things to be fixed

156
0:14:43,840 --> 0:14:53,600
 by Friday, barring any violent weather or something can easily delay things but we think

157
0:14:53,600 --> 0:15:00,520
 we should be ready around Friday, Saturday.

158
0:15:00,520 --> 0:15:05,300
 We would like to know what you thought of the event, sometimes it's easier to sit down

159
0:15:05,300 --> 0:15:12,040
 and gather your thoughts and put it in writing and it's easier for us to remember.

160
0:15:12,080 --> 0:15:18,440
 For hack.dk slash feedback, please post positive and negative feedback, it's greatly appreciated

161
0:15:18,440 --> 0:15:23,200
 and there's also an option on the individual events in the program to give feedback to

162
0:15:23,200 --> 0:15:28,240
 the speaker about the event and that is also appreciated by the content team because then

163
0:15:28,240 --> 0:15:37,940
 they know what to get more of next year so the program can be even better.

164
0:15:37,940 --> 0:15:42,380
 If you lost anything or you found something then please take it to the info desk and we

165
0:15:42,380 --> 0:15:47,140
 will try to get it untangled and get the right stuff sent home with the right people so nobody

166
0:15:47,140 --> 0:15:52,220
 leaves anything in funeral.

167
0:15:52,220 --> 0:15:58,540
 Our food vendor will leave tomorrow around 14 so there's time to get lunch tomorrow and

168
0:15:58,540 --> 0:16:07,060
 then there will be a tear down meal in the dinner in the cabin from 19 but we are not

169
0:16:07,180 --> 0:16:13,980
 serving volunteer lunch tomorrow so make sure you eat on your own and then we will start

170
0:16:13,980 --> 0:16:18,020
 taking care of the meals starting tomorrow evening.

171
0:16:18,020 --> 0:16:23,020
 The food area tent will stay up until Thursday and we will start taking it down there so

172
0:16:23,020 --> 0:16:28,180
 there's also the option of cooking for yourself over the next couple of days.

173
0:16:28,180 --> 0:16:33,500
 The food area team has been keeping and we are talking about a two man army or two person

174
0:16:33,580 --> 0:16:38,580
 army has been keeping the food area so nice and tidy so let's give them a big round of

175
0:16:38,580 --> 0:16:39,580
 applause.

176
0:16:39,580 --> 0:16:58,100
 It's a fun story because we didn't quite understand what happened suddenly the food area started

177
0:16:58,100 --> 0:17:01,460
 being really messy and dirty and we had to get cleaners to fix it and everything and

178
0:17:01,460 --> 0:17:05,220
 it turned out that these two lovely people just missed a couple of born hacks and wasn't

179
0:17:05,220 --> 0:17:10,500
 doing all the cleaning they were usually doing and suddenly the absence of something like

180
0:17:10,500 --> 0:17:14,980
 that becomes very obvious when it's not there so they have been doing this.

181
0:17:14,980 --> 0:17:29,660
 We just maybe forgot to notice or appreciate it, fantastic work, thank you.

182
0:17:29,700 --> 0:17:34,860
 We have a tradition that goes back all the way to the first born hack that the speaker's

183
0:17:34,860 --> 0:17:40,860
 chair is built carefully and lovingly and artfully and then when we are done with it

184
0:17:40,860 --> 0:17:48,500
 we burn it and that's kind of a weird tradition but it is a tradition nonetheless and tomorrow

185
0:17:48,500 --> 0:17:54,700
 evening weather permitting or otherwise Thursday we are probably having a fire anyway but one

186
0:17:54,740 --> 0:18:01,140
 of these days the speaker's chair is going it's usually great fun we can get rid of some

187
0:18:01,140 --> 0:18:10,620
 hand sanitiser and the same while we are at it.

188
0:18:10,620 --> 0:18:18,860
 So post camp blues can be pretty rough being surrounded by so many lovely people and enjoying

189
0:18:19,020 --> 0:18:25,300
 the content and the environment and the community and the feeling of togetherness and then returning

190
0:18:25,300 --> 0:18:34,380
 to a pretty bleak reality on the outside of these walls can be a little rough and there's

191
0:18:34,380 --> 0:18:41,380
 nothing to do, you have to come down when you've been up but there are some suggested

192
0:18:41,380 --> 0:18:47,300
 remedies for when you feel the sadness, watch some of the talks you missed, we are getting

193
0:18:47,300 --> 0:18:52,020
 them up as soon as we can, you can play with your badge or some of the previous year's

194
0:18:52,020 --> 0:18:57,300
 badges, you can organise all your pictures and send the cool ones to us if they are in

195
0:18:57,300 --> 0:19:04,020
 a creative commons license so we can use them, we would greatly appreciate that.

196
0:19:04,020 --> 0:19:08,380
 Stay in touch online, we have the ISE channel, we have the signal groups, talk to old and

197
0:19:08,380 --> 0:19:15,180
 new friends, keep the community going throughout the year, buy a ticket for Born Hack 2024,

198
0:19:15,180 --> 0:19:20,740
 they will be for sale as soon as we've recovered from this during the fall at some point and

199
0:19:20,740 --> 0:19:33,900
 keep on hacking.

200
0:19:33,900 --> 0:19:40,540
 Born Hack 2024 has moved forward slightly, it is scheduled for the 17th to the 24th of

201
0:19:40,540 --> 0:19:46,860
 July 2024, it's a Wednesday to Wednesday, we realise moving it is going to be inconvenient

202
0:19:46,860 --> 0:19:53,740
 for some people, for other people it will be convenient, there's no way to make everybody

203
0:19:53,740 --> 0:20:00,260
 happy with this, the current dates like mid August that we've been doing for some years,

204
0:20:00,260 --> 0:20:04,660
 conflict with the big German and Dutch camps in a way that makes it really difficult for

205
0:20:04,660 --> 0:20:09,700
 us to get the venue because this venue has to be booked about two years in advance and

206
0:20:09,740 --> 0:20:14,900
 when the big Dutch and German events don't decide on that date until eight months before,

207
0:20:14,900 --> 0:20:21,100
 then we have, as you can see, an impossible job of picking a date that doesn't conflict

208
0:20:21,100 --> 0:20:26,100
 because we are the small camp, if we end up being at the same time as the CCC camp or

209
0:20:26,100 --> 0:20:30,780
 the Dutch events, we will lose, even Orga would not show up because we want to go to

210
0:20:30,780 --> 0:20:32,420
 the big events too.

211
0:20:32,420 --> 0:20:39,260
 So we want to avoid that and moving it ahead of it means that we dodge both the big German

212
0:20:39,340 --> 0:20:43,740
 and the big Dutch events, there will be other conflicts, some people might be unable to

213
0:20:43,740 --> 0:20:47,820
 attend that have been coming for years, we are very sorry about that, hopefully this

214
0:20:47,820 --> 0:20:52,260
 will allow other people to come and at the very least it will make it so we don't have

215
0:20:52,260 --> 0:20:57,620
 to ask the venue people to move, other people who rented the venue where we needed, so they

216
0:20:57,620 --> 0:21:06,020
 have to cancel other renters at the Hylke Dam so they can fit us in, they did it twice

217
0:21:06,340 --> 0:21:10,660
 and we have been here in four years and it's too stressful and too much to ask, we cannot

218
0:21:10,660 --> 0:21:15,940
 keep doing this and we cannot demand from CCC or the Dutch events that they put their

219
0:21:15,940 --> 0:21:20,300
 dates out several years in advance, that's not going to happen, the only way we can do

220
0:21:20,300 --> 0:21:26,460
 this is to kind of roll with the punches and move to a place in the calendar that doesn't

221
0:21:26,460 --> 0:21:29,060
 have so many big events.

222
0:21:29,060 --> 0:21:34,300
 So Pornhack 2024 will be from the 17th to the 24th of July, we hope very much to see

223
0:21:34,300 --> 0:21:35,580
 you all there.

224
0:21:46,580 --> 0:21:51,500
 Speaking of avoiding Hacker Blues, another way of doing that is just to keep on talking,

225
0:21:51,500 --> 0:21:58,940
 when we are done with Teardown we will repeat our great success from 2019 where the CCC

226
0:21:58,940 --> 0:22:04,060
 camp was also right after Pornhack, what we did was basically finish Teardown, pack everything

227
0:22:04,220 --> 0:22:09,860
 and then do a big convoy of 10-15 vehicles and just drive down there with radios and

228
0:22:09,860 --> 0:22:18,060
 everything, it was amazingly good fun and we arrived at CCC camp, maybe one vehicle

229
0:22:18,060 --> 0:22:23,860
 didn't get there until 48 hours later, that's quite a story, you can ask Omni about that,

230
0:22:23,860 --> 0:22:31,100
 but mostly it went very well and we are repeating it so as soon as we are done here everybody

231
0:22:31,100 --> 0:22:36,540
 gets in their cars and we drive to CCC camp.

232
0:22:36,540 --> 0:22:41,620
 You are welcome to, if you need to leave and come back, you can do that, but most people

233
0:22:41,620 --> 0:22:45,580
 will probably stay and help with Teardown and then leave when we are done.

234
0:22:45,580 --> 0:22:49,660
 It should be good fun and it's a good way to recover from, what better way to recover

235
0:22:49,660 --> 0:22:53,300
 from Pornhack than by going to another Hacker camp.

236
0:22:53,300 --> 0:23:03,860
 Okay, we have some inventory left in the bar that we don't want to carry around too much,

237
0:23:03,860 --> 0:23:09,620
 we would like all of you to take it home, so we are selling boost bottles and infodesk

238
0:23:09,620 --> 0:23:15,980
 at reduced prices, you can get a full bottle for 200 Hacks instead of 300 and there's Akhavit

239
0:23:15,980 --> 0:23:21,820
 and Vodka and Saber Blurter up there, also Mate and Beer I think.

240
0:23:21,860 --> 0:23:26,740
 It should be already ready in the infodesk, I don't think they will open about now and

241
0:23:26,740 --> 0:23:33,540
 be open today and also tomorrow, so when you leave or are about to leave, consider going

242
0:23:33,540 --> 0:23:40,480
 by there and getting some nice Saber Blurter or Akhavit or Vodka to take home, it is also

243
0:23:40,480 --> 0:23:43,620
 a good way to get rid of the Hacker Blues.

244
0:23:43,620 --> 0:23:53,700
 Okay, I'm almost done, we would like some help right now with taking down the speakers

245
0:23:53,700 --> 0:24:00,860
 tent, this is a massively parallelizable job, we could almost do it with a GPU, but we do

246
0:24:00,860 --> 0:24:09,140
 need some help, so it is, once people get up and start running around, it gets a bit

247
0:24:09,140 --> 0:24:15,940
 chaotic, so I'm going to go over it slowly and explain what we would like and once we

248
0:24:15,940 --> 0:24:20,420
 start, please everybody be careful, nobody hurt themselves, we used to time the taking

249
0:24:20,420 --> 0:24:24,540
 down of the speakers tent, we don't do that anymore because people are way too competitive

250
0:24:24,540 --> 0:24:29,260
 and will end up hurting themselves and we of course don't want that.

251
0:24:29,260 --> 0:24:34,860
 We have a bunch of helmets that we are getting for when the frame has to come down, but before

252
0:24:35,660 --> 0:24:41,620
 the very first thing is you get up, take the chair you are sitting on and take it to the

253
0:24:41,620 --> 0:24:47,700
 car, park right outside and stack it inside that, I'm guessing two people inside it to

254
0:24:47,700 --> 0:24:55,300
 stack and then an anthill of people taking out chairs, after that we take out all the

255
0:24:55,300 --> 0:25:01,460
 tables, there is a row of metal frames out here, the tables go on the metal frame, 20

256
0:25:01,620 --> 0:25:06,260
 high or so and then they get a ratchet strap, there will be organisers in these black organ

257
0:25:06,260 --> 0:25:12,980
 vests at all the stacks and they know, all of them know how to stack it, so there is

258
0:25:12,980 --> 0:25:18,380
 nothing worse than having to re-stack a stack of tables that turned out to be stacked wrongly

259
0:25:18,380 --> 0:25:23,740
 or a stack of floor plates in two or three days before they pick it up because our arms

260
0:25:23,740 --> 0:25:27,820
 are hanging down there at that point, so let's get it right the first time, so it is much

261
0:25:27,820 --> 0:25:32,900
 better to do it a little slowly, a little more slowly than to get it wrong and we have

262
0:25:32,900 --> 0:25:41,900
 to redo it, and especially the tables and the floor plates have historically been sources

263
0:25:41,900 --> 0:25:47,660
 of re-stacking work, so let's get it right and just check with the vests before you leave

264
0:25:47,660 --> 0:25:53,740
 anything even though you think you might know how, it's a very, we are all very capable

265
0:25:53,740 --> 0:25:58,500
 in our daily work and it's easy to, I know how to do this, I will just get it going,

266
0:25:58,500 --> 0:26:03,860
 but please check with somebody in a vest before you place things, the chairs go to the Oscar

267
0:26:03,860 --> 0:26:11,740
 van, the tables go on the frames out here and the floors go on the wooden pallets that

268
0:26:11,740 --> 0:26:19,940
 have the big wooden plates on top, the floors kind of snap into each other when you stack

269
0:26:19,940 --> 0:26:25,500
 them so it's not like a pile, it's a very neat pile when you are done, so they click

270
0:26:25,500 --> 0:26:29,780
 into each other so they are completely straight, the sides, so if they are not straight they

271
0:26:29,780 --> 0:26:34,580
 have to be re-stacked, so put it down, get it into place so it clicks in and then put

272
0:26:34,580 --> 0:26:37,240
 the next one in.

273
0:26:37,240 --> 0:26:43,780
 The video team will start taking down all this stuff and they will handle that themselves,

274
0:26:43,780 --> 0:26:47,620
 so tables and chairs and when we are done with that we can start taking up the floor

275
0:26:47,700 --> 0:26:51,740
 and putting that down and taking down the sides and folding those and putting them on

276
0:26:51,740 --> 0:26:53,300
 the pallets.

277
0:26:53,300 --> 0:26:58,300
 If you have questions or doubts then stop working and just stand around and look what

278
0:26:58,300 --> 0:27:08,100
 others are doing or come ask an Oscar person, much rather get it right than doing it twice.

279
0:27:08,100 --> 0:27:12,740
 That is it, we love you all, we will see you next year and thank you for everything.
