0:00:00,000 --> 0:00:18,000
 Welcome to second day with presentations here at BornHack. I would like to welcome Mark-Jan Bastian and your talk about power supply, stability and risks.

2
0:00:18,000 --> 0:00:28,000
 Yes, thank you. Well, welcome everybody. This talk, my name is Mark-Jan Bastian and the presentation is called Power Supply, Stability and Risks.

3
0:00:28,000 --> 0:00:42,000
 For a very quick thing, which I will discuss in this presentation is always verify the operational life of your electrolytic capacitors, perform stability tests for load step up and step down.

4
0:00:42,000 --> 0:00:46,000
 You can do that for example with electronic load.

5
0:00:46,000 --> 0:00:48,000
 Repeat that for every new battery.

6
0:00:48,000 --> 0:00:58,000
 Use a lot of hardware because you never know which kind of chips end up in your supply chain, especially in these days where there is a lot of scarcity of chips.

7
0:00:58,000 --> 0:01:03,000
 And the design time, well there are a few things which you can do.

8
0:01:03,000 --> 0:01:17,000
 The power supply of the control signals in your power source, feedback loops, well that is a very academic topic, but I will just do it very practically which things in practice can go wrong.

9
0:01:17,000 --> 0:01:18,000
 And then you can do a lot of other things. You can do a lot of other things, but I will just do it very practically which things in practice can go wrong.

10
0:01:18,000 --> 0:01:48,000
 And then you can do a lot of other things, but I will just do a lot of other things, but I will just do a lot of other things, but I will just do a lot of other things, but I will just do a lot of other things, but I will just do a lot of other things, but I will just do a lot of other things, but I will just do a lot of other things, but I will just do a lot of other things, but I will just do a lot of other things, but I will just do a lot of other things, but I will just do a lot of other things, but I will just do a lot of other things, but I will just do a lot of other things, but I will just do a lot of other things, but I will just do a lot of other things, but I will just do a lot of other things, but I will just do a lot of other things, but I will just do a lot of other things, but I will just do a lot of other things, but

11
0:01:48,000 --> 0:01:54,440
 so yeah this should be reasonable for any power supply like uh audio amplifier and that kind of

12
0:01:54,440 --> 0:02:00,880
 stuff so uh yeah it was a pretty good deal i got a bit weird things when i was ordering it because

13
0:02:00,880 --> 0:02:08,980
 somebody mentioned uh that there could be a back door into in this power supply i mean well that

14
0:02:08,980 --> 0:02:14,180
 was very interesting and i definitely want that so i bought two of them i mean well how can you

15
0:02:14,180 --> 0:02:18,460
 have a back door in an electronic load that's what's uh well i'll definitely want to check that

16
0:02:18,460 --> 0:02:25,660
 out um there's a there's rs2d3d2 port uh actually serial port on the back which you can use to

17
0:02:25,660 --> 0:02:32,680
 control it uh but well i mean yeah that was a very weird story but well you can just use it with the

18
0:02:32,680 --> 0:02:38,440
 buttons and just verify all the results with your scope uh all the time domains are not uh

19
0:02:38,440 --> 0:02:42,700
 interconnected and the only way they talk to each other is via the line they share so

20
0:02:42,700 --> 0:02:44,160
 yeah i don't see any way

21
0:02:44,180 --> 0:02:49,280
 to make a back door in an electronic load but you could maybe make a back door in a in a power

22
0:02:49,280 --> 0:02:53,460
 supply to actually have it fail at some point so and that's where this talk is about

23
0:02:53,460 --> 0:03:03,180
 and well maybe one of the things that you might be familiar with in 2015 was a user

24
0:03:03,180 --> 0:03:08,040
 on the raspberry pi forum that actually found out that he made if he made a xenon flash

25
0:03:08,040 --> 0:03:13,780
 of his raspberry pi board the power supply crashed and he actually fixed it by putting a piece of

26
0:03:13,780 --> 0:03:14,160
 blue text on the back of the power supply and he actually fixed it by putting a piece of blue text

27
0:03:14,180 --> 0:03:16,820
 uh on his raspberry pi

28
0:03:19,700 --> 0:03:25,540
 and well that's uh that was actually uh very interesting of course well that's that looks like

29
0:03:25,540 --> 0:03:33,380
 a an attack on the power supply and that was actually due to uh the the power supply the

30
0:03:33,380 --> 0:03:37,860
 power controller itself it was kind of transparent for the wavelength of xenon

31
0:03:37,860 --> 0:03:43,780
 and actually uh well caused a glitch which caused a power outage in the raspberry pi

32
0:03:44,180 --> 0:03:49,620
 and then caused a reset so that was quite interesting but well relatively easy to fix

33
0:03:53,300 --> 0:03:56,340
 well then well we'll go into the several uh power

34
0:03:58,180 --> 0:04:02,180
 power supply circuits that you can find on any board or if you design your own board

35
0:04:02,180 --> 0:04:09,060
 most common already since the 70s or maybe even earlier is a linear regulator which

36
0:04:09,060 --> 0:04:13,540
 basically transistor which controls the current from v into v out and all power

37
0:04:14,660 --> 0:04:21,860
 all the voltage difference is actually dissipated in that transistor so it's not very efficient so

38
0:04:21,860 --> 0:04:25,940
 you actually if you would do this on a battery power thing and you have a very big difference

39
0:04:25,940 --> 0:04:31,940
 between your battery voltage and the usable voltage then you waste a lot of power and that

40
0:04:31,940 --> 0:04:36,980
 is of course not uh not good for your better for your battery life so the idea is to always use a

41
0:04:38,100 --> 0:04:43,700
 way to do dcd's conversion with a high high efficiency and well the efficiency should be above

42
0:04:43,700 --> 0:04:53,540
 70 percent or uh in some cases even up 79 to 98 percent uh those are uh well those direct

43
0:04:53,540 --> 0:04:59,940
 c regulators which are capable of doing that on reasonably high power levels um well the most

44
0:04:59,940 --> 0:05:07,300
 common uh conversion you will find in mobile phones and battery powered stuff is buck converters

45
0:05:07,300 --> 0:05:13,380
 and this is basically the cdc converter where you're having an inductor and the capacitor

46
0:05:13,700 --> 0:05:20,100
 the inductor is usually around one to ten micro hundred so it's relatively small and it should

47
0:05:20,100 --> 0:05:27,620
 having uh should have a decent dc carrying capability like a few amps and output capacitor

48
0:05:27,620 --> 0:05:32,100
 is usually a ceramic capacitor because while they're having a low very low esr so a series

49
0:05:32,100 --> 0:05:40,340
 resistance and that's make also makes well it's both a storage and you can also see it as an lc

50
0:05:40,340 --> 0:05:43,220
 filter that filters out all the switching noise because the the the the the the the the the the

51
0:05:43,220 --> 0:05:43,620
 the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the

52
0:05:43,620 --> 0:05:48,180
 the power will be generated by using two switches there's a high side switch and a low side switch

53
0:05:50,180 --> 0:05:52,180
 and while the high side switch is used to actually

54
0:05:53,780 --> 0:05:59,140
 put a jolt of current into the inductor the inductor will get the triangular

55
0:06:02,180 --> 0:06:09,860
 voltage over it and then the v out itself will be will be stable and depends on the duty cycle

56
0:06:09,860 --> 0:06:12,980
 you apply to the top switch there's also a switch here on the bottom

57
0:06:13,620 --> 0:06:18,420
 that's not strictly needed for all converters but you can use that to actually

58
0:06:19,540 --> 0:06:23,300
 make the converter a little bit more efficient because there's a voltage drop over here and

59
0:06:23,300 --> 0:06:29,220
 dissipation and if you use a mosfet here then you have less voltage drop there and while you

60
0:06:29,220 --> 0:06:35,380
 can having a little bit better regulation so for all the high power server scenarios usually it's

61
0:06:36,980 --> 0:06:43,460
 using both switches well this is then a picture from wikipedia about how a lot of the power is

62
0:06:43,620 --> 0:06:50,020
 being produced so it's a big converter works so you see a relatively short on time a relatively

63
0:06:50,020 --> 0:06:57,380
 long off time you see here the input voltage and the voltage over the inductor here it's this yellow

64
0:06:57,380 --> 0:07:02,820
 area which is both positive and negative if you measure it over the inductor and the output voltage

65
0:07:02,820 --> 0:07:09,220
 is relatively constant and that's in continuous mode and if you don't do not have too much load

66
0:07:09,220 --> 0:07:13,540
 then you might be in this continuous mode and then it looks a little bit different and you see it's

67
0:07:13,540 --> 0:07:18,040
 there's no voltage drop over the inductor this all ideal but inductors

68
0:07:18,040 --> 0:07:26,100
 are not ideal but yeah it's just a concept well then if you implement this

69
0:07:26,100 --> 0:07:31,280
 in a chip then you want to achieve put all the semiconductors in one chip then

70
0:07:31,280 --> 0:07:35,740
 so if you put all the transistors and the diode and everything in one chip and

71
0:07:35,740 --> 0:07:38,640
 only have the external components of inductor and capacitor on the output

72
0:07:38,640 --> 0:07:44,400
 then yeah it's relatively simple you can do then use a p-channel a MOSFET on the

73
0:07:44,400 --> 0:07:51,940
 top and you put a negative yeah you have to pull the signal down to turn the

74
0:07:51,940 --> 0:07:57,020
 switch on and it will do that with a certain P with PWM and it will be

75
0:07:57,020 --> 0:08:01,580
 control circuits also integrated in the chip which takes the feedback output and

76
0:08:01,580 --> 0:08:07,800
 then but this is relatively simple and cheap but if you want to make a little

77
0:08:07,800 --> 0:08:08,620
 bit more higher power

78
0:08:08,620 --> 0:08:12,580
 scenario then using n-channel MOSFETs and the reason why you want to use

79
0:08:12,580 --> 0:08:16,240
 n-channel MOSFETs is because well they are relatively they have usually better

80
0:08:16,240 --> 0:08:20,860
 specifications than p-channel MOSFETs for a lower RDS on higher current

81
0:08:20,860 --> 0:08:28,120
 capability and you can also sometimes use them as external components so if

82
0:08:28,120 --> 0:08:32,680
 you have a separate n-channel MOSFETs external to your regulator you can then

83
0:08:32,680 --> 0:08:37,720
 draw much more power because you can optimize control logic to which you just

84
0:08:37,720 --> 0:08:38,580
 be engaged

85
0:08:38,620 --> 0:08:43,460
 and you can also use a p-channel MOSFETs for external MOSFETs and external MOSFETs

86
0:08:43,460 --> 0:08:51,660
 put on the board and even put heat sinks on them to make it even more simple yeah

87
0:08:51,660 --> 0:08:54,960
 but there's then there's a difference because n-channel MOSFETs you need the

88
0:08:54,960 --> 0:08:59,200
 positive voltage to turn them on and that creates a problem on the bottom

89
0:08:59,200 --> 0:09:03,220
 side that's usually not a problem because your VIN is probably higher than

90
0:09:03,220 --> 0:09:06,620
 three volts and three volts is usually you kind of threshold for high power

91
0:09:06,620 --> 0:09:07,620
 MOSFETs

92
0:09:08,620 --> 0:09:14,080
 if this MOSFET needs to be turned on then you also need more than a three

93
0:09:14,080 --> 0:09:18,380
 volts over here but if your input voltage is when this thing is on

94
0:09:18,380 --> 0:09:22,780
 there will be almost no voltage drop between a drain and the source so you

95
0:09:22,780 --> 0:09:27,040
 need gate voltage needs to be above VIN so that's interesting problem and

96
0:09:27,040 --> 0:09:33,580
 well you have to solve the problem somehow well it is and you could do that

97
0:09:33,580 --> 0:09:36,620
 by actually making

98
0:09:36,620 --> 0:09:38,580
 a

99
0:09:38,620 --> 0:09:45,160
 internal using a charge pump or something like that in your chip but although those charge

100
0:09:45,160 --> 0:09:50,060
 pump needs capacitors the capacitors are very expensive in the chip you cannot get more than

101
0:09:50,060 --> 0:09:58,780
 a few picofarads in the chip so or even less so then usually what the chip designers do they give

102
0:09:58,780 --> 0:10:03,740
 you a boost input and then you have to put an external capacitor which is connected to the

103
0:10:03,740 --> 0:10:09,240
 switching node and this you will be basically at a kind of square wave on this node you do

104
0:10:09,240 --> 0:10:14,820
 those things switching initially the gates might be not be very good conducting but as soon as you

105
0:10:14,820 --> 0:10:21,680
 got a few cycles you actually use power to charge them here inside the chip and then your power

106
0:10:21,680 --> 0:10:27,440
 gets more stable and sometimes you can also help that the charge pump by actually providing external

107
0:10:27,440 --> 0:10:33,380
 diode and that's that sometimes very handy so also some power supply manufacturers

108
0:10:33,740 --> 0:10:39,740
 provide application nodes how to do that and that's yeah that's you should really always

109
0:10:39,740 --> 0:10:45,500
 check if there are application nodes for the chip that you you picked because well if you do if you

110
0:10:45,500 --> 0:10:52,140
 forget that there might be some issues if you do not provide the power here quick enough

111
0:10:54,700 --> 0:11:01,260
 well what's more yeah this this is the most important part i think for this part

112
0:11:02,620 --> 0:11:03,580
 oh yeah but you also see

113
0:11:03,740 --> 0:11:07,360
 there's always body diodes inside all MOSFETs.

114
0:11:07,360 --> 0:11:08,800
 I always put them in my schematics

115
0:11:08,800 --> 0:11:12,060
 because it makes a swapping drain

116
0:11:12,060 --> 0:11:13,520
 and source on the MOSFET in the schematic

117
0:11:13,520 --> 0:11:15,700
 is very disastrous, you don't want to do that.

118
0:11:15,700 --> 0:11:17,300
 And it's also a bit more logical

119
0:11:17,300 --> 0:11:19,180
 because if you reverse power anything

120
0:11:19,180 --> 0:11:20,820
 or you have some back EMF,

121
0:11:20,820 --> 0:11:23,560
 well you have to, you can just trace the path

122
0:11:23,560 --> 0:11:25,700
 the current goes.

123
0:11:25,700 --> 0:11:34,100
 Then there's another thing about the feedback loop stability.

124
0:11:34,100 --> 0:11:40,260
 There's a voltage divider usually on the output

125
0:11:40,260 --> 0:11:44,260
 and then, so if you're out to say 3 volts

126
0:11:44,260 --> 0:11:47,260
 or 3.3 volts, then there's a voltage divider

127
0:11:47,260 --> 0:11:50,160
 which well maybe a few hundred kiloamps

128
0:11:50,160 --> 0:11:54,560
 drawing a few microamps or less.

129
0:11:54,560 --> 0:11:55,680
 And then you're having a output

130
0:11:55,680 --> 0:11:58,560
 voltage which is typically around 1.2

131
0:11:58,560 --> 0:12:00,960
 or 0.8 or 0.6 volts or something like that.

132
0:12:00,960 --> 0:12:03,420
 And then there's a feedback input

133
0:12:03,420 --> 0:12:05,160
 on the controller of your power supply

134
0:12:05,160 --> 0:12:07,620
 and there will be comparator which

135
0:12:07,620 --> 0:12:09,500
 compares that output voltage and uses

136
0:12:09,500 --> 0:12:12,560
 that to adjust the PWM rate of both MOSFETs

137
0:12:12,560 --> 0:12:17,060
 just to make sure the

138
0:12:17,060 --> 0:12:19,620
 UXC gain the output voltage.

139
0:12:19,620 --> 0:12:23,460
 There's also some, yeah there's also

140
0:12:23,460 --> 0:12:25,080
 filter response, there's a delay in there

141
0:12:25,080 --> 0:12:25,660
 and then there's a filter response

142
0:12:25,660 --> 0:12:28,660
 which will tell you how to calculate it.

143
0:12:28,660 --> 0:12:30,940
 Usually the data sheet will tell you how to calculate it.

144
0:12:30,940 --> 0:12:33,620
 Well, you have to very carefully always check

145
0:12:33,620 --> 0:12:34,980
 if you're doing that right.

146
0:12:34,980 --> 0:12:40,760
 But might be also some issues with the speed

147
0:12:40,760 --> 0:12:42,640
 of which this feedback loop works.

148
0:12:42,640 --> 0:12:45,380
 Because if you're for example having outputs

149
0:12:45,380 --> 0:12:48,280
 and you put a very quick load step on it,

150
0:12:48,280 --> 0:12:49,720
 well you can for example generate that

151
0:12:49,720 --> 0:12:51,780
 with an electronic load.

152
0:12:52,960 --> 0:12:55,060
 And you actually go from 10% of your current

153
0:12:55,060 --> 0:13:02,440
 to say 90% of your current then there might be some oscillations into the

154
0:13:02,440 --> 0:13:07,720
 control loop which actually eventually crash your power supply and well if you

155
0:13:07,720 --> 0:13:12,220
 just run normal software on it and it seems to work then yeah you think well

156
0:13:12,220 --> 0:13:16,040
 everything is fine yeah well let's just ship it but well it's important to

157
0:13:16,040 --> 0:13:21,160
 actually just do the extra step use an electronic load to do this step

158
0:13:21,160 --> 0:13:27,340
 response from 10% to 90% but also from 90% to 10% because that creates

159
0:13:27,340 --> 0:13:31,180
 additional capacitance and then creates more delay times and well that could

160
0:13:31,180 --> 0:13:39,540
 also cause issues it's a very practical thing very simple to do and and it works

161
0:13:39,540 --> 0:13:44,660
 irrespective of your data sheet so if you bought a component and you see well

162
0:13:44,660 --> 0:13:49,640
 yeah it should work because it's pin compatible and you found the data sheet

163
0:13:49,640 --> 0:13:51,080
 and well everything seems to work

164
0:13:51,080 --> 0:13:51,140
 yeah it should work because it's pin compatible and you found the data sheet

165
0:13:51,140 --> 0:13:57,500
 we've just performed this practical test it's very easy to verify whether you

166
0:13:57,500 --> 0:14:04,620
 actually made the right choice but also there might be issues with the current

167
0:14:04,620 --> 0:14:09,900
 through this feedback resistor there's some data sheets of some regulators they

168
0:14:09,900 --> 0:14:12,900
 also say that you have to add an additional capacitor so you see the

169
0:14:12,900 --> 0:14:17,780
 green capacitor over there and that actually creates actually enhances the

170
0:14:17,780 --> 0:14:21,060
 performance of the output to the feedback

171
0:14:21,060 --> 0:14:26,740
 and so if there's additional capacitance here or some input loads then that's

172
0:14:26,740 --> 0:14:30,820
 capacitor could be only a few hundred picofarads actually improves the

173
0:14:30,820 --> 0:14:37,200
 response of the feedback loop so yeah if you just if you see issues just

174
0:14:37,200 --> 0:14:46,060
 experiment with those capacitor values to see if your step response improves so

175
0:14:46,060 --> 0:14:50,900
 well this is basically all the most important parts

176
0:14:51,060 --> 0:14:59,740
 so it's very roughly simple and the quick thing so these are the all the

177
0:14:59,740 --> 0:15:04,740
 things verified operational operational life for electrical capacitors well

178
0:15:04,740 --> 0:15:11,340
 that's because the if you're a capacitor capacitor dry out they usually the ESR

179
0:15:11,340 --> 0:15:17,740
 actually goes goes up and it means that the capacitor is doing its work less it

180
0:15:17,740 --> 0:15:20,980
 will dissipate more and more power so they get a hotter and hotter and hotter

181
0:15:20,980 --> 0:15:25,060
 they will evaporate directly electrolytes much faster so if you

182
0:15:25,060 --> 0:15:30,740
 have old consumer hardware the easiest way to repair it is just verify reduce

183
0:15:30,740 --> 0:15:42,100
 all of the electric testers verify their impedance using LCR meter and then see

184
0:15:42,100 --> 0:15:45,160
 if that's still within spec and otherwise find other capacitors to

185
0:15:45,160 --> 0:15:50,460
 replace them with what is the load step up and step down so there's 10% to 80

186
0:15:50,460 --> 0:15:50,960
 90%

187
0:15:50,980 --> 0:15:57,220
 of your current yeah and if you have new batches of hardware well you could there

188
0:15:57,220 --> 0:16:04,340
 could be new chips in your thing your hardware supply chain so always just

189
0:16:04,340 --> 0:16:08,100
 check well if you have new new new new new new rule of components coming in

190
0:16:08,100 --> 0:16:16,260
 just verify a hardware and also the power supplies well the driving for

191
0:16:16,260 --> 0:16:19,580
 electronics power source basically what is the bootstrap capacitor story that I

192
0:16:19,580 --> 0:16:20,460
 just told

193
0:16:20,460 --> 0:16:25,800
 the feedback loop that's the small capacitor on the voltage divider yeah

194
0:16:25,800 --> 0:16:31,100
 they're ringing itself that's yeah you can see just what about looks best I

195
0:16:31,100 --> 0:16:36,340
 mean if you go if it goes up and then there's a lot of things ringing before

196
0:16:36,340 --> 0:16:42,640
 it becomes come stable yeah that might be getting problematic if the transient

197
0:16:42,640 --> 0:16:50,300
 becomes even sharper so yeah it's best to just make it fast and smooth oh yeah and the softness of the power supply is also important

198
0:16:50,300 --> 0:16:53,100
 time so if you have a residential product and then you haveoff start function疫al

199
0:16:53,100 --> 0:16:54,100
 update you worked out in this I'm

200
0:16:54,100 --> 0:16:55,700
 and that now you might won't wanna we have a

201
0:16:55,700 --> 0:17:18,140
我就

202
0:17:20,300 --> 0:17:25,160
 so if you just do it in sequence all the power supplies and making sure it's fast

203
0:17:25,160 --> 0:17:32,000
 and reliable that saves a lot of debugging for the electronic part so

204
0:17:32,000 --> 0:17:37,460
 well this is my this all file this was my talk so hopefully well maybe there

205
0:17:37,460 --> 0:17:41,900
 are some questions or other things you can do some more experiments any

206
0:17:41,900 --> 0:17:49,020
 questions no but thank you
