0:00:00,000 --> 0:00:10,600
 Welcome to this talk, where William will teach us how to become an ISP.

2
0:00:13,740 --> 0:00:19,600
 So, welcome. This is a case study into the series of troops riding with cat videos, which is also known as the internet.

3
0:00:20,660 --> 0:00:23,080
 So, who am I, and why are you listening to me?

4
0:00:23,080 --> 0:00:38,540
 I am the former chairman, and I've been in operations for four years at Conet Deco, which is a student-run ISP over in Copenhagen, in Lundby, that provides the internet for all the DTU dorms, and one of the oldest ISPs in Denmark.

5
0:00:39,660 --> 0:00:44,520
 And I'm also, and I was, the Supreme Packet Lord and Switch Commander at the Nubagold dorm.

6
0:00:44,840 --> 0:00:48,640
 I also gave myself that title, because there was no one to tell me I couldn't have that title.

7
0:00:49,020 --> 0:00:52,640
 And then I also got my bachelor's in networks technology.

8
0:00:53,080 --> 0:00:57,340
 And I also got my bachelor's in IT from DTU, which is now called cyber technology.

9
0:00:58,180 --> 0:00:59,820
 So, what is an internet service provider?

10
0:01:00,300 --> 0:01:03,460
 They do other things that just annoy you with their terrible customer support.

11
0:01:03,560 --> 0:01:06,940
 They actually provide a useful service, which is the internet.

12
0:01:08,300 --> 0:01:10,220
 So, quick step. Let's create our own.

13
0:01:10,480 --> 0:01:18,800
 So, what you do, you go on your phone, you turn on a personal hotspot, you have someone pay you five kroners for the network, and that's it.

14
0:01:18,900 --> 0:01:19,800
 You're done. That's your ISP.

15
0:01:21,060 --> 0:01:22,520
 Obviously, there's a bit more to that.

16
0:01:23,080 --> 0:01:25,540
 So, here's basic how simple ISPs work.

17
0:01:25,840 --> 0:01:28,300
 They just share a connection they get from someone else.

18
0:01:29,320 --> 0:01:31,620
 So, ISPs, they come in three different tiers.

19
0:01:32,080 --> 0:01:33,620
 There are tier one ISPs.

20
0:01:33,800 --> 0:01:35,520
 These are big guys.

21
0:01:35,760 --> 0:01:36,800
 Some of them you've heard of.

22
0:01:36,920 --> 0:01:37,900
 Some of them you haven't heard of.

23
0:01:38,400 --> 0:01:39,680
 Then there's tier two ISPs.

24
0:01:39,800 --> 0:01:45,020
 There's things like TDC, Global Connect, formerly Neonet, Hurricane Electric, a whole bunch of companies.

25
0:01:45,020 --> 0:01:52,820
 And then there is tier three ISPs, which is, you know, Feebopu, Fullrate, Bonhacks internet connection.

26
0:01:53,080 --> 0:02:00,640
 And then there's a tier three ISP as well, where, and let's start with tier threes, at least, because these are the simplest ISPs.

27
0:02:00,640 --> 0:02:03,640
 But like humans, they come in many different shapes and sizes.

28
0:02:03,640 --> 0:02:11,640
 What they do is they pay entirely for their internet connection from a tier one or tier two ISP, and what they do is provide the last mile coverage.

29
0:02:11,640 --> 0:02:16,640
 And, as I said, they can come in very different shapes and sizes, put it this way, in scale.

30
0:02:16,640 --> 0:02:22,640
 So, it could be an antenna phoning in your apartment building, which just has a patch panel down in the basement.

31
0:02:23,080 --> 0:02:33,080
 And then make sure to put together a deal with some tier two ISP to get internet to the entire building, or it can be a bit more complex than that.

32
0:02:33,080 --> 0:02:51,080
 So, we are going to take the case where we are Bonhacknet, the newest ISP on the block, and through some sort of sitcom situation, we have ended up having to provide the internet connection for the new Luneideholm Island in Copenhagen, which is being built.

33
0:02:51,080 --> 0:02:52,080
 So, the requirements.

34
0:02:52,080 --> 0:02:53,080
 We need to provide internet.

35
0:02:53,080 --> 0:02:55,080
 We need to provide internet for at least one apartment building.

36
0:02:55,080 --> 0:02:59,080
 We want to scale it up, you know, to more, 49 plus is what we are going to say.

37
0:02:59,080 --> 0:03:04,080
 We also want to comply with the Danish logging regulations because, sadly, we have to do that.

38
0:03:04,080 --> 0:03:08,080
 And we want to prioritize getting this set up as fast as possible.

39
0:03:08,080 --> 0:03:15,080
 So, we are going to have very simple topology here, where what we are going to do is we are going to find some tier two ISP.

40
0:03:15,080 --> 0:03:19,080
 We are probably going to go to Global Connect and say, hey, we are starting an internet provider.

41
0:03:19,080 --> 0:03:20,080
 We want some internet.

42
0:03:20,080 --> 0:03:21,080
 And they will say, great.

43
0:03:21,080 --> 0:03:22,080
 Here is a fiber panel.

44
0:03:22,080 --> 0:03:24,080
 Here is a fiber panel you can connect to.

45
0:03:24,080 --> 0:03:33,080
 We will give you one gig per second of internet connection and we will give you who knows how many IP addresses you ask for.

46
0:03:33,080 --> 0:03:36,080
 And, obviously, we are not going to give us that many IP addresses.

47
0:03:36,080 --> 0:03:39,080
 So, we are going to want to route this into a router with NAT support.

48
0:03:39,080 --> 0:03:41,080
 This is network address translation.

49
0:03:41,080 --> 0:03:45,080
 So, this is where you take the, well, there is the Bonhack NAT network.

50
0:03:45,080 --> 0:03:47,080
 I am pretty sure you all know what NAT is, at least.

51
0:03:47,080 --> 0:03:50,080
 And then we are also going to want a DHCP server to provide, you know, the IP address.

52
0:03:50,080 --> 0:03:52,080
 So, all the people living in apartment buildings.

53
0:03:52,080 --> 0:03:57,080
 And then we are going to want to run cables from our main router, which takes the fiber connection in from the tier two.

54
0:03:57,080 --> 0:04:03,080
 And we want to send that into switches in different apartment buildings so we can send connections to different apartments.

55
0:04:03,080 --> 0:04:04,080
 All done?

56
0:04:04,080 --> 0:04:05,080
 Obviously not.

57
0:04:05,080 --> 0:04:06,080
 There are issues here.

58
0:04:06,080 --> 0:04:08,080
 So, we don't have isolation between the individual apartments.

59
0:04:08,080 --> 0:04:12,080
 Everyone here is in the same broadcast domain, which means all devices could see all of our devices.

60
0:04:12,080 --> 0:04:14,080
 This also doesn't live up to the logging requirements.

61
0:04:14,080 --> 0:04:16,080
 So, we are going to want to run this in a different way.

62
0:04:16,080 --> 0:04:18,080
 So, we are going to run this in a different way.

63
0:04:18,080 --> 0:04:19,080
 So, we are going to run this in a different way.

64
0:04:19,080 --> 0:04:21,080
 This also doesn't live up to the logging requirements.

65
0:04:21,080 --> 0:04:27,080
 And it's really not scalable because we are not going to get a core switch which has more than 48 ports.

66
0:04:27,080 --> 0:04:33,080
 So, here, what we want to add, and, yes, this diagram has issues in it.

67
0:04:33,080 --> 0:04:35,080
 It is the exact same as the one from before.

68
0:04:35,080 --> 0:04:41,080
 What we want to add here is, first of all, we want to add a firewall in between our tier two ISP and our router.

69
0:04:41,080 --> 0:04:49,080
 Generally, we want to get, like, an ISP grade one because this will allow us to get all the logging we need from, to comply with the Danish rules.

70
0:04:49,080 --> 0:04:51,080
 And this is one of the Danish requirements.

71
0:04:51,080 --> 0:04:56,080
 And here, the Danish requirements, they are that we need to log the metadata from connection.

72
0:04:56,080 --> 0:05:01,080
 So, we don't need to be, you know, we don't need to log the actual data that's being transmitted.

73
0:05:01,080 --> 0:05:07,080
 But we need to say this IP address accessed this address, this other IP address at this time.

74
0:05:07,080 --> 0:05:09,080
 And it was this person that was behind it.

75
0:05:09,080 --> 0:05:11,080
 This is what happens when the forwardies come.

76
0:05:11,080 --> 0:05:17,080
 Then what we also want to do is we want to fix this issue with the broadcast domain.

77
0:05:17,080 --> 0:05:20,080
 So, we can do that for lots of different ways.

78
0:05:20,080 --> 0:05:30,080
 But the easiest way is to use what are called VLANs, virtual LANs, where we'll then assign each apartment with its own VLAN, its own virtual LAN.

79
0:05:30,080 --> 0:05:33,080
 And this way, there will be isolation between each apartment.

80
0:05:33,080 --> 0:05:36,080
 And, of course, also, we want to make this scalable.

81
0:05:36,080 --> 0:05:42,080
 So, this would include then we could add more routers in between here.

82
0:05:42,080 --> 0:05:47,080
 So, we have our core router, which will connect to a second layer of routers, which will then connect to the switches in the apartment buildings.

83
0:05:47,080 --> 0:05:51,080
 And then you could have a router for every ten buildings or whatever.

84
0:05:51,080 --> 0:05:55,080
 Next, you know, great, we have a very simple ISP.

85
0:05:55,080 --> 0:06:00,080
 And, honestly, this is not more complex than what some people even are running at home.

86
0:06:00,080 --> 0:06:03,080
 Tier 3 ISPs are simple.

87
0:06:03,080 --> 0:06:06,080
 But Tier 2 ISPs, this is where we get the more interesting stuff.

88
0:06:06,080 --> 0:06:10,080
 This is where we learn a bit more how the Internet is actually structured together.

89
0:06:10,080 --> 0:06:12,080
 They also come in many different shapes and sizes.

90
0:06:12,080 --> 0:06:15,080
 What they do is they can pay for transit from others.

91
0:06:15,080 --> 0:06:16,080
 This is what we were doing before with the other Tier 2 ISPs.

92
0:06:16,080 --> 0:06:19,080
 Where we were paying them for the connection.

93
0:06:19,080 --> 0:06:23,080
 However, they can also engage in peering with other networks.

94
0:06:23,080 --> 0:06:28,080
 And peering is the networking version of sharing is caring.

95
0:06:28,080 --> 0:06:33,080
 So, peering, when two networks love each other very, very much, they celebrate by peering.

96
0:06:33,080 --> 0:06:42,080
 And this occurs and peering involves networks connecting to each other and say, okay, let's freely exchange data with each other.

97
0:06:42,080 --> 0:06:45,080
 You have a data center on your network hosting.

98
0:06:45,080 --> 0:06:47,080
 I don't know, Facebook, let's say.

99
0:06:47,080 --> 0:06:50,080
 And I want to access Facebook for free, so let's set up a peering agreement.

100
0:06:50,080 --> 0:06:57,080
 And most of the time, if we ignore Cognant, because they aren't so nice, most of the time, these peering agreements are free.

101
0:06:57,080 --> 0:07:00,080
 And a lot of time, they're also informal as well to a certain degree.

102
0:07:00,080 --> 0:07:04,080
 It's not big legal contracts I need to get through as well.

103
0:07:04,080 --> 0:07:07,080
 And peering occurs at Internet exchange points.

104
0:07:07,080 --> 0:07:13,080
 These Internet exchange points are the core infrastructure of the Internet.

105
0:07:13,080 --> 0:07:14,080
 So, if peering is consensual in terms of the Internet, then it's not a big deal.

106
0:07:14,080 --> 0:07:16,080
 Peering is consensual interchange packets.

107
0:07:16,080 --> 0:07:20,080
 Then IXPs, Internet exchange points, are the Internet swinger clubs.

108
0:07:20,080 --> 0:07:22,080
 It's where ISPs meet.

109
0:07:22,080 --> 0:07:27,080
 They connect to the IXP.

110
0:07:27,080 --> 0:07:30,080
 And then they'll get a connection in the switch here.

111
0:07:30,080 --> 0:07:37,080
 And then they can go into peering agreements with other ISPs.

112
0:07:37,080 --> 0:07:42,080
 So, peering, as I said before, free, sort of informal process.

113
0:07:42,080 --> 0:07:47,080
 So, if you follow these rules here, then you can peer with us.

114
0:07:47,080 --> 0:07:57,080
 So, Hurricane Electric, for example, which is one of the largest tier two ISPs, they'll say, okay, you only send traffic which we are announcing to us.

115
0:07:57,080 --> 0:08:02,080
 You have to peer with us at all ISPs that you are present in and so on.

116
0:08:02,080 --> 0:08:07,080
 And peering policy, as I said, both parties need to follow them.

117
0:08:07,080 --> 0:08:10,080
 And to put it simply, if you follow these rules here, then you can peer with us.

118
0:08:10,080 --> 0:08:12,080
 Parties need to follow them.

119
0:08:12,080 --> 0:08:17,080
 And to peer, we also need what's called an AS, Autonomous System.

120
0:08:17,080 --> 0:08:19,080
 So, what in the world is an AS?

121
0:08:19,080 --> 0:08:24,080
 It is fancy nerd speak for just having a set of IP addresses.

122
0:08:24,080 --> 0:08:28,080
 So, here at Bonhack, we even have our own AS number, I believe.

123
0:08:28,080 --> 0:08:31,080
 I actually, we do.

124
0:08:31,080 --> 0:08:40,080
 And what this AS is, it's just a way to say, okay, all these different subnets that we have from the IPv4 and IPv6 ranges,

125
0:08:40,080 --> 0:08:43,080
 they belong to these organizations.

126
0:08:43,080 --> 0:08:47,080
 Autonomous systems are assigned by the regional internet registry.

127
0:08:47,080 --> 0:08:49,080
 So, in Europe, it's the RIPE NCC.

128
0:08:49,080 --> 0:08:53,080
 There is ARIN in the U.S.

129
0:08:53,080 --> 0:08:56,080
 And then there's a couple others which I can't remember.

130
0:08:56,080 --> 0:09:01,080
 And generally, they aren't free, but they aren't that expensive either to get.

131
0:09:01,080 --> 0:09:09,080
 And the only requirement to have an AS is really, at least on the public-facing internet, is that you need to have some IP addresses,

132
0:09:09,080 --> 0:09:16,080
 which IPv6 addresses you can get freely pretty easily once you are registered at a regional internet registry.

133
0:09:16,080 --> 0:09:22,080
 And IPv4 addresses, well, they're kind of expensive nowadays because we've run out of them.

134
0:09:22,080 --> 0:09:23,080
 So, how do you peer-to?

135
0:09:23,080 --> 0:09:29,080
 So, first of all, you get a lot of money because you are going to be digging a lot of fiber cables to your nearest IXP.

136
0:09:29,080 --> 0:09:34,080
 You can probably pay to use another internet provider's fiber cables as well.

137
0:09:34,080 --> 0:09:38,080
 But eventually, you are going to need to be able to hook up to the IXP.

138
0:09:38,080 --> 0:09:40,080
 And as I said, they are in certain locations.

139
0:09:40,080 --> 0:09:48,080
 So, here in Copenhagen, for example, here in Denmark, for example, the oldest IXP is in DTU Building 304.

140
0:09:48,080 --> 0:09:55,080
 So, if you were to start an IXP out there where we said in Copenhagen of the new Lund-Niederhall-Meilenwehr building,

141
0:09:55,080 --> 0:10:01,080
 you will need to have a fiber connection from your offices there or from your data center there all the way to the IXP.

142
0:10:01,080 --> 0:10:06,080
 And then, obviously, we add step three, and then we get profit, right?

143
0:10:06,080 --> 0:10:08,080
 Not that simple, obviously.

144
0:10:08,080 --> 0:10:11,080
 Things are never that simple.

145
0:10:11,080 --> 0:10:13,080
 So, for peering, there is a bit more technical.

146
0:10:13,080 --> 0:10:17,080
 Obviously, once we have reached out to a couple of Tier 2 ISPs and they said,

147
0:10:17,080 --> 0:10:19,080
 yeah, let's peer, let's, you know, that would be great.

148
0:10:19,080 --> 0:10:22,080
 We can freely exchange data.

149
0:10:22,080 --> 0:10:24,080
 You need to set up some routing protocols as well.

150
0:10:24,080 --> 0:10:30,080
 And the main ones that are used is OSPF, open shortest path first, which is also what's on my T-shirt,

151
0:10:30,080 --> 0:10:38,080
 is this is an IGP or an interior gateway protocol where this routes within,

152
0:10:38,080 --> 0:10:41,080
 your AS, because obviously when we're getting this point here,

153
0:10:41,080 --> 0:10:46,080
 we've scaled a bit up from the simple having one core router and a couple of switches and a couple of apartment buildings.

154
0:10:46,080 --> 0:10:51,080
 Here, we would generally be having several main locations we are accessing from,

155
0:10:51,080 --> 0:10:53,080
 and we're going to be one of routing around in this as well.

156
0:10:53,080 --> 0:10:55,080
 So, we use the OSPF protocol.

157
0:10:55,080 --> 0:10:57,080
 And this can recover from failed links.

158
0:10:57,080 --> 0:10:59,080
 They could also do traffic engineering.

159
0:10:59,080 --> 0:11:04,080
 And from the name open shortest path first, it takes the shortest path that's available first.

160
0:11:04,080 --> 0:11:06,080
 Next, once we want to route traffic to our T-shirt,

161
0:11:06,080 --> 0:11:09,080
 we use what's called BGP, the border gateway protocol.

162
0:11:09,080 --> 0:11:12,080
 And this is the main protocol behind the internet.

163
0:11:12,080 --> 0:11:15,080
 And by default, it is hilariously insecure.

164
0:11:15,080 --> 0:11:21,080
 And, like, seriously, if you actually set yourself and go really dig into BGP,

165
0:11:21,080 --> 0:11:23,080
 you're wondering how the hell does the internet work.

166
0:11:23,080 --> 0:11:25,080
 It shouldn't work.

167
0:11:25,080 --> 0:11:30,080
 So, here we're going to have a little side rant, which is why BGP is a terrible protocol.

168
0:11:30,080 --> 0:11:31,080
 Brief history.

169
0:11:31,080 --> 0:11:35,080
 As you can see, BGP is a terrible protocol.

170
0:11:35,080 --> 0:11:36,080
 Brief history.

171
0:11:36,080 --> 0:11:43,080
 Originally, on two napkins, back in 19, I want to say, 84,

172
0:11:43,080 --> 0:11:46,080
 but I'm not fully sure about the year,

173
0:11:46,080 --> 0:11:49,080
 on two napkins, they defined the border gateway protocol.

174
0:11:49,080 --> 0:11:52,080
 So, simple protocol at least.

175
0:11:52,080 --> 0:11:54,080
 There are some issues with it, however.

176
0:11:54,080 --> 0:11:58,080
 And I'm not going to go into explaining how the protocol works in general.

177
0:11:58,080 --> 0:12:03,080
 This can be reading for yourself afterwards because it can get a bit complex at times as well.

178
0:12:03,080 --> 0:12:05,080
 But some issues with it are,

179
0:12:05,080 --> 0:12:07,080
 there are bad distance metrics.

180
0:12:07,080 --> 0:12:11,080
 So, how BGP chooses hops, next hops.

181
0:12:11,080 --> 0:12:14,080
 For OSPF, it would choose the shortest path.

182
0:12:14,080 --> 0:12:17,080
 Here, the issue with BGP is it uses AS path.

183
0:12:17,080 --> 0:12:22,080
 So, how many autonomous systems would a packet pass through to get the shortest path?

184
0:12:22,080 --> 0:12:26,080
 The issue is some of these autonomous systems can have huge geographical distances.

185
0:12:26,080 --> 0:12:30,080
 So, if you were to send a packet, if you're in Singapore and were to send a packet to a server in China,

186
0:12:30,080 --> 0:12:33,080
 it could get routed through Los Angeles, which would, you know,

187
0:12:33,080 --> 0:12:34,080
 you're going halfway across the world.

188
0:12:34,080 --> 0:12:36,080
 You're going halfway across the world there and back again

189
0:12:36,080 --> 0:12:40,080
 for something which should not be that distance as well.

190
0:12:40,080 --> 0:12:46,080
 Another issue with it is manual manipulation of this next best hop is also possible.

191
0:12:46,080 --> 0:12:50,080
 And because of this,

192
0:12:50,080 --> 0:12:57,080
 not as friendly ISP would try to discard appearing traffic.

193
0:12:57,080 --> 0:13:00,080
 And this means it would be then sending it on to another AS

194
0:13:00,080 --> 0:13:02,080
 because they want the transit traffic.

195
0:13:02,080 --> 0:13:04,080
 This is the traffic that's generating the money.

196
0:13:04,080 --> 0:13:09,080
 Transit traffic could also then be maliciously routed for financial gain.

197
0:13:09,080 --> 0:13:12,080
 So, they could say, oh, yes, it's maybe one hop,

198
0:13:12,080 --> 0:13:16,080
 but our contract says you pay us for every single hop that we do.

199
0:13:16,080 --> 0:13:20,080
 So, we're going to route it through five hops to earn some more money.

200
0:13:20,080 --> 0:13:26,080
 BGP, by default, also trusts a bit too much as ASs can advertise routes they do not own.

201
0:13:26,080 --> 0:13:28,080
 This is BGP leaks.

202
0:13:28,080 --> 0:13:32,080
 For example, back in 2019, it was a large part of the internet was knocked down.

203
0:13:32,080 --> 0:13:37,080
 This was because Verizon and another small American ISP,

204
0:13:37,080 --> 0:13:40,080
 which were buying their transit from Verizon,

205
0:13:40,080 --> 0:13:43,080
 the small ISP, they were using a BGP optimizer,

206
0:13:43,080 --> 0:13:46,080
 a piece of software to help them optimize their BGP routes.

207
0:13:46,080 --> 0:13:50,080
 And what they happened is they accidentally advertised a whole bunch of routes

208
0:13:50,080 --> 0:13:52,080
 which they didn't have access to.

209
0:13:52,080 --> 0:13:54,080
 So, they said, hey, you can reach Google.

210
0:13:54,080 --> 0:13:56,080
 You can reach CloudFare, all these IP addresses.

211
0:13:56,080 --> 0:13:58,080
 You can reach them at us.

212
0:13:58,080 --> 0:14:00,080
 And then they sent it onwards.

213
0:14:00,080 --> 0:14:02,080
 And BGP is a gossipy protocol.

214
0:14:02,080 --> 0:14:05,080
 So, Verizon, their internet service provider, Verizon should have said,

215
0:14:05,080 --> 0:14:09,080
 hey, you obviously don't own all these IP addresses here.

216
0:14:09,080 --> 0:14:11,080
 Other people do.

217
0:14:11,080 --> 0:14:13,080
 I'm just not going to send it forward.

218
0:14:13,080 --> 0:14:16,080
 But they didn't because either they had configured something wrong

219
0:14:16,080 --> 0:14:20,080
 or they didn't go too much into the postmortem, of course,

220
0:14:20,080 --> 0:14:22,080
 trying to save a bit of face.

221
0:14:22,080 --> 0:14:24,080
 And what happened is large parts of the internet went down

222
0:14:24,080 --> 0:14:28,080
 because suddenly CloudFare, Linenode, and a whole bunch of others

223
0:14:28,080 --> 0:14:31,080
 were routing to this one ISP in Pennsylvania.

224
0:14:31,080 --> 0:14:34,080
 Not the best.

225
0:14:34,080 --> 0:14:39,080
 BGP leaks can also be maliciously made.

226
0:14:39,080 --> 0:14:45,080
 So, it has occurred several times before where countries such as China and Russia,

227
0:14:45,080 --> 0:14:52,080
 they will leak BGP routes, which is saying they'll set falsely advertised routes.

228
0:14:52,080 --> 0:14:57,080
 And when traffic will then maybe quickly happen, sometimes for a long period of time,

229
0:14:57,080 --> 0:15:00,080
 where they'll route traffic through their own ISP.

230
0:15:00,080 --> 0:15:06,080
 Maybe this is just used for data collection or, you know, who knows what it's used for.

231
0:15:06,080 --> 0:15:12,080
 And yeah, this is also just what I just talked about, BGP leaks.

232
0:15:12,080 --> 0:15:14,080
 So, we know a bit about BGP.

233
0:15:14,080 --> 0:15:15,080
 We know how it works.

234
0:15:15,080 --> 0:15:17,080
 We know how to peer as well.

235
0:15:17,080 --> 0:15:18,080
 We go make an agreement.

236
0:15:18,080 --> 0:15:23,080
 We set up our BGP, configure our BGP protocol on our core router to say,

237
0:15:23,080 --> 0:15:26,080
 yes, we want to peer with these ISPs here.

238
0:15:26,080 --> 0:15:27,080
 All good.

239
0:15:27,080 --> 0:15:29,080
 What else can you do as a tier two ISP?

240
0:15:29,080 --> 0:15:31,080
 And this is where there's some fun stuff going on.

241
0:15:31,080 --> 0:15:36,080
 You can get free hardware if you ask Google or CDNs or Netflix or whatever.

242
0:15:36,080 --> 0:15:41,080
 Because they obviously want to get their static content.

243
0:15:41,080 --> 0:15:44,080
 They want it to get as close to the users as possible.

244
0:15:44,080 --> 0:15:49,080
 Because this then they avoid a whole bunch of transit traffic they have to pay for in that.

245
0:15:49,080 --> 0:15:51,080
 And also lower latency.

246
0:15:51,080 --> 0:15:56,080
 So, you can go to Google and say, hey, I want a peer review and I want to get a cash box here.

247
0:15:56,080 --> 0:15:57,080
 And they'll go, great.

248
0:15:57,080 --> 0:15:58,080
 They'll check if you've fulfilled the requirements.

249
0:15:58,080 --> 0:16:02,080
 If they do, they will send you a box that you slot into your data center.

250
0:16:02,080 --> 0:16:05,080
 And then they'll cash static content which becomes popular.

251
0:16:05,080 --> 0:16:08,080
 This could be things like YouTube videos or ads for YouTube videos.

252
0:16:08,080 --> 0:16:13,080
 Which is why ads always seem to load faster than some obscure video you're trying to watch at 3 in the morning.

253
0:16:16,080 --> 0:16:19,080
 You can also register really dumb IPv6 subnets.

254
0:16:19,080 --> 0:16:20,080
 For example, deadbeef.

255
0:16:20,080 --> 0:16:22,080
 That's a valid IPv6 address.

256
0:16:22,080 --> 0:16:24,080
 It's not assigned to anyone.

257
0:16:24,080 --> 0:16:28,080
 There's a whole bunch of heckspeak IPv6 subnets that aren't assigned to anyone.

258
0:16:28,080 --> 0:16:33,080
 You can also cry a lot because maintaining a tier 2 ISP is a lot of work as well.

259
0:16:33,080 --> 0:16:35,080
 It's not too easy.

260
0:16:35,080 --> 0:16:38,080
 And you can also make lots of money because that's what we're all here for.

261
0:16:38,080 --> 0:16:40,080
 Learning to make money in business.

262
0:16:40,080 --> 0:16:43,080
 So, how do you become tier 1 ISP?

263
0:16:43,080 --> 0:16:46,080
 Well, you don't.

264
0:16:46,080 --> 0:16:51,080
 Tier 1 ISPs is literally a cartel of ISPs who say, okay, we'll peer with you guys.

265
0:16:51,080 --> 0:16:53,080
 And we won't peer with anyone else.

266
0:16:53,080 --> 0:16:56,080
 And if someone buys transit off them.

267
0:16:56,080 --> 0:16:59,080
 Then the people we peer with also get access to that route there.

268
0:16:59,080 --> 0:17:00,080
 So, really.

269
0:17:00,080 --> 0:17:02,080
 You really want to know how to become tier 1 ISP.

270
0:17:07,080 --> 0:17:08,080
 So, this part here.

271
0:17:08,080 --> 0:17:10,080
 I didn't have time to make these slides.

272
0:17:10,080 --> 0:17:15,080
 But here's theoretically how you could become a tier 1 ISP.

273
0:17:15,080 --> 0:17:19,080
 First of all, you would not need to peer with any other network to begin with.

274
0:17:19,080 --> 0:17:23,080
 Yet, you would somehow also need to have an internet service.

275
0:17:23,080 --> 0:17:25,080
 Which was so hugely popular.

276
0:17:25,080 --> 0:17:30,080
 That through transit, you would end up costing these tier 1 ISPs lots of money.

277
0:17:30,080 --> 0:17:34,080
 So, say if you were Google.

278
0:17:34,080 --> 0:17:38,080
 And you somehow created, you know, they created a global spanning ISP.

279
0:17:38,080 --> 0:17:40,080
 And they got a lot of customers.

280
0:17:40,080 --> 0:17:43,080
 And they said, okay, you have to pay us now for transit.

281
0:17:43,080 --> 0:17:46,080
 They say to all the tier 1 ISPs, you have to pay us for transit.

282
0:17:46,080 --> 0:17:48,080
 They're not going to be too happy.

283
0:17:48,080 --> 0:17:51,080
 And maybe, just maybe, they would let you into this cartel of tier 1 ISPs.

284
0:17:51,080 --> 0:17:54,080
 But really, that would also mean, you know, you're taking yourself off.

285
0:17:54,080 --> 0:17:56,080
 The internet.

286
0:17:56,080 --> 0:17:58,080
 To get access to the internet.

287
0:17:58,080 --> 0:18:01,080
 It's not really possible to become a tier 1 ISP.

288
0:18:01,080 --> 0:18:04,080
 And generally, this cartel also becomes smaller and smaller.

289
0:18:04,080 --> 0:18:09,080
 Because Layer 3 keeps up buying more of the other.

290
0:18:09,080 --> 0:18:10,080
 Wait, no.

291
0:18:10,080 --> 0:18:12,080
 Lumen Technologies bought Layer 3.

292
0:18:12,080 --> 0:18:15,080
 Where Layer 3 bought someone else.

293
0:18:15,080 --> 0:18:18,080
 And they're basically all just becoming one big monopolistic ISP.

294
0:18:18,080 --> 0:18:22,080
 But however, you can avoid tier 1 ISPs to a certain degree.

295
0:18:22,080 --> 0:18:24,080
 As there are a lot of other ISPs.

296
0:18:24,080 --> 0:18:26,080
 There are some really big tier 2 ISPs.

297
0:18:26,080 --> 0:18:28,080
 Who will peer with lots of people.

298
0:18:28,080 --> 0:18:32,080
 And they can peer with basically every other tier 2 ISP.

299
0:18:32,080 --> 0:18:36,080
 Again, thank you for the talk.

300
0:18:36,080 --> 0:18:38,080
 I know this might have been a bit short.

301
0:18:38,080 --> 0:18:40,080
 I actually have no idea how long it took.

302
0:18:40,080 --> 0:18:42,080
 You can contact me on email.

303
0:18:42,080 --> 0:18:44,080
 On LinkedIn.

304
0:18:44,080 --> 0:18:46,080
 Or you can just find me in the Pyjamas camp.

305
0:18:46,080 --> 0:18:48,080
 With the other people in Pyjamas.

306
0:18:48,080 --> 0:18:50,080
 Or you can find me at the bar if you want to have a chat.

307
0:18:50,080 --> 0:18:52,080
 Yes.

308
0:18:52,080 --> 0:18:54,080
 We got 25 minutes for questions.

309
0:18:54,080 --> 0:18:56,080
 Longer than I expected.

310
0:19:12,080 --> 0:19:14,080
 If you'd rather not answer this question.

311
0:19:14,080 --> 0:19:16,080
 Say that you didn't understand me.

312
0:19:16,080 --> 0:19:23,080
 How does the BornHack tier 3 ISP comply with the logging requirements of Denmark?

313
0:19:24,080 --> 0:19:26,080
 Our director questions the network team.

314
0:19:26,080 --> 0:19:28,080
 Sitting right there.

315
0:19:28,080 --> 0:19:30,080
 Those fancy gentlemen.

316
0:19:30,080 --> 0:19:34,080
 I think the answer could very well be they're not.

317
0:19:34,080 --> 0:19:38,080
 I know there are some ISPs.

318
0:19:38,080 --> 0:19:40,080
 I know some ISPs.

319
0:19:40,080 --> 0:19:42,080
 The one I was chairman of.

320
0:19:42,080 --> 0:19:44,080
 We didn't follow the Danish regulation.

321
0:19:44,080 --> 0:19:46,080
 We followed the EU regulation.

322
0:19:46,080 --> 0:19:48,080
 Because we didn't fully agree with the Danish one.

323
0:19:48,080 --> 0:19:50,080
 It's a long story.

324
0:19:50,080 --> 0:19:52,080
 But in short.

325
0:19:52,080 --> 0:19:54,080
 If there's an upstream network logging already.

326
0:19:54,080 --> 0:19:56,080
 You don't have to log.

327
0:19:56,080 --> 0:19:58,080
 And it has been the policy of logging in the BornHack network.

328
0:19:58,080 --> 0:20:00,080
 Since I've been here from the start.

329
0:20:00,080 --> 0:20:02,080
 2016.

330
0:20:02,080 --> 0:20:04,080
 When we did the first one.

331
0:20:04,080 --> 0:20:06,080
 We are logging as little as possible.

332
0:20:06,080 --> 0:20:08,080
 We are only looking at traffic if we need to debug stuff.

333
0:20:08,080 --> 0:20:10,080
 So in general.

334
0:20:10,080 --> 0:20:12,080
 We are not logging.

335
0:20:12,080 --> 0:20:14,080
 We are logging a little bit.

336
0:20:14,080 --> 0:20:16,080
 Because we are monitoring the network.

337
0:20:16,080 --> 0:20:18,080
 Using LibreNMS.

338
0:20:18,080 --> 0:20:20,080
 And then we are like deleting those as fast as we can.

339
0:20:20,080 --> 0:20:22,080
 When we get home.

340
0:20:22,080 --> 0:20:24,080
 As little as possible.

341
0:20:34,080 --> 0:20:36,080
 I want to just add.

342
0:20:36,080 --> 0:20:38,080
 That there's also not any logging happening.

343
0:20:38,080 --> 0:20:40,080
 Of the BornHack connection at the upstream.

344
0:20:40,080 --> 0:20:42,080
 And.

345
0:20:44,080 --> 0:20:46,080
 We have a little bit of sflow in between.

346
0:20:46,080 --> 0:20:48,080
 That gets actually logged.

347
0:20:48,080 --> 0:20:50,080
 But it's not a big deal.

348
0:20:50,080 --> 0:20:52,080
 I created.

349
0:20:52,080 --> 0:20:54,080
 But.

350
0:20:54,080 --> 0:20:56,080
 That is only transient.

351
0:20:56,080 --> 0:20:58,080
 And not stored.

352
0:20:58,080 --> 0:21:00,080
 And then in addition.

353
0:21:00,080 --> 0:21:02,080
 If anyone has an AS number.

354
0:21:02,080 --> 0:21:04,080
 And some address space.

355
0:21:04,080 --> 0:21:06,080
 And wants to announce it.

356
0:21:06,080 --> 0:21:08,080
 Here.

357
0:21:08,080 --> 0:21:10,080
 We can probably figure that out.

358
0:21:10,080 --> 0:21:12,080
 Come talk to me.

359
0:21:16,080 --> 0:21:18,080
 Any more questions?

360
0:21:18,080 --> 0:21:20,080
 20 minutes left.

361
0:21:20,080 --> 0:21:22,080
 Otherwise we can go to the bar.

362
0:21:22,080 --> 0:21:24,080
 And have questions.

363
0:21:24,080 --> 0:21:26,080
 And beer.

364
0:21:26,080 --> 0:21:28,080
 Thank you very much for the talk.
