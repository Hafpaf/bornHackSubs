0:00:00,000 --> 0:00:15,740
 Hello and welcome to this talk where Henrik Kramselund will talk about how to get started

2
0:00:15,740 --> 0:00:17,180
 with networking and security.

3
0:00:18,260 --> 0:00:19,480
 Yes, thank you very much.

4
0:00:20,260 --> 0:00:26,860
 I have prepared this slideshow which is in a PDF and the PDF is available on the internet.

5
0:00:26,860 --> 0:00:33,420
 If you go to GitHub, I have an account called Kramse and in that account there are a couple

6
0:00:33,420 --> 0:00:37,160
 of pinned repositories like the one called Security Courses.

7
0:00:37,700 --> 0:00:42,120
 If you go to the one called Security Courses and Presentations, MISC, Getting Started in

8
0:00:42,120 --> 0:00:43,660
 InfoSec, you can get the PDF.

9
0:00:44,560 --> 0:00:50,560
 Those PDFs and all the data in that repository is open source so you can remix it, reuse

10
0:00:50,560 --> 0:00:55,960
 it, take it apart, use the parts that you like, feel inspired by it perhaps.

11
0:00:55,960 --> 0:00:56,060
 Yes.

12
0:00:56,200 --> 0:00:56,420
 Yes.

13
0:00:56,420 --> 0:00:56,480
 Yes.

14
0:00:56,480 --> 0:00:56,540
 Yes.

15
0:00:56,540 --> 0:00:56,600
 Yes.

16
0:00:56,600 --> 0:00:56,660
 Yes.

17
0:00:56,860 --> 0:00:58,780
 Almost do whatever you like.

18
0:01:01,400 --> 0:01:08,800
 Going back to the slideshow, this PDF is linked with a lot of links to other pages and some

19
0:01:08,800 --> 0:01:16,160
 of them I might have time to go to but otherwise you can download the PDF of course and then

20
0:01:16,160 --> 0:01:19,000
 look at all the links afterwards.

21
0:01:20,700 --> 0:01:25,600
 My name is Henrik Kramselund-Jaminsen and I'm a security consultant, internet samurai.

22
0:01:25,600 --> 0:01:26,760
 I have my own.

23
0:01:26,760 --> 0:01:28,100
 I have my own company called Sencurity.

24
0:01:28,100 --> 0:01:37,220
 I also work as a teacher at Copenhagen Academy where I teach in diploma in IT security and

25
0:01:37,220 --> 0:01:42,060
 a lot of this is inspired by this but I have also been teaching a lot over the years.

26
0:01:42,640 --> 0:01:48,300
 I'm an independent network security consultant and the network and security parts is what

27
0:01:48,300 --> 0:01:49,680
 I'm going to talk about today.

28
0:01:50,420 --> 0:01:53,140
 I typically do three things in my company.

29
0:01:53,680 --> 0:01:54,800
 I build networks.

30
0:01:54,800 --> 0:01:56,640
 I really love to install.

31
0:01:56,760 --> 0:01:57,760
 I like to build networks.

32
0:01:57,760 --> 0:01:58,760
 I also like to audit networks, penetration test networks, do active testing of networks.

33
0:01:58,760 --> 0:02:03,760
 I've been part of NOC previously but I'm not really doing much anymore in NOC but I've been

34
0:02:03,760 --> 0:02:08,440
 doing some workshops and talk this born hack but I like to build networks.

35
0:02:08,440 --> 0:02:14,200
 I also like to audit networks, penetration test networks, do active testing of networks.

36
0:02:14,200 --> 0:02:19,480
 We did an active test with some DDoS traffic the other day which perhaps made a bit of

37
0:02:19,480 --> 0:02:24,300
 the network unstable here which was a good test because we got some results and we can

38
0:02:24,300 --> 0:02:26,260
 work from that and improve things next time.

39
0:02:26,260 --> 0:02:31,060
 So that's what I really like about testing networks, you can find the problems and then

40
0:02:31,060 --> 0:02:36,760
 you can try to remove them, decrease the risk of this happening in real life production.

41
0:02:36,760 --> 0:02:41,060
 And then I do teaching of network and security and auditing and pen testing and building

42
0:02:41,060 --> 0:02:45,860
 networks and that is where this talk originates from.

43
0:02:45,860 --> 0:02:46,860
 I have an email address.

44
0:02:46,860 --> 0:02:47,860
 I have a mobile phone.

45
0:02:47,860 --> 0:02:48,860
 You can find me at camp.

46
0:02:48,860 --> 0:02:55,260
 I've been in 019 for this week and I will stay on a couple of days after the event finishes.

47
0:02:56,260 --> 0:03:02,140
 The goal for today is to talk about how to get a plan if you want to get started in

48
0:03:02,140 --> 0:03:03,940
 network and security.

49
0:03:03,940 --> 0:03:07,820
 So you can see that there's a lot of fun stuff going on.

50
0:03:07,820 --> 0:03:08,820
 There's a lot of...

51
0:03:08,820 --> 0:03:09,820
 What?

52
0:03:09,820 --> 0:03:10,820
 It's blinking.

53
0:03:10,820 --> 0:03:11,820
 It's blinking.

54
0:03:11,820 --> 0:03:13,260
 I will try to continue nice and easy and you will try to fix the technical issues.

55
0:03:13,260 --> 0:03:14,260
 Thank you.

56
0:03:14,260 --> 0:03:15,260
 Thank you.

57
0:03:15,260 --> 0:03:16,260
 Thank you.

58
0:03:16,260 --> 0:03:17,260
 Thank you.

59
0:03:17,260 --> 0:03:18,260
 Thank you.

60
0:03:18,260 --> 0:03:19,260
 Thank you.

61
0:03:19,260 --> 0:03:20,260
 Thank you.

62
0:03:20,260 --> 0:03:21,260
 Thank you.

63
0:03:21,260 --> 0:03:22,260
 Thank you.

64
0:03:22,260 --> 0:03:23,260
 Thank you.

65
0:03:23,260 --> 0:03:24,260
 Thank you.

66
0:03:24,260 --> 0:03:25,260
 Thank you.

67
0:03:25,260 --> 0:03:26,260
 Bye.

68
0:03:26,260 --> 0:03:27,260
 Bye.

69
0:03:27,260 --> 0:03:28,260
 Bye.

70
0:03:28,260 --> 0:03:29,260
 Bye.

71
0:03:29,260 --> 0:03:30,260
 Bye.

72
0:03:30,260 --> 0:03:31,720
 So you see all of this funny stuff going on in network and security.

73
0:03:31,720 --> 0:03:37,060
 You might want to have a job, you're interested in this but it's a huge wall of information.

74
0:03:37,060 --> 0:03:42,780
 It's really hard to break into in networking and security because there's just too much

75
0:03:42,780 --> 0:03:44,380
 to learn.

76
0:03:44,380 --> 0:03:49,200
 And some of the things that you want to learn, some of the things you read about are actually

77
0:03:49,200 --> 0:03:54,260
 very advanced stuff that requires you to know something else, which again requires you to

78
0:03:54,260 --> 0:03:55,260
 know something else before you can even get started.

79
0:03:55,260 --> 0:03:55,840
 Thank you.

80
0:03:56,260 --> 0:04:01,900
 understanding the issues. So my goal for today is to point you towards some

81
0:04:01,900 --> 0:04:06,200
 resources so you can get started. I will have some resources that are open source,

82
0:04:06,200 --> 0:04:11,020
 some are my own, so you can get started and create a plan for you to learn

83
0:04:11,020 --> 0:04:16,020
 network and security without drowning, without being overwhelmed by all of this

84
0:04:16,020 --> 0:04:20,560
 information. So I will try to list a few core concepts that I think you should

85
0:04:20,560 --> 0:04:26,020
 know and learn. They are a bit generic so you can reuse them across the board and

86
0:04:26,020 --> 0:04:31,180
 I try to actually use these core concepts in my teaching, in my practical

87
0:04:31,180 --> 0:04:35,340
 exercises, because if you then have another course with me, it will be the

88
0:04:35,340 --> 0:04:40,640
 same. So if I have the diploma in IT security and I teach five courses over

89
0:04:40,640 --> 0:04:45,820
 the year 2021, the people that are coming to the next course will already be more

90
0:04:45,820 --> 0:04:49,740
 prepared and will actually be able to understand far more advanced concepts

91
0:04:49,740 --> 0:04:54,160
 the further they get. So I will try to list a few core concepts that I think

92
0:04:54,160 --> 0:04:56,000
 are useful, some stuff that you can learn about, some stuff that you can learn about,

93
0:04:56,000 --> 0:05:00,980
 you can immediately use for perhaps getting a job. You will know enough that

94
0:05:00,980 --> 0:05:05,660
 you will have some experience and you can use those as tools also if you get a

95
0:05:05,660 --> 0:05:09,860
 job and you have the opportunity to choose tools and add something, you

96
0:05:09,860 --> 0:05:13,700
 already will have some practical knowledge of a few core concepts that

97
0:05:13,700 --> 0:05:19,260
 can be used that are useful, not just for learning but also for production use.

98
0:05:19,260 --> 0:05:24,620
 When I look at network and security, I also look at the security engineering as

99
0:05:24,620 --> 0:05:25,800
 a job role.

100
0:05:26,000 --> 0:05:30,560
 which is one of the roles that I have had in my career as an IT consultant.

101
0:05:31,100 --> 0:05:36,080
 I have been working as a security engineer, and that's a very common role to have.

102
0:05:36,560 --> 0:05:41,780
 And I'm not going to read all of this list of things that you may have in that role,

103
0:05:41,780 --> 0:05:47,500
 but there's a lot of things that you need to do in your daily work if you're a security engineer.

104
0:05:48,420 --> 0:05:52,660
 So being prepared to do all of these things require a lot of work,

105
0:05:52,660 --> 0:05:56,880
 and that is kind of a wall of text of things that you need to be able to do.

106
0:05:57,180 --> 0:05:58,460
 But where to get started?

107
0:05:59,520 --> 0:06:06,300
 To get started, I would recommend that you find a good structured body of knowledge,

108
0:06:06,580 --> 0:06:09,000
 like the ISC2, Common Body of Knowledge.

109
0:06:09,000 --> 0:06:11,300
 It's something that has existed for many years.

110
0:06:11,760 --> 0:06:16,580
 It has been changed over the years, but it's a collection of topics.

111
0:06:17,240 --> 0:06:22,160
 So having a collection of topics will provide kind of an overview of the area

112
0:06:22,160 --> 0:06:22,640
 of the IT industry.

113
0:06:22,660 --> 0:06:30,600
 The ISC2 organization has the CISSP certification, and I have taken that one

114
0:06:30,600 --> 0:06:35,160
 and going through all of the 10 domains at that time, and now the eight domains

115
0:06:35,160 --> 0:06:38,560
 will allow you to learn them each by themselves.

116
0:06:38,960 --> 0:06:41,340
 You might already know parts of some of these.

117
0:06:41,620 --> 0:06:46,560
 If you know parts of some of these, it would make more sense perhaps to expand that knowledge

118
0:06:46,560 --> 0:06:50,320
 and get to be an expert in one of these domains.

119
0:06:50,320 --> 0:06:52,340
 But if you want to take the certification,

120
0:06:52,660 --> 0:06:57,780
 or if you want to fulfill the role of a security engineer, you might be required to know about

121
0:06:57,780 --> 0:07:02,020
 each and every one of these, but it doesn't make sense to read about all of these at the

122
0:07:02,020 --> 0:07:03,380
 same time.

123
0:07:03,380 --> 0:07:09,140
 So again, you can use this to create a plan for which ideas and areas that you want to

124
0:07:09,140 --> 0:07:10,600
 look at.

125
0:07:10,600 --> 0:07:15,560
 And then when you have all of these domains and you have a structured body of knowledge,

126
0:07:15,560 --> 0:07:22,560
 it will also be easier to see new tools, new exploits, new networking concepts, new papers,

127
0:07:22,660 --> 0:07:23,660
 articles.

128
0:07:23,660 --> 0:07:30,040
 The things that you read about will often fit into these structured domains of knowledge.

129
0:07:30,040 --> 0:07:36,640
 So it will be easier for you to decide, is this a thing that I would look into, something

130
0:07:36,640 --> 0:07:40,260
 I need to look into, something I'm expected to look into?

131
0:07:40,260 --> 0:07:44,960
 For instance, when some of these CPU-related vulnerabilities came out a few years back,

132
0:07:44,960 --> 0:07:50,220
 Meltdown and Spectra, those are really advanced concepts, and they are not for everyone to

133
0:07:50,220 --> 0:07:51,520
 read about.

134
0:07:51,520 --> 0:07:52,480
 But you should know where to look.

135
0:07:52,480 --> 0:07:55,480
 You should know where they fit into the overall models.

136
0:07:55,480 --> 0:08:01,020
 So I think it's a good idea to start with some of these structured bodies of knowledge.

137
0:08:01,020 --> 0:08:03,200
 If you want to use this one, that's fine.

138
0:08:03,200 --> 0:08:08,240
 That is the one that I was following to make sure that I fulfilled all the parts of the

139
0:08:08,240 --> 0:08:10,840
 certification, CISSP.

140
0:08:10,840 --> 0:08:16,220
 And I would not recommend that you take any CISSP immediately if you're new to network

141
0:08:16,220 --> 0:08:21,480
 and security, but you may decide that you would go in that direction.

142
0:08:21,480 --> 0:08:31,140
 And it does cover kind of all of security, all of security fits into that overall structure.

143
0:08:31,140 --> 0:08:36,560
 Then you might want to get more practical and getting into a job role, getting a job,

144
0:08:36,560 --> 0:08:41,320
 working in security and networking might require you to have a certification.

145
0:08:41,320 --> 0:08:46,540
 If you don't have any experience and you want to get started in this area, one of the ways

146
0:08:46,540 --> 0:08:49,480
 into a job role would be through a certification.

147
0:08:49,480 --> 0:08:50,480
 There's lots of smaller certifications.

148
0:08:50,480 --> 0:08:51,480
 There's lots of smaller certifications.

149
0:08:51,480 --> 0:08:55,300
 There's security and network certifications.

150
0:08:55,300 --> 0:08:57,340
 There's security plus.

151
0:08:57,340 --> 0:08:59,140
 There's a lot of smaller ones.

152
0:08:59,140 --> 0:09:05,660
 Also from what are called, it doesn't matter.

153
0:09:05,660 --> 0:09:09,980
 There's lots of security certifications and network certifications.

154
0:09:09,980 --> 0:09:14,620
 All the bigger companies, the vendors typically will have an entry level.

155
0:09:14,620 --> 0:09:20,000
 In Juniper they call it associate level entry, entry level certification that will get you

156
0:09:20,000 --> 0:09:21,480
 started on the track.

157
0:09:21,480 --> 0:09:29,600
 And you might know that Cisco, you can get a CCNA and you can get all of the certifications

158
0:09:29,600 --> 0:09:35,300
 all the way to a CCIE, Cisco certified engineer and so on.

159
0:09:35,300 --> 0:09:40,200
 Those are the ones that require you to spend hundreds and thousands of Danish kroner to

160
0:09:40,200 --> 0:09:41,920
 get those certifications.

161
0:09:41,920 --> 0:09:46,960
 It will take you lots of years and experience, but all of these will begin with some kind

162
0:09:46,960 --> 0:09:49,360
 of entry level certification.

163
0:09:49,360 --> 0:09:50,400
 Again.

164
0:09:50,400 --> 0:09:51,400
 Again.

165
0:09:51,400 --> 0:09:54,400
 You will have some kind of certification certification at the beginning of the training piece.

166
0:09:54,400 --> 0:09:59,340
 And if we go to the training link, I'm not going to go to it now, but in this Juniper

167
0:09:59,340 --> 0:10:05,320
 certification, they will have a list of the requirements for each certification.

168
0:10:05,320 --> 0:10:11,240
 So again, that will provide a roadmap for the parts that you will need to know to take

169
0:10:11,240 --> 0:10:12,780
 that specific certification.

170
0:10:12,780 --> 0:10:16,360
 And then you can start to work through those requirements.

171
0:10:16,360 --> 0:10:20,520
 A good idea is perhaps to look at some of these requirements before you try scouting

172
0:10:20,520 --> 0:10:25,340
 maybe the certification won't happen before you have somebody that can sponsor the certification

173
0:10:25,340 --> 0:10:31,800
 attempt but it might be a good idea for yourself to have this list of requirements and decide oh

174
0:10:31,800 --> 0:10:38,040
 i'm going to look at one of these two of these each week and then after perhaps a year you would

175
0:10:38,040 --> 0:10:42,900
 have gone through all of these and would perhaps be ready for certification and you might find be

176
0:10:42,900 --> 0:10:48,040
 able to find a sponsor or at least when you go to like a job interview you would be able to say that

177
0:10:48,040 --> 0:10:52,600
 i have worked through all of this material and i feel confident that i know enough about these

178
0:10:52,600 --> 0:10:59,080
 and i have done some practical exercises at home too so that is again another way to look at the

179
0:10:59,080 --> 0:11:07,520
 structured bodies of knowledge these are of course very vendor specific some of these are also across

180
0:11:07,520 --> 0:11:13,520
 architectures so you will see a lot of cloud in a lot of certifications now because cloud has become

181
0:11:13,520 --> 0:11:17,480
 very popular these years

182
0:11:17,480 --> 0:11:18,020
 even

183
0:11:18,020 --> 0:11:21,620
 though a lot of cloud is actually just moving the same stuff that we have in the enterprises

184
0:11:21,620 --> 0:11:28,580
 into the cloud i have taken some of the juniper certifications i really enjoyed it they are in

185
0:11:28,580 --> 0:11:35,040
 different tracks so in some cases you would also need to decide if you want to work in the cloud or

186
0:11:35,040 --> 0:11:39,540
 you want to work in enterprise routing and switching and there's also a security track

187
0:11:39,540 --> 0:11:45,700
 so if you want to use specifically security products firewalls and those parts of the

188
0:11:45,700 --> 0:11:47,960
 juniper products or the cisco products or the other

189
0:11:48,020 --> 0:11:54,380
 vendors products you can decide to follow that specific track but in general if you want to get

190
0:11:54,380 --> 0:11:58,780
 started in networking security you want to take some of the entry level you want to look at the

191
0:11:58,780 --> 0:12:04,080
 entry level requirements and that can provide a roadmap for which parts to look at

192
0:12:04,080 --> 0:12:13,300
 the next part is something that i'm trying to to understand i'm trying to get better at this

193
0:12:13,300 --> 0:12:17,940
 i'm going to be required to do a lot of teaching over the next years

194
0:12:18,020 --> 0:12:24,240
 i actually have a full-time job from the one first of september at kia i'm going to be teaching

195
0:12:24,240 --> 0:12:32,000
 a bit more than i do now and it's really difficult to teach because we all learn at different levels

196
0:12:32,000 --> 0:12:38,500
 all of you in here probably have different backgrounds so trying to explain a concept

197
0:12:38,500 --> 0:12:46,880
 a tool an area to this group is kind of difficult so what i would like to do and what i propose

198
0:12:46,880 --> 0:12:48,000
 is that we are going to be teaching a lot of technology and we are going to be teaching a lot of

199
0:12:48,020 --> 0:12:53,720
 technology and we look at the skills that we want to learn as different levels and for a lot of us

200
0:12:53,720 --> 0:12:59,720
 hackers on a hacker camp like this we are quite practical so i have decided in some of my courses

201
0:12:59,720 --> 0:13:05,640
 and some of the workshops i have done here not to spend a lot of time on the theoretical parts

202
0:13:05,640 --> 0:13:09,760
 not digging down into going through all the options and levels and everything

203
0:13:09,760 --> 0:13:18,000
 this screenshot shows a tool called nmap the nmap tool has lots and lots of options and

204
0:13:18,020 --> 0:13:23,920
 things you can activate and do and scripting built in if i were to go through all of nmap's

205
0:13:23,920 --> 0:13:30,260
 options before you ran a single nmap command you would get bored you would feel tired you would

206
0:13:30,260 --> 0:13:37,180
 not be happy but if we try to do it immediately try running a program even though we don't know

207
0:13:37,180 --> 0:13:42,860
 what's going on we know that we can run the tool and we can get some data and then we can try to

208
0:13:42,860 --> 0:13:48,000
 understand parts of this data and as we get more interested and we might see the values that we can

209
0:13:48,020 --> 0:13:54,160
 use in the tool we can start to dig into how to run the tool better faster how to get even more

210
0:13:54,160 --> 0:14:01,280
 information how to redirect the tool so we can expand our coverage with the tool and the data

211
0:14:01,280 --> 0:14:06,100
 that we get out of the tool so we get more confident that we have done even more with the

212
0:14:06,100 --> 0:14:12,680
 tool in this case it's an nmap port scanner that can look for ports on a network and that is actually

213
0:14:12,680 --> 0:14:17,380
 one of the most important part of network and security because behind all of these ports is

214
0:14:17,380 --> 0:14:18,000
 going to be software and security and that is actually one of the most important part of network

215
0:14:18,020 --> 0:14:23,960
 and software and software is crap especially software that i write is crap every line of code

216
0:14:23,960 --> 0:14:32,380
 is a risk of doing a security problem for the user for the system for the network so having less

217
0:14:32,380 --> 0:14:39,780
 software exposed is a good thing so by learning nmap you will be able to actually provide some

218
0:14:39,780 --> 0:14:47,180
 value to a network immediately and you are welcome to scan my services you can scan my web servers

219
0:14:47,180 --> 0:14:48,000
 you can scan from them and you can scan from my web servers and you can scan from my web servers

220
0:14:48,000 --> 0:14:52,840
 this network if you scan from this network and you scan somebody that you're not allowed to i will

221
0:14:52,840 --> 0:14:58,780
 get some abuse mails next week and i do not recommend scanning people at random but i do

222
0:14:58,780 --> 0:15:05,980
 recommend you scan your own networks so we may decide that we want to learn nmap so we're going

223
0:15:05,980 --> 0:15:11,840
 to use that as an example now nmap is a very famous port scanner there are multiple books

224
0:15:11,840 --> 0:15:17,980
 available for this tool and you want to learn this to learn it i have done this for a long time

225
0:15:18,000 --> 0:15:18,020
 and i have done this for a long time and i have done this for a long time and i have done this for a long time

226
0:15:18,020 --> 0:15:24,640
 knowledge level skills level competence level trying to cut up learning nmap into different

227
0:15:24,640 --> 0:15:32,340
 parts so at the knowledge level you want to know what is a port scanner why why what is that nmap

228
0:15:32,340 --> 0:15:36,700
 i've heard the name i've seen the matrix movie where the screenshot was from what is a port

229
0:15:36,700 --> 0:15:42,540
 scanner to be able to understand that and answer that question you might need to know some tcp ip

230
0:15:42,540 --> 0:15:47,980
 you need to know what an ip address is so before you look at nmap you may want to look at the port

231
0:15:48,000 --> 0:15:54,240
 and look at tcp and ip and ip addresses first you may want to look at ports and services which are

232
0:15:54,240 --> 0:16:00,960
 for instance http port 80 which is for web servers and you probably have some web servers around

233
0:16:00,960 --> 0:16:06,320
 you have some web servers on some of the devices that you have you probably have a network at home

234
0:16:06,320 --> 0:16:11,360
 you have a network at school and the organizations that you visit when you go to bornhack there's

235
0:16:11,360 --> 0:16:17,520
 a network so you can start working with networks when you know some of the key elements of a network

236
0:16:17,520 --> 0:16:18,000
 you can

237
0:16:18,000 --> 0:16:23,760
 answer what is a port scanner. That is a tool that scans the network, lists the

238
0:16:23,760 --> 0:16:28,320
 ports and services so you can attack them. And if you find open services and

239
0:16:28,320 --> 0:16:33,840
 ports you can remove those. So that's what a port scanner is on the knowledge

240
0:16:33,840 --> 0:16:38,700
 level. The next level might be that you want to run this port scanner. You want

241
0:16:38,700 --> 0:16:43,760
 to be able to be the person that presses enter on the system like in the Matrix

242
0:16:43,760 --> 0:16:48,800
 movie, find an interesting system and do something with it. To be able to run a

243
0:16:48,800 --> 0:16:53,360
 port scanner you will need to have an operating system. Some tools require you

244
0:16:53,360 --> 0:16:58,520
 to have a specific operating system. For instance Nmap runs on Linux. It ran

245
0:16:58,520 --> 0:17:03,260
 originally on Linux only. So in the old days you would have to have a Linux

246
0:17:03,260 --> 0:17:07,920
 computer. Today we are a little bit more lucky because we can get Nmap, the

247
0:17:07,920 --> 0:17:12,720
 package for Mac, Windows, Linux and a lot of other operating systems. So we are

248
0:17:12,720 --> 0:17:13,720
 more free for this.

249
0:17:13,760 --> 0:17:19,400
 This specific tool to choose whatever we like. And I actually often recommend

250
0:17:19,400 --> 0:17:24,120
 installing Nmap on your normal machine. But typically I would also recommend to

251
0:17:24,120 --> 0:17:28,980
 go directly to a virtual machine with Kali Linux. So now I'm introducing a

252
0:17:28,980 --> 0:17:34,520
 large, huge, complex operating system called Kali Linux which you might not be

253
0:17:34,520 --> 0:17:39,740
 familiar with. But I would consider that a requirement for running the port

254
0:17:39,740 --> 0:17:43,680
 scanner Nmap because I know it runs better

255
0:17:43,680 --> 0:17:51,180
 on Kali Linux. It's best on Linux. It's fastest on Linux. I can run all the parts

256
0:17:51,180 --> 0:17:57,440
 on Linux. So Kali Linux would be an excellent driver, motor for running Nmap.

257
0:17:57,440 --> 0:18:01,500
 But then you need to run no Kali Linux. So you would need to know something

258
0:18:01,500 --> 0:18:07,820
 about Linux if you don't know Linux ahead. All of these things will provide

259
0:18:07,820 --> 0:18:13,600
 some paths that you need to select. You need to select which parts to look at when. And

260
0:18:13,600 --> 0:18:19,700
 some of you might want to jump directly to running Nmap on Windows, which is fine.

261
0:18:19,700 --> 0:18:25,000
 But later on, you would probably have to run Kali Linux anyway because some other tools

262
0:18:25,000 --> 0:18:30,720
 would require you to run Kali Linux. But you may have to decide for yourself in which direction

263
0:18:30,720 --> 0:18:37,020
 to go. And you should probably not select a very advanced tool to begin learning network

264
0:18:37,020 --> 0:18:43,160
 and security. And Nmap is one of the ones that you can get started pretty easily. And

265
0:18:43,160 --> 0:18:49,440
 it will provide a lot of value. Then, when you have understood what a port scanner is,

266
0:18:49,440 --> 0:18:54,200
 what it does on the network, you have found a way to run it, you may have found some of

267
0:18:54,200 --> 0:18:58,560
 the options, you have looked at some of the options, then comes the next problem of how

268
0:18:58,560 --> 0:19:05,480
 to run a quality port scan of an enterprise. So that's a complete, that may be the goal

269
0:19:05,480 --> 0:19:09,520
 that you wanted in the first place. You wanted to provide a port scan of a full enterprise,

270
0:19:09,520 --> 0:19:13,160
 a full network and organization. For instance, you wanted to scan all of

271
0:19:13,160 --> 0:19:18,180
 Born Hack, making sure that you have closed all the ports that you can, only the relevant

272
0:19:18,180 --> 0:19:23,480
 ports are open, that's really a hard task. That's not something you can do immediately.

273
0:19:23,480 --> 0:19:28,720
 That requires you to have a plan for scanning, know which scan functions to use. And that

274
0:19:28,720 --> 0:19:34,160
 will require you to invest more time. But you can actually get started pretty quickly

275
0:19:34,160 --> 0:19:40,680
 with this one. But I think it's interesting to note down the requirements before you try

276
0:19:40,680 --> 0:19:42,360
 running the tool.

277
0:19:42,360 --> 0:19:43,140
 . And if you try to teach tools that are more

278
0:19:43,140 --> 0:19:49,500
 tools for others. Maybe you should make it more evident what is required before they can run the

279
0:19:49,500 --> 0:19:54,280
 tool. I try to write in my description for my workshops that you should know what an IP address

280
0:19:54,280 --> 0:19:59,500
 is before coming to an NMAP pen test workshop. Because if you don't know what an IP address is,

281
0:19:59,920 --> 0:20:05,080
 it doesn't really make sense to start running some command with a magical number dot number dot

282
0:20:05,080 --> 0:20:10,900
 number something. So you need to know something before you get started. If you specifically want

283
0:20:10,900 --> 0:20:15,740
 to learn NMAP, I have a four-hour course with NMAP as the subject. There's an exercise booklet

284
0:20:15,740 --> 0:20:21,540
 on my GitHub. You're welcome to use that. And that will actually bring you from almost zero and then

285
0:20:21,540 --> 0:20:27,000
 into being able to do something like a quality port scan of your home network and then maybe a

286
0:20:27,000 --> 0:20:31,700
 medium-sized network. And with some experience, you would be able to attain the goal of running

287
0:20:31,700 --> 0:20:39,560
 a quality port scan of an enterprise. Also, another way to structure all of this, because now we

288
0:20:39,560 --> 0:20:40,900
 introduced some things like

289
0:20:40,900 --> 0:20:45,600
 IP addresses and port numbers, you can look at the technologies that you want to learn.

290
0:20:46,080 --> 0:20:51,900
 In my case, I want to learn networking. Whenever you want to learn networking, you will often see

291
0:20:51,900 --> 0:20:58,000
 this OC reference model on the left, which is a new model. But the older model, the Internet

292
0:20:58,000 --> 0:21:03,380
 Protocol Suite, was before the OC reference model. But both of them provide a structured way

293
0:21:03,380 --> 0:21:10,280
 to look at networks as being divided into layers. And the whole goal of having them in layers

294
0:21:10,280 --> 0:21:10,880
 is to be able to run a NMAP pen test workshop. So if you're interested in learning more about

295
0:21:10,880 --> 0:21:15,700
 the OCT frameworks here in relevance to the digital market, well, there's a lot more variety

296
0:21:20,060 --> 0:21:20,720
 there for you.

297
0:21:20,720 --> 0:21:24,880
 And so essentially you want to learn networking, on a Богut-Renewable Network or Web Router

298
0:21:24,880 --> 0:21:31,000
 or even on a AA � nor Frame in your network data. So these are four different ways that

299
0:21:31,000 --> 0:21:35,540
 you can see the improvement as you start to learn more about it.

300
0:21:35,540 --> 0:21:39,340
 Of course, you can find them and run them using wallets and online stores such as chainsaws.

301
0:21:39,340 --> 0:21:43,560
 SFPs, all of these things which are related to hardware.

302
0:21:44,160 --> 0:21:47,380
 Some of you might be more interested in the IP layers,

303
0:21:47,720 --> 0:21:50,700
 IP version 4, and there's something called IP version 6.

304
0:21:51,180 --> 0:21:54,200
 You can decide not to learn IP version 6 yet

305
0:21:54,200 --> 0:21:56,320
 because it's not very popular in Denmark.

306
0:21:56,760 --> 0:22:00,460
 You can also decide to spend some time on that subject

307
0:22:00,460 --> 0:22:04,120
 because you want to be an expert in IP version 6 security,

308
0:22:04,500 --> 0:22:06,940
 which is something that you need to know about

309
0:22:06,940 --> 0:22:08,280
 when you go into networks.

310
0:22:08,940 --> 0:22:12,300
 And a funny thing that you can say to new places

311
0:22:12,300 --> 0:22:13,800
 is if you go into networks,

312
0:22:14,060 --> 0:22:16,680
 you have IPv6 running in your network.

313
0:22:17,320 --> 0:22:19,880
 Maybe the IT department hasn't activated it,

314
0:22:20,220 --> 0:22:22,200
 but it is typically activated by default

315
0:22:22,200 --> 0:22:25,400
 on a lot of operating systems and network devices

316
0:22:25,400 --> 0:22:27,740
 and mobile phones and tablets.

317
0:22:27,740 --> 0:22:30,860
 All the mobile devices have IP version 6 enabled,

318
0:22:31,360 --> 0:22:33,960
 so there will be some IPv6 in your network

319
0:22:33,960 --> 0:22:35,500
 whether you know it or not.

320
0:22:36,940 --> 0:22:39,580
 Looking at the layers, you can go through each layer,

321
0:22:39,700 --> 0:22:42,120
 try to find the parts that you want to learn,

322
0:22:42,460 --> 0:22:44,460
 but there's also a lot of layers,

323
0:22:44,600 --> 0:22:45,920
 there's a lot of technologies,

324
0:22:46,340 --> 0:22:47,680
 there's lots of protocols.

325
0:22:48,240 --> 0:22:49,780
 Looking at this slide alone,

326
0:22:50,400 --> 0:22:53,200
 should you learn about XDR and NFS?

327
0:22:53,720 --> 0:22:54,420
 Perhaps not.

328
0:22:54,820 --> 0:22:56,040
 Maybe not the most important.

329
0:22:56,560 --> 0:22:58,540
 One of the most important would be HTTP,

330
0:22:59,280 --> 0:23:01,580
 and HTTP is built on TCP,

331
0:23:01,580 --> 0:23:04,920
 which is built on IP, IP version 4 and IP version 6,

332
0:23:05,360 --> 0:23:06,500
 so you would be required,

333
0:23:06,500 --> 0:23:09,260
 again, to learn some of the dependencies

334
0:23:09,260 --> 0:23:11,260
 before you can learn HTTP.

335
0:23:11,260 --> 0:23:14,260
 Luckily, some of these books that I recommend

336
0:23:14,260 --> 0:23:17,260
 actually has a walkthrough and discusses

337
0:23:17,260 --> 0:23:19,740
 some of the core protocols, so you can get started.

338
0:23:19,740 --> 0:23:22,740
 Especially the book called Practical Packet Analysis

339
0:23:22,740 --> 0:23:25,500
 has a nice description in few pages

340
0:23:25,500 --> 0:23:27,500
 about these specific protocols.

341
0:23:28,500 --> 0:23:30,500
 Otherwise, you would have to go and find

342
0:23:30,500 --> 0:23:32,500
 one of the big thousand-page books

343
0:23:32,500 --> 0:23:34,500
 that will go through each and every protocol,

344
0:23:34,500 --> 0:23:36,100
 but not tell you where, and how, and when,

345
0:23:36,100 --> 0:23:38,100
 to use each of these.

346
0:23:38,100 --> 0:23:40,100
 It will just have a description of all the protocols

347
0:23:40,100 --> 0:23:43,100
 with all the fields, which is a boring book.

348
0:23:43,100 --> 0:23:46,100
 I don't think there's much good network books,

349
0:23:46,100 --> 0:23:49,100
 but the Practical Packet Analysis will discuss

350
0:23:49,100 --> 0:23:52,100
 TCP, DNS, HTTP, DHCP,

351
0:23:52,100 --> 0:23:54,100
 some of these basic, basic protocols

352
0:23:54,100 --> 0:23:57,100
 for even getting connected to a network.

353
0:24:00,100 --> 0:24:04,100
 So, this slide has a lot of text,

354
0:24:04,100 --> 0:24:06,100
 and this is actually marked

355
0:24:06,100 --> 0:24:10,100
 my smallest list of recommended technologies

356
0:24:10,100 --> 0:24:13,100
 to learn in networking.

357
0:24:13,100 --> 0:24:16,100
 So, if you want to use Nmap efficiently,

358
0:24:16,100 --> 0:24:18,100
 you need to know networking.

359
0:24:18,100 --> 0:24:20,100
 So, you need to know some basic protocols

360
0:24:20,100 --> 0:24:22,100
 from the Internet Protocol Suite,

361
0:24:22,100 --> 0:24:26,100
 IPTCP, or TCP-IP as we have come to refer to it.

362
0:24:26,100 --> 0:24:30,100
 That is a protocol suite that has taken the whole world.

363
0:24:30,100 --> 0:24:32,100
 You can get by in your daily work

364
0:24:32,100 --> 0:24:36,100
 without having to use any other protocols than IP protocols.

365
0:24:36,100 --> 0:24:38,100
 There are some on lower levels,

366
0:24:38,100 --> 0:24:40,100
 there are some on higher levels.

367
0:24:40,100 --> 0:24:42,100
 This is a list of the ones

368
0:24:42,100 --> 0:24:44,100
 that I think you should look at first.

369
0:24:44,100 --> 0:24:46,100
 Those are the basic ones

370
0:24:46,100 --> 0:24:48,100
 to get access to a network.

371
0:24:48,100 --> 0:24:50,100
 They will help you debug errors

372
0:24:50,100 --> 0:24:53,100
 and be able to connect to the network.

373
0:24:53,100 --> 0:24:56,100
 So, this is my recommended list.

374
0:24:56,100 --> 0:24:59,100
 I also have some parts that are a bit optional.

375
0:24:59,100 --> 0:25:01,100
 So, on the network layer,

376
0:25:01,100 --> 0:25:04,100
 Ethernet, ARP, IPv4, and ICMP,

377
0:25:04,100 --> 0:25:05,100
 you need to know those.

378
0:25:05,100 --> 0:25:06,100
 You need to know those

379
0:25:06,100 --> 0:25:08,100
 to work in network and security.

380
0:25:08,100 --> 0:25:10,100
 But you also probably need to learn

381
0:25:10,100 --> 0:25:12,100
 a little bit of Wi-Fi,

382
0:25:12,100 --> 0:25:13,100
 because there are Wi-Fi out there

383
0:25:13,100 --> 0:25:15,100
 and all the clients are using Wi-Fi.

384
0:25:15,100 --> 0:25:17,100
 And IPv6 is coming,

385
0:25:17,100 --> 0:25:19,100
 and I think you should look at that.

386
0:25:19,100 --> 0:25:21,100
 But you can do that later.

387
0:25:21,100 --> 0:25:24,100
 Something that is essential though

388
0:25:24,100 --> 0:25:25,100
 on the transport layer

389
0:25:25,100 --> 0:25:27,100
 is that you can know the difference

390
0:25:27,100 --> 0:25:29,100
 between TCP and UDP.

391
0:25:29,100 --> 0:25:31,100
 So, you need to look at those.

392
0:25:31,100 --> 0:25:35,100
 Then we have some common upper layer protocols.

393
0:25:35,100 --> 0:25:37,100
 DHCP for configuring IP addresses,

394
0:25:37,100 --> 0:25:39,100
 DNS for domain name system,

395
0:25:39,100 --> 0:25:40,100
 looking up names,

396
0:25:40,100 --> 0:25:43,100
 and then of course, HTTP.

397
0:25:43,100 --> 0:25:45,100
 And you can learn a lot by only using

398
0:25:45,100 --> 0:25:47,100
 these protocols that I have listed.

399
0:25:47,100 --> 0:25:49,100
 You can run a lot of stuff in your lab,

400
0:25:49,100 --> 0:25:51,100
 on your laptop with HTTP.

401
0:25:51,100 --> 0:25:55,100
 You don't have to look much into HTTP at first,

402
0:25:55,100 --> 0:25:57,100
 but then when you have understood

403
0:25:57,100 --> 0:25:59,100
 the basic protocols,

404
0:25:59,100 --> 0:26:02,100
 you can add the layer of encryption

405
0:26:02,100 --> 0:26:03,100
 using HTTP,

406
0:26:03,100 --> 0:26:05,100
 which uses the transport layer,

407
0:26:05,100 --> 0:26:07,100
 the transport layer security.

408
0:26:07,100 --> 0:26:10,100
 And when you have learned that part with HTTPS,

409
0:26:10,100 --> 0:26:12,100
 you can start realizing that,

410
0:26:12,100 --> 0:26:14,100
 oh, hey, TLS is a generic protocol

411
0:26:14,100 --> 0:26:17,100
 for unwrapping all of our other protocols.

412
0:26:17,100 --> 0:26:19,100
 So, you have actually learned something

413
0:26:19,100 --> 0:26:21,100
 that is a dependency for security

414
0:26:21,100 --> 0:26:25,100
 in a lot of other protocols like SMTP for mail.

415
0:26:25,100 --> 0:26:27,100
 So, this is my basic go-to list

416
0:26:27,100 --> 0:26:31,100
 that I recommend that you look at and learn.

417
0:26:31,100 --> 0:26:35,100
 How to learn is another difficult question

418
0:26:35,100 --> 0:26:36,100
 to answer.

419
0:26:36,100 --> 0:26:38,100
 I like to learn new concepts from books.

420
0:26:38,100 --> 0:26:40,100
 They have a clear structure,

421
0:26:40,100 --> 0:26:41,100
 less confusion.

422
0:26:41,100 --> 0:26:43,100
 You will follow the path

423
0:26:43,100 --> 0:26:46,100
 that the writer made for the book.

424
0:26:46,100 --> 0:26:49,100
 You might not agree that if you know the subject

425
0:26:49,100 --> 0:26:50,100
 that this is the best way,

426
0:26:50,100 --> 0:26:53,100
 but good books will have a clear structure

427
0:26:53,100 --> 0:26:56,100
 so you can go from initial concepts

428
0:26:56,100 --> 0:26:58,100
 and all the way to the end of the book

429
0:26:58,100 --> 0:27:01,100
 and the target and the goal of the book.

430
0:27:01,100 --> 0:27:04,100
 So, I would recommend looking at some of the books.

431
0:27:04,100 --> 0:27:06,100
 There are lots of books available.

432
0:27:06,100 --> 0:27:08,100
 Some of them will have exercises.

433
0:27:08,100 --> 0:27:10,100
 If you are the type that does exercises,

434
0:27:10,100 --> 0:27:11,100
 then please do.

435
0:27:11,100 --> 0:27:13,100
 Otherwise, you can go to the Internet

436
0:27:13,100 --> 0:27:16,100
 and see if you can find CTFs or stuff

437
0:27:16,100 --> 0:27:19,100
 if you want to learn hacking, perhaps.

438
0:27:19,100 --> 0:27:23,100
 But going directly to a CTF on the Internet

439
0:27:23,100 --> 0:27:25,100
 is very difficult.

440
0:27:25,100 --> 0:27:28,100
 I enjoy a lot of the nice books from NoStarch.

441
0:27:28,100 --> 0:27:30,100
 I'm not sponsored in any way by them.

442
0:27:30,100 --> 0:27:33,100
 I really enjoy these books from NoStarch.

443
0:27:33,100 --> 0:27:35,100
 There's also a lot of Humble Bundles.

444
0:27:35,100 --> 0:27:37,100
 There's actually one right now,

445
0:27:37,100 --> 0:27:39,100
 Unix Humble Bundle,

446
0:27:39,100 --> 0:27:41,100
 which will provide you a book called

447
0:27:41,100 --> 0:27:43,100
 Classic Shell Scripting.

448
0:27:43,100 --> 0:27:45,100
 Classic Shell Scripting will tell you exactly

449
0:27:45,100 --> 0:27:48,100
 how to automate stuff using Unix Shell,

450
0:27:48,100 --> 0:27:50,100
 and it's one of my favorite books,

451
0:27:50,100 --> 0:27:52,100
 and I use a lot of the advice from that book

452
0:27:52,100 --> 0:27:53,100
 in my daily work.

453
0:27:53,100 --> 0:27:56,100
 And then you can get a bundle of books for $25,

454
0:27:56,100 --> 0:27:59,100
 which are legal, PDF formatted,

455
0:27:59,100 --> 0:28:01,100
 and some of them in the current bundle

456
0:28:01,100 --> 0:28:02,100
 is a little bit dated,

457
0:28:02,100 --> 0:28:05,100
 but some of them are also very, very new,

458
0:28:05,100 --> 0:28:08,100
 and I know that at least this current Humble Bundle,

459
0:28:08,100 --> 0:28:11,100
 some of the books are worth their price.

460
0:28:11,100 --> 0:28:14,100
 Sometimes you can also find books for free

461
0:28:14,100 --> 0:28:16,100
 if you give your email address,

462
0:28:16,100 --> 0:28:18,100
 and I think there was a presentation about

463
0:28:18,100 --> 0:28:20,100
 why it's not free to give your email address,

464
0:28:20,100 --> 0:28:22,100
 but I do it once in a while.

465
0:28:22,100 --> 0:28:24,100
 I provide my email address,

466
0:28:24,100 --> 0:28:26,100
 and I can get a book like

467
0:28:26,100 --> 0:28:29,100
 the Web Application Security Book from 2020.

468
0:28:29,100 --> 0:28:30,100
 You can download it for free

469
0:28:30,100 --> 0:28:31,100
 using the nginx.com.

470
0:28:32,100 --> 0:28:35,100
 library where they allow you to get it

471
0:28:35,100 --> 0:28:38,100
 if they get a chance to add you to a mailing list

472
0:28:38,100 --> 0:28:39,100
 and everything.

473
0:28:39,100 --> 0:28:41,100
 Of course, that's a price you have to pay,

474
0:28:41,100 --> 0:28:44,100
 but you are getting a full length book

475
0:28:44,100 --> 0:28:45,100
 that you can use for learning

476
0:28:45,100 --> 0:28:48,100
 Web Application Security specifically.

477
0:28:48,100 --> 0:28:50,100
 And I have multiple books like that

478
0:28:50,100 --> 0:28:52,100
 where I have provided an email address

479
0:28:52,100 --> 0:28:54,100
 and gotten the book,

480
0:28:54,100 --> 0:28:57,100
 and that is actually easier on a low budget.

481
0:28:57,100 --> 0:29:00,100
 All of my courses and exercise booklets

482
0:29:00,100 --> 0:29:01,100
 are available on GitHub,

483
0:29:01,100 --> 0:29:04,100
 so you can find a lot of exercises and slides there.

484
0:29:04,100 --> 0:29:06,100
 Of course, slides alone is not very often

485
0:29:06,100 --> 0:29:08,100
 a good solution.

486
0:29:08,100 --> 0:29:11,100
 It's certainly not a replacement for books.

487
0:29:11,100 --> 0:29:14,100
 So maybe combine some of these

488
0:29:14,100 --> 0:29:16,100
 into your own reading plan.

489
0:29:19,100 --> 0:29:21,100
 When you know these basic protocols,

490
0:29:21,100 --> 0:29:23,100
 we have decided to learn these,

491
0:29:23,100 --> 0:29:24,100
 we have learned these,

492
0:29:24,100 --> 0:29:26,100
 then you can go into different directions

493
0:29:26,100 --> 0:29:29,100
 because if you have a core concept down,

494
0:29:29,100 --> 0:29:30,100
 you have some basic concepts,

495
0:29:30,100 --> 0:29:32,100
 if you have a basic concept down,

496
0:29:32,100 --> 0:29:34,100
 you can go into something like, say,

497
0:29:34,100 --> 0:29:37,100
 a basic investigation of a security incident.

498
0:29:37,100 --> 0:29:41,100
 You can look at existing packet dumps on the Internet

499
0:29:41,100 --> 0:29:44,100
 because then you can actually look at packets,

500
0:29:44,100 --> 0:29:46,100
 you can look at packet files,

501
0:29:46,100 --> 0:29:49,100
 you even know how perhaps to capture files,

502
0:29:49,100 --> 0:29:51,100
 working with packet captures,

503
0:29:51,100 --> 0:29:54,100
 and then you can start doing port mirroring perhaps,

504
0:29:54,100 --> 0:29:57,100
 you can start to look into understanding

505
0:29:57,100 --> 0:29:59,100
 what a switch does, what Ethernet is,

506
0:29:59,100 --> 0:30:02,100
 and that will actually allow you to progress

507
0:30:02,100 --> 0:30:05,100
 in your working of network and security.

508
0:30:05,100 --> 0:30:07,100
 I recommend this book,

509
0:30:07,100 --> 0:30:08,100
 The Practical Packet Analysis,

510
0:30:08,100 --> 0:30:11,100
 because that will explain how to do sniffing,

511
0:30:11,100 --> 0:30:14,100
 but there's also a lot of educational materials

512
0:30:14,100 --> 0:30:17,100
 from other organizations like ENISA.

513
0:30:17,100 --> 0:30:20,100
 I'm using some of the ENISA materials in my courses.

514
0:30:20,100 --> 0:30:24,100
 They have more or less complete courses

515
0:30:24,100 --> 0:30:28,100
 about computer forensics, network investigation,

516
0:30:28,100 --> 0:30:30,100
 some of them are a bit dated,

517
0:30:30,100 --> 0:30:34,100
 but they more or less provide links to the same tools

518
0:30:34,100 --> 0:30:36,100
 that I use for my teaching,

519
0:30:36,100 --> 0:30:38,100
 which is why I've started to use those,

520
0:30:38,100 --> 0:30:41,100
 because it was a good fit for the core concepts

521
0:30:41,100 --> 0:30:43,100
 that I already use.

522
0:30:43,100 --> 0:30:46,100
 I just have to check time.

523
0:30:46,100 --> 0:30:48,100
 Okay, not bad.

524
0:30:53,100 --> 0:30:57,100
 So, yes, the ENISA documents are some that I also recommend,

525
0:30:57,100 --> 0:30:59,100
 and they are paid for by the EU,

526
0:30:59,100 --> 0:31:01,100
 so that is us,

527
0:31:01,100 --> 0:31:03,100
 so you can just as well use that.

528
0:31:03,100 --> 0:31:05,100
 It's free for you to use.

529
0:31:05,100 --> 0:31:08,100
 Some of the information that you can also use

530
0:31:08,100 --> 0:31:11,100
 is all the standards,

531
0:31:11,100 --> 0:31:13,100
 all the hacker texts,

532
0:31:13,100 --> 0:31:16,100
 and I force my students

533
0:31:16,100 --> 0:31:19,100
 to go through a list of devices,

534
0:31:19,100 --> 0:31:21,100
 not devices, articles and formats.

535
0:31:21,100 --> 0:31:24,100
 So I recommend that you read

536
0:31:24,100 --> 0:31:26,100
 all the hacker text files,

537
0:31:26,100 --> 0:31:28,100
 computer science papers,

538
0:31:28,100 --> 0:31:29,100
 web articles,

539
0:31:29,100 --> 0:31:31,100
 book chapters for free on the internet,

540
0:31:31,100 --> 0:31:33,100
 standard documents,

541
0:31:33,100 --> 0:31:34,100
 and then, of course,

542
0:31:34,100 --> 0:31:36,100
 the internet requests for comments,

543
0:31:36,100 --> 0:31:38,100
 which are describing the internet standards

544
0:31:38,100 --> 0:31:39,100
 that we all use.

545
0:31:39,100 --> 0:31:41,100
 The goal is to make sure

546
0:31:41,100 --> 0:31:42,100
 that you have been subjected

547
0:31:42,100 --> 0:31:44,100
 to the different formats

548
0:31:44,100 --> 0:31:46,100
 where you can find information.

549
0:31:46,100 --> 0:31:48,100
 So it may not be nice

550
0:31:48,100 --> 0:31:50,100
 to look at an old ASCII drawing

551
0:31:50,100 --> 0:31:51,100
 and an old hacker text,

552
0:31:51,100 --> 0:31:53,100
 but if you can understand that one

553
0:31:53,100 --> 0:31:55,100
 and spend a little bit of time,

554
0:31:55,100 --> 0:31:57,100
 then later on in your career,

555
0:31:57,100 --> 0:31:59,100
 when you meet such a format,

556
0:31:59,100 --> 0:32:01,100
 it will be easier for you to read it.

557
0:32:01,100 --> 0:32:03,100
 So I recommend subjecting yourself

558
0:32:03,100 --> 0:32:06,100
 to these different formats of learning.

559
0:32:06,100 --> 0:32:08,100
 Having to read a computer science paper

560
0:32:08,100 --> 0:32:10,100
 for the first time

561
0:32:10,100 --> 0:32:12,100
 might be a little bit hard,

562
0:32:12,100 --> 0:32:14,100
 but if the first computer science paper

563
0:32:14,100 --> 0:32:17,100
 you read is about Meltdown and Spectra,

564
0:32:17,100 --> 0:32:19,100
 then you have to both understand

565
0:32:19,100 --> 0:32:21,100
 the format and how it's written

566
0:32:21,100 --> 0:32:23,100
 and some kind of advanced subject.

567
0:32:23,100 --> 0:32:24,100
 So I think it's better

568
0:32:24,100 --> 0:32:26,100
 to go out and investigate

569
0:32:26,100 --> 0:32:28,100
 the different ways of finding information

570
0:32:28,100 --> 0:32:30,100
 about network and security.

571
0:32:30,100 --> 0:32:32,100
 Also, when you do this,

572
0:32:32,100 --> 0:32:34,100
 you will also meet a lot of organizations,

573
0:32:34,100 --> 0:32:36,100
 groups, persons, authors,

574
0:32:36,100 --> 0:32:39,100
 and that will start your list

575
0:32:39,100 --> 0:32:42,100
 of people to follow information

576
0:32:42,100 --> 0:32:44,100
 from this author,

577
0:32:44,100 --> 0:32:46,100
 if you like the way he writes,

578
0:32:46,100 --> 0:32:47,100
 she writes,

579
0:32:47,100 --> 0:32:49,100
 then you can look at

580
0:32:49,100 --> 0:32:51,100
 what other books they have written perhaps,

581
0:32:51,100 --> 0:32:53,100
 you can dig into their material,

582
0:32:53,100 --> 0:32:55,100
 and that is something that I do a lot,

583
0:32:55,100 --> 0:32:58,100
 and in my list of all of these papers

584
0:32:58,100 --> 0:32:59,100
 and resources,

585
0:32:59,100 --> 0:33:01,100
 I actually have tried to put in

586
0:33:01,100 --> 0:33:03,100
 some of my favorite authors,

587
0:33:03,100 --> 0:33:05,100
 so whenever you list,

588
0:33:05,100 --> 0:33:09,100
 look at the list from my course,

589
0:33:09,100 --> 0:33:12,100
 like, let's see if you can get this one to open,

590
0:33:12,100 --> 0:33:14,100
 open link,

591
0:33:14,100 --> 0:33:16,100
 so if you go to this course,

592
0:33:16,100 --> 0:33:18,100
 which is Communication and Network Security,

593
0:33:18,100 --> 0:33:20,100
 there's a list of the books

594
0:33:20,100 --> 0:33:22,100
 that I use for this course,

595
0:33:22,100 --> 0:33:24,100
 this is the primary literature,

596
0:33:24,100 --> 0:33:26,100
 I'm not sure if you can read it down there,

597
0:33:26,100 --> 0:33:28,100
 so the Applied Network Security Monitoring

598
0:33:28,100 --> 0:33:29,100
 and Practical Packet Analysis

599
0:33:29,100 --> 0:33:31,100
 and Linux Basics for Hackers,

600
0:33:31,100 --> 0:33:32,100
 those are the primary books

601
0:33:32,100 --> 0:33:33,100
 that we are following,

602
0:33:33,100 --> 0:33:35,100
 because they have some structure

603
0:33:35,100 --> 0:33:37,100
 and go from the initial concepts

604
0:33:37,100 --> 0:33:39,100
 and all the way to some level,

605
0:33:39,100 --> 0:33:41,100
 and I recommend that people buy these,

606
0:33:41,100 --> 0:33:44,100
 but I will also have supporting literature,

607
0:33:44,100 --> 0:33:47,100
 I will have links to old PDFs

608
0:33:47,100 --> 0:33:49,100
 from 80s, 90s perhaps,

609
0:33:49,100 --> 0:33:51,100
 I will have some of the newer stuff

610
0:33:51,100 --> 0:33:52,100
 that is going on,

611
0:33:52,100 --> 0:33:54,100
 Transport Layer Security,

612
0:33:54,100 --> 0:33:57,100
 making sure that people have been subjected to that,

613
0:33:57,100 --> 0:33:59,100
 and all the way to WireGuard,

614
0:33:59,100 --> 0:34:01,100
 which is a new VPN protocol,

615
0:34:01,100 --> 0:34:04,100
 so being able to read the different formats

616
0:34:04,100 --> 0:34:06,100
 will allow you to learn new stuff.

617
0:34:06,100 --> 0:34:09,100
 Oh no, 10 minutes!

618
0:34:09,100 --> 0:34:12,100
 And you're welcome to use that list of course,

619
0:34:12,100 --> 0:34:13,100
 that is my courses,

620
0:34:13,100 --> 0:34:14,100
 and that's also listed,

621
0:34:14,100 --> 0:34:16,100
 I think, in the program.

622
0:34:16,100 --> 0:34:18,100
 There's a lot of tools to learn,

623
0:34:18,100 --> 0:34:20,100
 I really love a lot of open source,

624
0:34:20,100 --> 0:34:22,100
 a lot of Linux, Unix,

625
0:34:22,100 --> 0:34:24,100
 you should of course also learn

626
0:34:24,100 --> 0:34:27,100
 some of the tools that everybody uses,

627
0:34:27,100 --> 0:34:28,100
 like Git and GitHub,

628
0:34:28,100 --> 0:34:31,100
 you should have a little bit of programming experience,

629
0:34:31,100 --> 0:34:34,100
 I recommend using something called Ansible,

630
0:34:34,100 --> 0:34:37,100
 because you will be installing and configuring software,

631
0:34:37,100 --> 0:34:39,100
 and you can use that in production use

632
0:34:39,100 --> 0:34:41,100
 if you know Ansible.

633
0:34:41,100 --> 0:34:43,100
 Also, I have decided to use Elasticsearch

634
0:34:43,100 --> 0:34:44,100
 in a lot of my courses,

635
0:34:44,100 --> 0:34:48,100
 because it's a generic engine for storing data,

636
0:34:48,100 --> 0:34:50,100
 so you can store even networks,

637
0:34:50,100 --> 0:34:52,100
 network data, security data,

638
0:34:52,100 --> 0:34:53,100
 you can have logs,

639
0:34:53,100 --> 0:34:55,100
 you can have measurements in Elasticsearch,

640
0:34:55,100 --> 0:34:58,100
 and there's already a huge body of programs

641
0:34:58,100 --> 0:35:00,100
 that use Elasticsearch,

642
0:35:00,100 --> 0:35:02,100
 so you can build all of these systems

643
0:35:02,100 --> 0:35:04,100
 if you know Elasticsearch.

644
0:35:04,100 --> 0:35:06,100
 You can find other systems,

645
0:35:06,100 --> 0:35:09,100
 and you can perhaps find the best three systems,

646
0:35:09,100 --> 0:35:11,100
 but if they each use a different database below,

647
0:35:11,100 --> 0:35:14,100
 you will have to learn those three databases below

648
0:35:14,100 --> 0:35:16,100
 to use those tools.

649
0:35:16,100 --> 0:35:18,100
 So instead, I would rather teach my students

650
0:35:18,100 --> 0:35:19,100
 to use Elasticsearch,

651
0:35:19,100 --> 0:35:21,100
 a little bit, enough to get running,

652
0:35:21,100 --> 0:35:25,100
 and then they can put on other tools on top of that.

653
0:35:25,100 --> 0:35:28,100
 I also recommend that you immediately today

654
0:35:28,100 --> 0:35:31,100
 start running some virtual machines on your laptop,

655
0:35:31,100 --> 0:35:34,100
 having a hacker lab with Kali Linux

656
0:35:34,100 --> 0:35:37,100
 and perhaps some other system like a Debian,

657
0:35:37,100 --> 0:35:39,100
 then you can run Elasticsearch on the Debian,

658
0:35:39,100 --> 0:35:41,100
 you can run hacker tools on the Kali,

659
0:35:41,100 --> 0:35:43,100
 and you will get practical work done

660
0:35:43,100 --> 0:35:46,100
 with these virtual machines on your laptop,

661
0:35:46,100 --> 0:35:48,100
 sitting in a tent on Fyn.

662
0:35:49,100 --> 0:35:52,100
 Some of the tools that I recommend you also look at

663
0:35:52,100 --> 0:35:54,100
 are also very generic,

664
0:35:54,100 --> 0:35:56,100
 like the one called MallTrail,

665
0:35:56,100 --> 0:35:58,100
 which will have a lot of negative lists

666
0:35:58,100 --> 0:36:00,100
 incorporated into the tool,

667
0:36:00,100 --> 0:36:03,100
 so that will be a source for lists that you can use.

668
0:36:03,100 --> 0:36:05,100
 It will have a lot of lists and references

669
0:36:05,100 --> 0:36:09,100
 to other projects that are about security,

670
0:36:09,100 --> 0:36:12,100
 but this is a very easy tool to get started.

671
0:36:12,100 --> 0:36:16,100
 Ansible is a configuration management tool,

672
0:36:16,100 --> 0:36:18,100
 and of course, multiple tools exist,

673
0:36:18,100 --> 0:36:21,100
 but specifically for networking,

674
0:36:21,100 --> 0:36:24,100
 I think Ansible is a very nice choice,

675
0:36:24,100 --> 0:36:26,100
 because you can use Ansible

676
0:36:26,100 --> 0:36:28,100
 to watch a generic Linux,

677
0:36:28,100 --> 0:36:30,100
 Debian, Kali perhaps,

678
0:36:30,100 --> 0:36:32,100
 but you can also use it to hardware,

679
0:36:32,100 --> 0:36:37,100
 so Cisco IOS, Juniper Junos, Miraki, Dell,

680
0:36:37,100 --> 0:36:39,100
 all of these listed up here

681
0:36:39,100 --> 0:36:42,100
 can be configured using Ansible.

682
0:36:42,100 --> 0:36:44,100
 So it is a nice generic tool

683
0:36:44,100 --> 0:36:46,100
 that goes across a range of systems,

684
0:36:46,100 --> 0:36:47,100
 so you only have to learn

685
0:36:47,100 --> 0:36:49,100
 one configuration management tool,

686
0:36:49,100 --> 0:36:52,100
 and you should know how to use configuration management,

687
0:36:52,100 --> 0:36:54,100
 and if you have learned Ansible,

688
0:36:54,100 --> 0:36:55,100
 it will still be easier to learn

689
0:36:55,100 --> 0:36:58,100
 some of the other configuration management tools.

690
0:36:58,100 --> 0:37:01,100
 So it's not wasted if you learn this tool.

691
0:37:01,100 --> 0:37:04,100
 Python, YAML, Git, GitHub

692
0:37:04,100 --> 0:37:07,100
 will open a world of tools that you can use.

693
0:37:07,100 --> 0:37:09,100
 Listed just down at the bottom

694
0:37:09,100 --> 0:37:11,100
 is one called Oxidized,

695
0:37:11,100 --> 0:37:13,100
 that will work together with network equipment.

696
0:37:13,100 --> 0:37:16,100
 Just by running Oxidized in a network,

697
0:37:16,100 --> 0:37:20,100
 gathering configurations from network devices

698
0:37:20,100 --> 0:37:23,100
 will provide a backup of the network configuration,

699
0:37:23,100 --> 0:37:26,100
 and many, many networks and companies

700
0:37:26,100 --> 0:37:29,100
 don't have a backup of their devices.

701
0:37:29,100 --> 0:37:32,100
 So just by taking a single, simple tool like this,

702
0:37:32,100 --> 0:37:37,100
 you can provide value for a network.

703
0:37:37,100 --> 0:37:40,100
 I already told you that Elasticsearch

704
0:37:40,100 --> 0:37:42,100
 allows you to run things on top of it,

705
0:37:42,100 --> 0:37:44,100
 but it even goes further

706
0:37:44,100 --> 0:37:46,100
 because they have defined

707
0:37:46,100 --> 0:37:48,100
 a schema, Elastic Common Schema,

708
0:37:48,100 --> 0:37:50,100
 which is an open-source specification

709
0:37:50,100 --> 0:37:52,100
 that would actually allow you to

710
0:37:52,100 --> 0:37:54,100
 add logs from different firewall formats

711
0:37:54,100 --> 0:37:56,100
 into the same database,

712
0:37:56,100 --> 0:37:58,100
 so you would be able to do

713
0:37:58,100 --> 0:38:00,100
 cross-platform comparison of data

714
0:38:00,100 --> 0:38:04,100
 and gather that, collect that, centralize that.

715
0:38:04,100 --> 0:38:06,100
 I really enjoy Elasticsearch a lot,

716
0:38:06,100 --> 0:38:09,100
 and some of the tools that I use with Elasticsearch

717
0:38:09,100 --> 0:38:12,100
 is Logstash, PacketBeat, ElastiFlow,

718
0:38:12,100 --> 0:38:14,100
 and PacketBeat allows me at home

719
0:38:14,100 --> 0:38:15,100
 to check how much I'm using,

720
0:38:15,100 --> 0:38:18,100
 to check how much of my traffic is IPv4

721
0:38:18,100 --> 0:38:20,100
 and how much is IPv6,

722
0:38:20,100 --> 0:38:22,100
 and I can create with my mouse

723
0:38:22,100 --> 0:38:24,100
 using Kibana on top of Elasticsearch

724
0:38:24,100 --> 0:38:27,100
 a nice graph, so I have a graph at home

725
0:38:27,100 --> 0:38:30,100
 showing IPv4 versus IPv6.

726
0:38:30,100 --> 0:38:32,100
 So some days I'm running something like

727
0:38:32,100 --> 0:38:35,100
 43% of my traffic is IPv6.

728
0:38:35,100 --> 0:38:37,100
 Stuff like that is fantastic,

729
0:38:37,100 --> 0:38:39,100
 and if you go to PacketBeat,

730
0:38:39,100 --> 0:38:42,100
 it can also decipher DNS packets,

731
0:38:42,100 --> 0:38:44,100
 so if you're learning DNS, start up PacketBeat,

732
0:38:44,100 --> 0:38:47,100
 which is quite easily on most platforms.

733
0:38:47,100 --> 0:38:50,100
 It's just Go programs, I think, most of it.

734
0:38:50,100 --> 0:38:52,100
 Then you actually have graphs already,

735
0:38:52,100 --> 0:38:56,100
 and you can understand some of these concepts better.

736
0:38:56,100 --> 0:38:59,100
 If we look at communications and network security,

737
0:38:59,100 --> 0:39:03,100
 which was the course that I listed earlier,

738
0:39:03,100 --> 0:39:07,100
 we typically would have the description of a course,

739
0:39:07,100 --> 0:39:09,100
 which is also a way and information

740
0:39:09,100 --> 0:39:12,100
 for how to learn a subject.

741
0:39:12,100 --> 0:39:13,100
 This one is open.

742
0:39:13,100 --> 0:39:15,100
 You can read the studio ordering,

743
0:39:15,100 --> 0:39:17,100
 you can read the curriculum requirements,

744
0:39:17,100 --> 0:39:19,100
 not the curriculum requirements,

745
0:39:19,100 --> 0:39:21,100
 but the structure of this course.

746
0:39:21,100 --> 0:39:24,100
 It fits into an overall architecture

747
0:39:24,100 --> 0:39:27,100
 of this one called Diploma in IT Security,

748
0:39:27,100 --> 0:39:30,100
 but it is also a dependency

749
0:39:30,100 --> 0:39:32,100
 for a lot of other educations.

750
0:39:32,100 --> 0:39:35,100
 The same subjects, networking and communications

751
0:39:35,100 --> 0:39:38,100
 and security is what is needed

752
0:39:38,100 --> 0:39:42,100
 for lots and lots of other educational paths

753
0:39:42,100 --> 0:39:45,100
 that you want to go through.

754
0:39:45,100 --> 0:39:47,100
 If we go to that specific course,

755
0:39:47,100 --> 0:39:49,100
 it has these books listed.

756
0:39:49,100 --> 0:39:51,100
 I have a lecture plan.

757
0:39:51,100 --> 0:39:53,100
 Going through the lecture plan would provide you

758
0:39:53,100 --> 0:39:56,100
 with a reading list if you wanted to read it at home.

759
0:39:56,100 --> 0:39:59,100
 Reading these books in that order

760
0:39:59,100 --> 0:40:02,100
 would allow you to go through these subjects.

761
0:40:02,100 --> 0:40:04,100
 I also have the presentations for this.

762
0:40:04,100 --> 0:40:07,100
 We teach 14 evenings in total for this course.

763
0:40:07,100 --> 0:40:11,100
 I have put it into different categories,

764
0:40:11,100 --> 0:40:14,100
 so each of these 14 evenings

765
0:40:14,100 --> 0:40:16,100
 will have a specific subject.

766
0:40:16,100 --> 0:40:18,100
 If you wanted to learn communications

767
0:40:18,100 --> 0:40:20,100
 and network security,

768
0:40:20,100 --> 0:40:22,100
 you can take these 14 evenings

769
0:40:22,100 --> 0:40:24,100
 and try to do the same at home.

770
0:40:24,100 --> 0:40:26,100
 First, set up a hacker lab,

771
0:40:26,100 --> 0:40:28,100
 and then you would go through

772
0:40:28,100 --> 0:40:30,100
 all of these different lectures.

773
0:40:30,100 --> 0:40:34,100
 I actually didn't show you,

774
0:40:34,100 --> 0:40:39,100
 but at the bottom is the list of evenings.

775
0:40:39,100 --> 0:40:41,100
 One evening is about

776
0:40:41,100 --> 0:40:42,100
 TCP IP,

777
0:40:42,100 --> 0:40:45,100
 one is about firewalls,

778
0:40:45,100 --> 0:40:47,100
 one is about encryption,

779
0:40:47,100 --> 0:40:49,100
 and that might also help you

780
0:40:49,100 --> 0:40:52,100
 in getting a crack at some of these areas.

781
0:40:58,100 --> 0:41:00,100
 I also use some other books on this course,

782
0:41:00,100 --> 0:41:03,100
 like open source manuals,

783
0:41:03,100 --> 0:41:05,100
 like the Debian Administrator's Handbook,

784
0:41:05,100 --> 0:41:07,100
 the Kali Linux Revealed book.

785
0:41:07,100 --> 0:41:10,100
 Those are PDF files that you can download,

786
0:41:10,100 --> 0:41:12,100
 and they will provide you some information

787
0:41:12,100 --> 0:41:13,100
 about how to run Linux

788
0:41:13,100 --> 0:41:15,100
 if you're new to Linux,

789
0:41:15,100 --> 0:41:17,100
 and you need to know Linux

790
0:41:17,100 --> 0:41:19,100
 to work in network and security.

791
0:41:19,100 --> 0:41:20,100
 Not just me saying it,

792
0:41:20,100 --> 0:41:22,100
 but there's just so many tools

793
0:41:22,100 --> 0:41:24,100
 that you need to know Linux Unix

794
0:41:24,100 --> 0:41:26,100
 to work in network and security.

795
0:41:30,100 --> 0:41:32,100
 Also, you need a little bit of devices,

796
0:41:32,100 --> 0:41:35,100
 and I would recommend going to a trash can somewhere

797
0:41:35,100 --> 0:41:37,100
 and see if you can find devices.

798
0:41:37,100 --> 0:41:39,100
 You can get a lot of devices free,

799
0:41:39,100 --> 0:41:43,100
 you can get a lot of devices cheaply

800
0:41:43,100 --> 0:41:46,100
 on eBay and places like that.

801
0:41:46,100 --> 0:41:51,100
 I usually have an OpenBSD router with me,

802
0:41:51,100 --> 0:41:53,100
 I have a couple of Juniper switches,

803
0:41:53,100 --> 0:41:54,100
 and a small TP-Link,

804
0:41:54,100 --> 0:41:57,100
 which is a really crappy software device,

805
0:41:57,100 --> 0:41:59,100
 but it's interesting nonetheless.

806
0:41:59,100 --> 0:42:01,100
 It will show you some of the restrictions

807
0:42:01,100 --> 0:42:03,100
 that are in modern systems,

808
0:42:03,100 --> 0:42:06,100
 and then typically an access point of some sort.

809
0:42:06,100 --> 0:42:08,100
 So that is like the most basic

810
0:42:08,100 --> 0:42:10,100
 lab network,

811
0:42:10,100 --> 0:42:12,100
 and if you work alone, live alone,

812
0:42:12,100 --> 0:42:15,100
 you might be able to use your regular home network.

813
0:42:15,100 --> 0:42:18,100
 Or if you don't mind a little bit of outage,

814
0:42:18,100 --> 0:42:20,100
 you can use your own network at home.

815
0:42:20,100 --> 0:42:22,100
 But if you have a family

816
0:42:22,100 --> 0:42:25,100
 working with video meetings and Zoom and teaching,

817
0:42:25,100 --> 0:42:27,100
 then probably you shouldn't break their Wi-Fi

818
0:42:27,100 --> 0:42:29,100
 while they are learning.

819
0:42:29,100 --> 0:42:33,100
 It's better to have a separate network for that.

820
0:42:33,100 --> 0:42:35,100
 There's a bit of a reference to

821
0:42:35,100 --> 0:42:37,100
 some hardware that I have used earlier,

822
0:42:37,100 --> 0:42:41,100
 the one called TP-Link TL-VN722N.

823
0:42:41,100 --> 0:42:45,100
 It's a network card that you can buy for about €10.

824
0:42:45,100 --> 0:42:46,100
 That's not much,

825
0:42:46,100 --> 0:42:49,100
 so that will allow you to learn a lot.

826
0:42:49,100 --> 0:42:52,100
 But it only supported 2.4 GHz in the old version.

827
0:42:52,100 --> 0:42:54,100
 If you want to get better hardware,

828
0:42:54,100 --> 0:42:56,100
 that is of course better,

829
0:42:56,100 --> 0:42:58,100
 because it provides more features,

830
0:42:58,100 --> 0:43:01,100
 but then again it might be harder to get working.

831
0:43:01,100 --> 0:43:04,100
 So sometimes also getting a cheap,

832
0:43:04,100 --> 0:43:06,100
 popular hardware will allow you to learn,

833
0:43:06,100 --> 0:43:08,100
 what you need to learn,

834
0:43:08,100 --> 0:43:09,100
 and then later on,

835
0:43:09,100 --> 0:43:11,100
 when somebody else is paying,

836
0:43:11,100 --> 0:43:13,100
 like a job, an organization,

837
0:43:13,100 --> 0:43:15,100
 you can buy the better hardware,

838
0:43:15,100 --> 0:43:17,100
 which has all the features.

839
0:43:17,100 --> 0:43:20,100
 Both of these usually work great in Kali Linux,

840
0:43:20,100 --> 0:43:22,100
 and Kali Linux is also the most popular

841
0:43:22,100 --> 0:43:24,100
 pentest hacking platform,

842
0:43:24,100 --> 0:43:26,100
 so there will be like,

843
0:43:26,100 --> 0:43:28,100
 usually there used to be like

844
0:43:28,100 --> 0:43:30,100
 hundreds, thousands of videos

845
0:43:30,100 --> 0:43:33,100
 if you just said Hack and Kali on YouTube.

846
0:43:33,100 --> 0:43:35,100
 And that is only on YouTube,

847
0:43:35,100 --> 0:43:37,100
 if you go to the whole internet,

848
0:43:37,100 --> 0:43:39,100
 there will be so many tools

849
0:43:39,100 --> 0:43:40,100
 that are written on Kali,

850
0:43:40,100 --> 0:43:42,100
 described on Kali,

851
0:43:42,100 --> 0:43:44,100
 there's a complete meta-sploit,

852
0:43:44,100 --> 0:43:46,100
 unleashed course material

853
0:43:46,100 --> 0:43:48,100
 that is running on Kali,

854
0:43:48,100 --> 0:43:51,100
 so using Kali might not be the one

855
0:43:51,100 --> 0:43:53,100
 that you want to use forever,

856
0:43:53,100 --> 0:43:55,100
 but for learning it might be the best,

857
0:43:55,100 --> 0:43:58,100
 because all the things that you will meet,

858
0:43:58,100 --> 0:43:59,100
 the problems you will meet,

859
0:43:59,100 --> 0:44:01,100
 has been met by other people,

860
0:44:01,100 --> 0:44:03,100
 and a lot of them will have solved it already,

861
0:44:03,100 --> 0:44:04,100
 so you can find the solution,

862
0:44:04,100 --> 0:44:06,100
 you can find the solution in seconds,

863
0:44:06,100 --> 0:44:09,100
 and that will be more efficient, hopefully.

864
0:44:09,100 --> 0:44:12,100
 Trying to finish up,

865
0:44:12,100 --> 0:44:14,100
 get started doing a hackalab,

866
0:44:14,100 --> 0:44:16,100
 look at some of the resources,

867
0:44:16,100 --> 0:44:19,100
 try to find some of the structured methods,

868
0:44:19,100 --> 0:44:20,100
 maybe a book,

869
0:44:20,100 --> 0:44:23,100
 maybe some of these ISC squared,

870
0:44:23,100 --> 0:44:24,100
 CBK,

871
0:44:24,100 --> 0:44:27,100
 try to do a reading plan,

872
0:44:27,100 --> 0:44:29,100
 plan which parts you want to learn,

873
0:44:29,100 --> 0:44:31,100
 if you want to learn an advanced tool,

874
0:44:31,100 --> 0:44:33,100
 it might be easier to

875
0:44:33,100 --> 0:44:35,100
 try to write down the dependencies first,

876
0:44:35,100 --> 0:44:37,100
 and make sure that you have them down,

877
0:44:37,100 --> 0:44:38,100
 you know what they are,

878
0:44:38,100 --> 0:44:41,100
 before you move to the advanced tool.

879
0:44:44,100 --> 0:44:46,100
 I think that was what I wanted to say,

880
0:44:46,100 --> 0:44:49,100
 so let's have a lot of questions.

881
0:44:53,100 --> 0:44:55,100
 Hi Henrik, thank you for the talk.

882
0:44:55,100 --> 0:44:57,100
 I was wondering if you have any advice

883
0:44:57,100 --> 0:45:03,100
 on showing your work on GitHub,

884
0:45:03,100 --> 0:45:04,100
 or GitLab,

885
0:45:04,100 --> 0:45:06,100
 let's say software developers get to

886
0:45:06,100 --> 0:45:09,100
 show their contributions to open source projects,

887
0:45:09,100 --> 0:45:11,100
 or make their own little projects on GitHub,

888
0:45:11,100 --> 0:45:14,100
 but I feel like it's a bit more difficult for,

889
0:45:14,100 --> 0:45:16,100
 let's say networking or Linux,

890
0:45:16,100 --> 0:45:18,100
 could it be, for example,

891
0:45:18,100 --> 0:45:21,100
 a home lab or some documentation?

892
0:45:21,100 --> 0:45:22,100
 Yeah, thank you.

893
0:45:25,100 --> 0:45:27,100
 I'm not sure how to respond,

894
0:45:27,100 --> 0:45:30,100
 so you have a problem on GitHub

895
0:45:30,100 --> 0:45:32,100
 to find information about networking and Linux?

896
0:45:32,100 --> 0:45:34,100
 Sorry.

897
0:45:39,100 --> 0:45:40,100
 What I mean is,

898
0:45:40,100 --> 0:45:42,100
 let's say if you're a software developer,

899
0:45:42,100 --> 0:45:44,100
 you get to add your, let's say,

900
0:45:44,100 --> 0:45:45,100
 GitHub to your CV,

901
0:45:45,100 --> 0:45:47,100
 and you get to talk to your employer,

902
0:45:47,100 --> 0:45:48,100
 and then you can show here,

903
0:45:48,100 --> 0:45:50,100
 let's say I made a snake game,

904
0:45:50,100 --> 0:45:53,100
 or I contributed to these open source projects,

905
0:45:53,100 --> 0:45:54,100
 but for example,

906
0:45:54,100 --> 0:45:56,100
 with network or security,

907
0:45:56,100 --> 0:45:58,100
 I think it's a bit more difficult to show

908
0:45:58,100 --> 0:46:00,100
 that you're doing stuff on your own,

909
0:46:00,100 --> 0:46:01,100
 or as,

910
0:46:01,100 --> 0:46:03,100
 yeah, so it's not just your studies,

911
0:46:03,100 --> 0:46:05,100
 that it's relevant for something,

912
0:46:05,100 --> 0:46:06,100
 for your employer.

913
0:46:06,100 --> 0:46:07,100
 Yeah.

914
0:46:07,100 --> 0:46:08,100
 Yeah.

915
0:46:10,100 --> 0:46:12,100
 Networking is code,

916
0:46:12,100 --> 0:46:14,100
 so network devices have code,

917
0:46:14,100 --> 0:46:16,100
 network requires code,

918
0:46:16,100 --> 0:46:19,100
 requires a lot of network near services,

919
0:46:19,100 --> 0:46:21,100
 like the Oxidize tool that was earlier.

920
0:46:21,100 --> 0:46:24,100
 So for something like the Oxidize tool,

921
0:46:24,100 --> 0:46:27,100
 you might be the one writing support

922
0:46:27,100 --> 0:46:30,100
 for a platform that is not supported right now,

923
0:46:30,100 --> 0:46:31,100
 in that,

924
0:46:31,100 --> 0:46:34,100
 and I went to some of the tools that I use,

925
0:46:34,100 --> 0:46:35,100
 like the one called Seek,

926
0:46:35,100 --> 0:46:38,100
 and actually I have made a small change

927
0:46:38,100 --> 0:46:40,100
 to the man page of Seek.

928
0:46:40,100 --> 0:46:41,100
 Yay!

929
0:46:41,100 --> 0:46:42,100
 It's not a big, huge thing,

930
0:46:42,100 --> 0:46:44,100
 but still you can do a lot of changes

931
0:46:44,100 --> 0:46:46,100
 and additions to some of these tools,

932
0:46:46,100 --> 0:46:49,100
 and I think that could be used in the same way,

933
0:46:49,100 --> 0:46:52,100
 but you can also do presentations in places,

934
0:46:52,100 --> 0:46:54,100
 and then put the presentations on GitHub,

935
0:46:54,100 --> 0:46:56,100
 which is what I have done.

936
0:46:56,100 --> 0:47:00,100
 So say you want to show off Wi-Fi security,

937
0:47:00,100 --> 0:47:02,100
 for a local organization,

938
0:47:02,100 --> 0:47:04,100
 you could do the slides and put them on GitHub.

939
0:47:04,100 --> 0:47:06,100
 And then you can write on your CV

940
0:47:06,100 --> 0:47:08,100
 that you did a presentation about Wi-Fi security

941
0:47:08,100 --> 0:47:11,100
 at the local Copenhagen meetup

942
0:47:11,100 --> 0:47:13,100
 for Wi-Fi enthusiasts.

943
0:47:17,100 --> 0:47:19,100
 Any more questions?

944
0:47:23,100 --> 0:47:25,100
 Not a lot of questions.

945
0:47:25,100 --> 0:47:27,100
 I should have talked more about the slides then.

946
0:47:30,100 --> 0:47:32,100
 Or maybe you said it all during the slides.

947
0:47:32,100 --> 0:47:35,100
 Yeah, there's a lot of links on this,

948
0:47:35,100 --> 0:47:38,100
 so go through the slides and send me email

949
0:47:38,100 --> 0:47:40,100
 if you need more help.

950
0:47:40,100 --> 0:47:42,100
 Look at perhaps KIA.

951
0:47:42,100 --> 0:47:44,100
 KIA is in Copenhagen,

952
0:47:44,100 --> 0:47:47,100
 but in Aarhus the same education is there,

953
0:47:47,100 --> 0:47:50,100
 and on UCL they have the same,

954
0:47:50,100 --> 0:47:53,100
 or more or less the same.

955
0:47:53,100 --> 0:47:55,100
 It's very common to have these basic network

956
0:47:55,100 --> 0:47:57,100
 and security courses,

957
0:47:57,100 --> 0:47:59,100
 so you will find them around the world, I'm sure.

958
0:48:00,100 --> 0:48:03,100
 Thank you very much Henrik.

959
0:48:03,100 --> 0:48:04,100
 Thank you.
