0:00:00,000 --> 0:00:15,820
 Okay, welcome everybody, and welcome to Saneva Book, Sandbooks, and you will talk about peerhood

2
0:00:15,820 --> 0:00:17,500
 and privatization of money.

3
0:00:18,700 --> 0:00:19,080
 Yes.

4
0:00:19,940 --> 0:00:22,460
 Thanks a lot for coming on this very early morning.

5
0:00:23,720 --> 0:00:28,600
 My name is Saneva, and I've just finished my PhD degree at the IT University, and I'm

6
0:00:28,600 --> 0:00:33,620
 now continuing there as a postdoctoral researcher at the Center for Digital Welfare, and I'm

7
0:00:33,620 --> 0:00:39,900
 going to be talking a bit today about research for my PhD on how, hold on, the dynamics of

8
0:00:39,900 --> 0:00:45,780
 Indonesian ride-hailing apps affect how money circulates through integrated payment platforms.

9
0:00:46,480 --> 0:00:48,840
 And if that's a lot of very long words, don't worry, there'll be more.

10
0:00:49,280 --> 0:00:50,240
 We'll go through them slowly.

11
0:00:51,060 --> 0:00:55,140
 And before I start, I just want to give a big shout-out to the illustrator, Nadia Rizki,

12
0:00:55,140 --> 0:00:58,020
 who's Indonesian and who made a lot of the drawings that are in this presentation.

13
0:00:59,540 --> 0:01:01,580
 So, would you like a top-up?

14
0:01:02,080 --> 0:01:06,880
 So, throughout my fieldwork in Indonesia, I encountered many variations of this particular

15
0:01:06,880 --> 0:01:11,760
 question from drivers of the ride-hailing platforms called Gojek and Grab, which are

16
0:01:11,760 --> 0:01:14,080
 equivalent to, like, Uber or Volt in Indonesia.

17
0:01:14,880 --> 0:01:19,840
 And what they wanted to know was, would I be interested in purchasing some digital money

18
0:01:19,840 --> 0:01:22,320
 for my own digital account?

19
0:01:22,640 --> 0:01:24,160
 So, in practice, it works like this.

20
0:01:24,160 --> 0:01:26,680
 The driver and I agree on a sum of money.

21
0:01:27,480 --> 0:01:28,160
 The driver...

22
0:01:28,600 --> 0:01:33,720
 Then uses the integrated payment mechanism of the app platform, so imagine Uber, but

23
0:01:33,720 --> 0:01:38,960
 with a separate money system, to make a digital transfer to my account.

24
0:01:38,960 --> 0:01:42,780
 And then I give the driver cash of the equivalent amount of money.

25
0:01:42,780 --> 0:01:48,280
 I can now use my newly topped-up balance to pay the next driver digitally, rather than

26
0:01:48,280 --> 0:01:50,280
 paying cash.

27
0:01:50,280 --> 0:01:55,060
 And for those familiar with the more seamless digital transactions of similar ride-hailing

28
0:01:55,060 --> 0:01:56,540
 and food delivery apps...

29
0:01:56,540 --> 0:01:57,540
 ...this moment of experience...

30
0:01:57,540 --> 0:01:58,040
 ...this moment of experience...

31
0:01:58,040 --> 0:02:04,620
 ...this moment of exchange between the driver and the passenger may seem peculiar or cumbersome,

32
0:02:04,620 --> 0:02:08,740
 so why not just pay the next driver with cash in the same way that I am de facto paying

33
0:02:08,740 --> 0:02:12,520
 this driver cash to have a digital balance?

34
0:02:12,520 --> 0:02:16,980
 The fact is that most people in Indonesia do not use credit or debit cards to make digital

35
0:02:16,980 --> 0:02:17,980
 payments.

36
0:02:17,980 --> 0:02:23,720
 And so this way, storing money as a digital credit and using a smartphone application

37
0:02:23,720 --> 0:02:27,160
 is becoming an increasingly popular way to have digital money.

38
0:02:28,040 --> 0:02:33,660
 Such mobile-based transactions are sometimes referred to as peer-to-peer, a concept I'm

39
0:02:33,660 --> 0:02:37,060
 sure a lot of you are familiar with from the tech sector.

40
0:02:37,060 --> 0:02:41,920
 And what they do in this context is allow users to transfer money digitally, directly,

41
0:02:41,920 --> 0:02:44,660
 without using a bank.

42
0:02:44,660 --> 0:02:50,160
 In Indonesia, the ride-hailing apps benefit from having a fleet of what's called on-demand

43
0:02:50,160 --> 0:02:56,520
 drivers who operate as exchange agents, like in this top-up moment, and therefore they

44
0:02:56,520 --> 0:02:57,920
 also operate as an extension.

45
0:02:58,040 --> 0:03:09,080
 So today, we're going to talk about four things.

46
0:03:09,080 --> 0:03:13,160
 First, we're going to examine the concept of peer-to-peer payment.

47
0:03:13,160 --> 0:03:17,580
 We're going to understand what digital money means in an Indonesian context, and we're

48
0:03:17,580 --> 0:03:23,060
 going to talk about how hassle-free digital payment is experienced at the interface level.

49
0:03:23,060 --> 0:03:27,760
 And finally, we're going to talk about how these apps configure consumers and drivers

50
0:03:28,040 --> 0:03:33,400
 to very specific transactional constellations.

51
0:03:33,400 --> 0:03:35,920
 Before we do that, I'm just going to quickly give you some context.

52
0:03:35,920 --> 0:03:42,420
 My research is based on six months of fieldwork in Jogja, a city in Indonesia, which took place

53
0:03:42,420 --> 0:03:47,980
 between 2018 and 2019, just as digital payments were becoming really popular.

54
0:03:47,980 --> 0:03:52,100
 And so I did a lot of what's called participant observation, as well as interviews with drivers,

55
0:03:52,100 --> 0:03:56,220
 customers, the companies, and several stakeholders.

56
0:03:56,220 --> 0:03:57,080
 But I also started to collect screenshots.

57
0:03:57,080 --> 0:03:57,160
 So I did a lot of what's called participant observation, as well as interviews with drivers, customers, the companies, and several stakeholders.

58
0:03:57,160 --> 0:03:58,040
 But I also started to collect screenshots.

59
0:03:58,040 --> 0:03:59,120
 So I did a lot of what's called participant observation, as well as interviews with drivers,

60
0:03:59,120 --> 0:04:04,360
 especially when drivers that I was interviewing started sharing me their screens to try and

61
0:04:04,360 --> 0:04:08,380
 explain how they experienced the digital economy.

62
0:04:08,380 --> 0:04:13,320
 And so I started to begin paying attention to these app interfaces to examine how the

63
0:04:13,320 --> 0:04:18,860
 app's design was affecting my engagement, not just with drivers, but with money itself.

64
0:04:18,860 --> 0:04:24,140
 For example, in this screenshot, which was when this app had given me a little token

65
0:04:24,140 --> 0:04:26,040
 to spin because I had made a transaction.

66
0:04:26,040 --> 0:04:27,040
 And the app goes.

67
0:04:27,040 --> 0:04:28,040
 It landed.

68
0:04:28,040 --> 0:04:32,680
 it, and it landed on six points. And the app was like, hey, you know, you could have had

69
0:04:32,680 --> 0:04:39,060
 175 points if only you had used GoPay instead of cash. So the design of these apps is not

70
0:04:39,060 --> 0:04:44,540
 neutral. It affects your experiences and shapes your behaviors, specifically into channeling

71
0:04:44,540 --> 0:04:50,720
 more money through the system. At the core of my work were two of the most prominent

72
0:04:50,720 --> 0:04:57,860
 Indonesian digital payment apps at the time, GoPay and Ovo. Both gained traction as integrated

73
0:04:57,860 --> 0:05:05,140
 payment mechanism of the respective ride-hailing platforms, Gojek and Grab. GoPay only exists

74
0:05:05,140 --> 0:05:09,980
 as a digital wallet inside the Gojek app, so not like mobile pay here. You can only

75
0:05:09,980 --> 0:05:17,180
 use it inside this platform. Ovo operates as a standalone discount platform for an Indonesian

76
0:05:17,180 --> 0:05:22,800
 mall franchise originally, and it also exists across multiple e-commerce platforms today,

77
0:05:22,800 --> 0:05:27,500
 so it's kind of like a white-label wallet, except they keep their wallet, or their label.

78
0:05:27,500 --> 0:05:27,840
 So the GoPay app is a digital wallet, and it's a digital wallet, and it's a digital

79
0:05:27,840 --> 0:05:32,700
 wallet. So through the fleets of their drivers, they have managed to convert customers of

80
0:05:32,700 --> 0:05:38,980
 existing transport services into customers of financial services. And that's really,

81
0:05:38,980 --> 0:05:46,260
 really critical. So let's examine the concept of a peer-to-peer transaction in more detail.

82
0:05:46,260 --> 0:05:54,000
 And to begin, let me describe an advertisement that Gojek released for Ramadan in 2016. These

83
0:05:54,000 --> 0:05:57,480
 are some stills from this advertisement. You see a young girl. She's wearing a white

84
0:05:57,480 --> 0:06:02,620
 shirt. She's asking her mother if she'll be home in time to break the fast for Ramadan.

85
0:06:02,620 --> 0:06:07,380
 As she dons her distinctly green Gojek helmet, the mother gives her a small package, telling

86
0:06:07,380 --> 0:06:12,420
 her to open it when she breaks the fast. We see clips of the mother driving passengers

87
0:06:12,420 --> 0:06:19,960
 to and fro. It's hot. She's tired. All these customers are cranky and rude. Her final passenger

88
0:06:19,960 --> 0:06:24,800
 is taking food to an orphanage for Ramadan, of course. And as she watches all these happy

89
0:06:24,800 --> 0:06:27,120
 children, the mother smiles, despite everything.

90
0:06:27,120 --> 0:06:34,220
 Meanwhile, her daughter opens the gift alone. It's a box of dates and it contains a card

91
0:06:34,220 --> 0:06:39,220
 from her mother apologising because they can't be together. The reason, she explains in the

92
0:06:39,220 --> 0:06:44,820
 note, is that mom needs to make sure that everyone else gets home in time to celebrate.

93
0:06:44,820 --> 0:06:49,640
 Finally, alone on her motorcycle and having her first drink of water, the mother receives

94
0:06:49,640 --> 0:06:56,740
 messages as customers send grateful thanks and positive ratings through the app platform.

95
0:06:56,740 --> 0:07:02,540
 So firstly, this advertisement presents the imagined participants in the exchange as two

96
0:07:02,540 --> 0:07:08,860
 overarching categories of user for the platform, the service provider and the service customer.

97
0:07:08,860 --> 0:07:14,500
 Secondly, besides the green helmet, the company itself is hardly present.

98
0:07:14,500 --> 0:07:18,820
 The app's role as an intermediator of the exchange only becomes apparent towards the

99
0:07:18,820 --> 0:07:21,740
 end when the phone makes its first appearance.

100
0:07:21,740 --> 0:07:27,340
 Instead, the advertisement emphasizes how these users are social equals, helping each

101
0:07:27,340 --> 0:07:32,040
 other out in an important social, cultural and religious event.

102
0:07:32,040 --> 0:07:36,520
 What it does not emphasize is the precarity of the single mother who cannot be home since

103
0:07:36,520 --> 0:07:38,620
 she must work long hours.

104
0:07:38,620 --> 0:07:44,220
 Instead, it almost seems as if she's doing this work out of a sense of social responsibility

105
0:07:44,220 --> 0:07:46,060
 towards her peers.

106
0:07:46,060 --> 0:07:51,720
 Notably, money is never seen nor mentioned.

107
0:07:51,720 --> 0:07:56,260
 The word peer itself, of course, has a very specific social meaning.

108
0:07:56,260 --> 0:08:00,720
 And instead, it generally refers to a person or object of equal status or rank to someone

109
0:08:00,720 --> 0:08:02,240
 or something else.

110
0:08:02,240 --> 0:08:06,920
 And I am particularly interested in how the phrase peer-to-peer, which we know as a term

111
0:08:06,920 --> 0:08:11,960
 from computing, came to describe an economic transaction, and how the retention of the

112
0:08:11,960 --> 0:08:19,220
 term peer in this context imbues the expression P2P payments with certain social meaning.

113
0:08:19,220 --> 0:08:21,620
 Firstly, various definitions of the word peer.

114
0:08:21,620 --> 0:08:26,380
 The word peer are all characterized by the critical underlying trait that being a peer

115
0:08:26,380 --> 0:08:30,120
 is something that can only be defined in relation to something else.

116
0:08:30,120 --> 0:08:37,080
 Secondly, all uses imply a sense of equality within the peer relation, whether it's socioeconomic

117
0:08:37,080 --> 0:08:40,340
 or computational.

118
0:08:40,340 --> 0:08:44,200
 Originally used to describe a non-hierarchical network topology, the phrase peer-to-peer

119
0:08:44,200 --> 0:08:50,640
 or P2P is now being more commonly used outside of tech communities to describe diverse types

120
0:08:50,640 --> 0:08:51,620
 of digital value transactions.

121
0:08:51,620 --> 0:08:58,380
 The term peer-to-peer is a term that is used to describe the ability of a person to transfer

122
0:08:58,380 --> 0:09:03,680
 money to another person without the use of a bank, a practice greatly valorized by the

123
0:09:03,680 --> 0:09:08,680
 first generation of the world's most advanced technology companies, such as Apple and Google.

124
0:09:08,680 --> 0:09:14,980
 The term peer-to-peer is a term that is used to describe the ability of a person to transfer

125
0:09:14,980 --> 0:09:21,580
 money to another person without the use of a bank, a practice greatly valorized by the

126
0:09:21,580 --> 0:09:26,840
 Solintec industry for creating access to important financial services normally considered

127
0:09:26,840 --> 0:09:32,460
 inaccessible to the poor or socio-economically marginalized people.

128
0:09:32,460 --> 0:09:38,560
 I am particularly interested in how this phrase came to describe this economic transaction,

129
0:09:38,560 --> 0:09:42,440
 and how the retention of the term peer to peer retains these social meanings, and I

130
0:09:42,440 --> 0:09:46,340
 would love to talk more about this with you, both today and later.

131
0:09:46,340 --> 0:09:50,460
 So a peer-to-peer transaction, where one person

132
0:09:50,460 --> 0:09:50,920
 transfers a form of as Neurodenamics to seconds and another person rose to

133
0:09:50,920 --> 0:09:51,420
 experience it, È that one person transfers the financial benefits from financial benefits

134
0:09:51,420 --> 0:09:51,500
 that all of their businesses do to that person climb up to that person, and then he comes

135
0:09:51,500 --> 0:09:51,520
 And in such a job this more clearly means that people need to meted to på me by the 보 y μια

136
0:09:51,520 --> 0:09:53,580
 digital value to another.

137
0:09:53,580 --> 0:09:55,980
 But the language of peer-to-peer is prominence

138
0:09:55,980 --> 0:09:57,520
 within the use of commercial digital wallets

139
0:09:57,520 --> 0:10:00,080
 and perpetuates the idea of mutual exchange

140
0:10:00,080 --> 0:10:03,400
 in accordance with the P2P ideal of a flat, symmetrical,

141
0:10:03,400 --> 0:10:07,140
 or egalitarian relationship without an intermediary.

142
0:10:07,140 --> 0:10:10,120
 But this transaction to someone has to happen

143
0:10:10,120 --> 0:10:14,620
 through something, through hardware, services, networks,

144
0:10:14,620 --> 0:10:18,220
 app interfaces, agents, third parties,

145
0:10:18,220 --> 0:10:21,020
 the intermediaries of the transaction.

146
0:10:21,020 --> 0:10:23,680
 Thus, rather than interpreting the two

147
0:10:23,680 --> 0:10:26,440
 as a numerical representation of the direction

148
0:10:26,440 --> 0:10:29,740
 of the transaction, it might serve an analytical purpose

149
0:10:29,740 --> 0:10:32,540
 to consider it a placeholder for the intermediaries

150
0:10:32,540 --> 0:10:34,380
 through which the transaction travels.

151
0:10:36,780 --> 0:10:37,600
 The apps.

152
0:10:39,180 --> 0:10:42,320
 The simplistic representation of the directional transaction

153
0:10:42,320 --> 0:10:46,300
 implied by the P2P acronym provides a superficial rendering

154
0:10:46,300 --> 0:10:50,040
 of the complex exchange relationship it actually contains.

155
0:10:50,040 --> 0:10:51,020
 It might instead be useful

156
0:10:51,020 --> 0:10:54,140
 to understand this term as a relational acronym,

157
0:10:54,140 --> 0:10:56,760
 where the so-called peers on either side of the exchange

158
0:10:56,760 --> 0:10:59,420
 have their own relationship, as well as relationships

159
0:10:59,420 --> 0:11:01,580
 to the intermediaries.

160
0:11:01,580 --> 0:11:02,960
 The use of the phrase peer-to-peer,

161
0:11:02,960 --> 0:11:06,100
 rather than, for instance, user-to-user,

162
0:11:06,100 --> 0:11:09,740
 undeniably also introduces all of these implicit social meaning

163
0:11:09,740 --> 0:11:12,020
 to the exchange relationship.

164
0:11:12,020 --> 0:11:14,380
 In the context of P2P and network nodes,

165
0:11:14,380 --> 0:11:17,260
 peer is used as an alternative to the hierarchical arrangement

166
0:11:17,260 --> 0:11:18,900
 of a client and server, right?

167
0:11:18,900 --> 0:11:20,720
 But what is the equality implied in the P2P

168
0:11:20,720 --> 0:11:22,500
 of payments?

169
0:11:22,500 --> 0:11:25,700
 Are they peers of equal social status?

170
0:11:25,700 --> 0:11:27,580
 Is it that they are accessing the same resource

171
0:11:27,580 --> 0:11:29,400
 or are presumed to have the same capacity

172
0:11:29,400 --> 0:11:30,840
 for operating the technology?

173
0:11:32,320 --> 0:11:34,360
 Is it within the configurations of the technology

174
0:11:34,360 --> 0:11:36,360
 that they're defined as equal parties?

175
0:11:36,360 --> 0:11:38,440
 Or is this peerhood one that emerges

176
0:11:38,440 --> 0:11:41,720
 when all other aspects of their social context are removed,

177
0:11:41,720 --> 0:11:44,060
 leaving only equality because everything

178
0:11:44,060 --> 0:11:47,000
 but the fact of the exchange itself has been stripped away?

179
0:11:47,840 --> 0:11:48,840
 The term P2P confuses not only the context of the exchange, but also the user.

180
0:11:48,840 --> 0:11:49,760
 The term P2P confuses not only the context of the exchange, but also the user.

181
0:11:49,760 --> 0:11:50,700
 The term P2P confuses not only the context of the exchange, but also the user.

182
0:11:50,720 --> 0:11:56,220
 these complex relational dynamics, but also obscures the power that the intermediaries

183
0:11:56,220 --> 0:12:03,680
 thus exert in configuring the conditions of the exchange relationship of the alleged peers.

184
0:12:03,680 --> 0:12:07,860
 In science and technology studies, we talk a lot about how the emergence of a technology

185
0:12:07,860 --> 0:12:11,900
 must also entail the emergence of the user.

186
0:12:11,900 --> 0:12:17,080
 So rather than being a specific person, the user is a composite character, a caricature

187
0:12:17,080 --> 0:12:22,600
 of what kinds of actions those designing the technology imagine its future users to make.

188
0:12:22,600 --> 0:12:28,960
 A peer is, of course, also a user of the technology, but the term peer, as we've discussed, introduces

189
0:12:28,960 --> 0:12:33,460
 additional dimensions to the person and perhaps also requirements from the technology.

190
0:12:33,460 --> 0:12:37,300
 If you're going to call your user a peer, what does that mean for your technology?

191
0:12:37,300 --> 0:12:40,380
 What is it you're going to have to put into that code to make sure that there's some sort

192
0:12:40,380 --> 0:12:43,600
 of equality in that relationship?

193
0:12:43,600 --> 0:12:46,360
 After all, how would you configure for peerhood?

194
0:12:46,360 --> 0:12:47,060
 So by thinking about peerhood, you're going to have to think about how do you configure

195
0:12:47,060 --> 0:12:47,560
 for peerhood, you're going to have to think about how do you configure for peerhood, you're going to have to think about how do you configure

196
0:12:47,560 --> 0:12:52,780
 these self-declared neutral platform companies and the configuration of users into exchange

197
0:12:52,780 --> 0:12:58,380
 relationships, we can really begin to unpack the effect of the technology on the many P's

198
0:12:58,380 --> 0:13:02,560
 and the many 2's within digital payments in Indonesia.

199
0:13:02,560 --> 0:13:05,040
 Which is what we'll do now.

200
0:13:05,040 --> 0:13:09,040
 So to understand how the apps work and how they're experienced in practice, we need first

201
0:13:09,040 --> 0:13:13,380
 to understand a few things about the existence of digital money in Indonesia.

202
0:13:13,380 --> 0:13:16,940
 Firstly, it's important to address the fact that Indonesia has

203
0:13:16,940 --> 0:13:21,040
 been going through massive economic growth since political and economic instability

204
0:13:21,040 --> 0:13:22,700
 in the late 90s.

205
0:13:22,700 --> 0:13:27,460
 But though the poverty rate has fallen, income and wealth inequality has also been growing

206
0:13:27,460 --> 0:13:28,460
 rapidly.

207
0:13:28,460 --> 0:13:33,940
 Presently, the richest four men share a combined wealth of more than the poorest million.

208
0:13:33,940 --> 0:13:40,640
 Thus, despite economic developments, many people still do not have or use a bank account.

209
0:13:40,640 --> 0:13:45,060
 The government has initiated multiple projects to increase what they call financial inclusion.

210
0:13:45,060 --> 0:13:46,060
 And in 2019, they declared that the government would be able to increase the amount of money

211
0:13:46,060 --> 0:13:46,560
 that the government would be able to invest in the country.

212
0:13:46,940 --> 0:13:50,340
 The government also declared that over 75% of the population now had access to a bank

213
0:13:50,340 --> 0:13:51,340
 account.

214
0:13:51,340 --> 0:13:56,900
 A critical step, one might argue, in an overarching public policy to become what they call a less-cash

215
0:13:56,900 --> 0:14:00,400
 society.

216
0:14:00,400 --> 0:14:04,600
 For most Indonesians, digital payment has generally meant using a debit card to make

217
0:14:04,600 --> 0:14:10,020
 a payment at a shop or an ATM card, which, aside from making withdrawals at an ATM machine,

218
0:14:10,020 --> 0:14:15,340
 also allows users to access their bank accounts or make transfers directly at the machine.

219
0:14:15,340 --> 0:14:16,740
 For most people that I spoke with?

220
0:14:16,940 --> 0:14:22,500
 The emphasis was therefore not on digital money itself, but on the ability of the ATM

221
0:14:22,500 --> 0:14:29,240
 to transition money between being digital and tangible, as they needed it to be.

222
0:14:29,240 --> 0:14:33,500
 Within the population that has access to a bank account, only a minority own a credit

223
0:14:33,500 --> 0:14:34,500
 card.

224
0:14:34,500 --> 0:14:39,860
 In fact, according to the Global Findex database, only 2.4% of the adult Indonesian population

225
0:14:39,860 --> 0:14:43,780
 had a credit card in 2017.

226
0:14:43,780 --> 0:14:45,380
 And for those who can pay by card?

227
0:14:45,380 --> 0:14:46,340
 This is the type of you that might meet you in a supermarket.

228
0:14:46,340 --> 0:14:52,580
 This is the type of you that might meet you in a store or cafe.

229
0:14:52,580 --> 0:14:55,660
 This thing that the machines are standing on is called the terminal tree.

230
0:14:55,660 --> 0:14:58,700
 It's a little structure.

231
0:14:58,700 --> 0:15:04,020
 So despite increasing interoperability between banks and payment providers, customers using

232
0:15:04,020 --> 0:15:09,220
 these infrastructures from banks other than their own can still face substantial fees.

233
0:15:09,220 --> 0:15:12,320
 And so for the people who are receiving payments, it becomes critical to be able to provide

234
0:15:12,320 --> 0:15:15,780
 for all of your customers, which is also quite expensive, and which means that those who

235
0:15:15,780 --> 0:15:19,280
 can afford to have all of the relevant terminals can.

236
0:15:19,280 --> 0:15:22,020
 And those who cannot, cannot.

237
0:15:22,020 --> 0:15:28,780
 Therefore, each bank needs its own EDC terminal, as can be seen in these pictures.

238
0:15:28,780 --> 0:15:34,380
 So whereas digital money stored in your bank can be mobilized using a plastic card, electronic

239
0:15:34,380 --> 0:15:40,340
 money, or e-money, was given a distinct legal definition in 2009 as a type of digital credit

240
0:15:40,340 --> 0:15:43,900
 balance issued and stored by a private actor.

241
0:15:43,900 --> 0:15:44,900
 E-money.

242
0:15:44,900 --> 0:15:45,780
 E-money.

243
0:15:45,780 --> 0:15:50,780
 E-money is issued based on the equivalent value of state-issued money deposited by a

244
0:15:50,780 --> 0:15:57,200
 holder to the issuer, the holder being the customer, the issuer being the companies.

245
0:15:57,200 --> 0:16:01,800
 It is stored electronically in a media such as a server or a chip.

246
0:16:01,800 --> 0:16:08,180
 It is used as a means of payment to a merchant, which could be a shop, cafe, or of course,

247
0:16:08,180 --> 0:16:09,180
 drivers.

248
0:16:09,180 --> 0:16:14,900
 E-money is what apps like Gojek and GoPay and OVO provide access to.

249
0:16:14,900 --> 0:16:22,360
 It's a type of debt that Gojek or OVO issue to you and which they repay you when you use

250
0:16:22,360 --> 0:16:28,680
 the app to pay one of their affiliated merchants, effectively by transferring your credit record

251
0:16:28,680 --> 0:16:35,700
 to the record of the merchant, after which it can be withdrawn again as cash.

252
0:16:35,700 --> 0:16:38,980
 While the use of e-money has been rapidly increasing these past years, as can be seen

253
0:16:38,980 --> 0:16:44,700
 to the left, it's worth noting that despite all of the hype of, like, mobile-based transactions,

254
0:16:44,700 --> 0:16:50,100
 the amount of money being transacted in this way pales in comparison to the more conventional

255
0:16:50,100 --> 0:16:52,720
 uses of ATM or debit transactions.

256
0:16:52,720 --> 0:16:57,200
 Just so we really manifest, hype is hype.

257
0:16:57,200 --> 0:17:03,900
 So, when the discourse surrounding digital payments emphasizes the phrase cashless or

258
0:17:03,900 --> 0:17:08,720
 less cash, as advocated by the Indonesian government, we obscure what it is that these

259
0:17:08,720 --> 0:17:12,540
 cash transactions are being replaced by.

260
0:17:12,540 --> 0:17:13,540
 As digitalization draws attention to the importance of cash, it's also important to note that

261
0:17:13,540 --> 0:17:14,540
 the use of e-money is not necessarily the same as cash transactions.

262
0:17:14,540 --> 0:17:18,780
 In addition to the underlying infrastructures of money, particularly the concept of payments

263
0:17:18,780 --> 0:17:22,240
 has received renewed academic attention.

264
0:17:22,240 --> 0:17:27,100
 When you make a digital payment, what you're doing is requesting the entity which keeps

265
0:17:27,100 --> 0:17:31,460
 your record of accounts to alter that record and the record of the person that you are

266
0:17:31,460 --> 0:17:33,440
 making the payment to.

267
0:17:33,440 --> 0:17:38,780
 This generally takes place through banks and various third-party payment processors.

268
0:17:38,780 --> 0:17:44,040
 Thus, what happens in a cashless or less cash society is essentialization.

269
0:17:44,040 --> 0:17:48,780
 It's the centralization of control over payment infrastructure.

270
0:17:48,780 --> 0:17:55,080
 Where cash can be considered a public, state-issued social infrastructure, digital payments are

271
0:17:55,080 --> 0:17:59,140
 generally the domain of private entities.

272
0:17:59,140 --> 0:18:03,940
 Though the money transacted through the Gojek app may be denominated in the state-issued

273
0:18:03,940 --> 0:18:08,980
 Indonesian rupiah, the tokens are contained within and transported through their private

274
0:18:08,980 --> 0:18:09,980
 infrastructure.

275
0:18:09,980 --> 0:18:12,880
 Thus, these apps not only determine the price to be paid for their services, but also determine

276
0:18:12,880 --> 0:18:13,880
 the price to be paid for their services.

277
0:18:13,880 --> 0:18:19,640
 But the price of payment itself, as we will see shortly.

278
0:18:19,640 --> 0:18:24,800
 For the intermediaries processing these digital payments, the value in providing payment infrastructure

279
0:18:24,800 --> 0:18:27,040
 shifted with digitalization.

280
0:18:27,040 --> 0:18:32,200
 From imposing fees or rent in exchange for the service of physically moving money, to

281
0:18:32,200 --> 0:18:35,820
 the value of the transactional metadata itself.

282
0:18:35,820 --> 0:18:40,240
 So when I purchase things through the Gojek app, I let the app and its owners know where

283
0:18:40,240 --> 0:18:42,820
 I like to shop, what I like to buy, what my transport routes are, and what I want to buy.

284
0:18:42,820 --> 0:18:51,300
 Where cash is anonymous and usable only by whoever is holding it, digital money becomes

285
0:18:51,300 --> 0:18:53,820
 hyper-personalized.

286
0:18:53,820 --> 0:18:59,160
 The digitalization of money has facilitated this unprecedented aggregation of transactional

287
0:18:59,160 --> 0:19:00,160
 metadata.

288
0:19:00,160 --> 0:19:06,340
 Thus, to quote economic anthropologist Bell Maurer, for intermediaries, the dream is for

289
0:19:06,340 --> 0:19:11,660
 a system where value enters a network, circulates endlessly, never leaving as material cash.

290
0:19:11,660 --> 0:19:12,660
 The goal of the Gojek app is to create a system where value enters a network, circulates endlessly,

291
0:19:12,660 --> 0:19:15,500
 never leaving as material cash.

292
0:19:15,500 --> 0:19:19,580
 For Gojek, the self-declared goal is to become a super app.

293
0:19:19,580 --> 0:19:25,200
 An app that provides for all of a customer's wants and needs by hosting other apps within

294
0:19:25,200 --> 0:19:28,200
 the overarching umbrella of a single platform.

295
0:19:28,200 --> 0:19:32,040
 As the head of the Gojek data engineering team writes on the company blog, the biggest

296
0:19:32,040 --> 0:19:34,660
 moat Gojek ever built is payments.

297
0:19:34,660 --> 0:19:39,300
 Once you're handling money for a user, you can build a castle of services within it.

298
0:19:39,300 --> 0:19:40,300
 The moat...

299
0:19:40,300 --> 0:19:41,760
 This is not his quote.

300
0:19:41,760 --> 0:19:42,800
 This is me now.

301
0:19:42,800 --> 0:19:48,360
 The moat is comprised of the digital credits issued privately through the GoPay wallet.

302
0:19:48,360 --> 0:19:53,560
 Purchased using Indonesian rupiah, these GoPay credits can be used exclusively for services

303
0:19:53,560 --> 0:19:55,760
 within the Gojek platform.

304
0:19:55,760 --> 0:20:01,360
 Thus, it is Gojek that controls the metaphorical drawbridge which both gives access to and

305
0:20:01,360 --> 0:20:06,600
 confines money, services, and people within the moat boundaries.

306
0:20:06,600 --> 0:20:10,600
 So, it's this expansion.

307
0:20:10,600 --> 0:20:16,600
 Expansion from a ride-hailing app into the center of our social economic exchange practices

308
0:20:16,600 --> 0:20:22,880
 and the subsequent dynamics that these platforms introduce to the circulation of value that

309
0:20:22,880 --> 0:20:25,400
 deserves increased scrutiny.

310
0:20:25,400 --> 0:20:29,480
 Where cash can be exchanged from one hand to another, digital money requires a little

311
0:20:29,480 --> 0:20:36,400
 more infrastructural support, such as QR codes or the EDC terminals we saw earlier.

312
0:20:36,400 --> 0:20:39,640
 And much of this infrastructure is rendered invisible by design.

313
0:20:39,640 --> 0:20:44,840
 Thus, allowing users to, famously, pay without hassle, the underlying infrastructures become

314
0:20:44,840 --> 0:20:47,520
 concealed within these frictionless aesthetics.

315
0:20:47,520 --> 0:20:53,820
 So, let's go for a little walk inside this friction- and hassle-free castle.

316
0:20:53,820 --> 0:20:58,180
 When you open either the Gojek or Grab app, this is the home screen that greets you.

317
0:20:58,180 --> 0:21:02,380
 In both apps, the digital wallet appears as a menu bar at the top of the screen, which

318
0:21:02,380 --> 0:21:05,800
 shows you your balance, denominated in rupiah.

319
0:21:05,800 --> 0:21:08,640
 The menu allows you to top up or make payments.

320
0:21:08,640 --> 0:21:09,640
 And lures you to the top of the screen.

321
0:21:09,640 --> 0:21:12,820
 And lures you in with the promise of more features.

322
0:21:12,820 --> 0:21:16,960
 Only to reveal that you have to be a premium user to access features like withdrawing your

323
0:21:16,960 --> 0:21:19,520
 money or sending money to other people.

324
0:21:19,520 --> 0:21:25,820
 Thus, for regular users, money stored in the app can only exit again in the form of payment.

325
0:21:25,820 --> 0:21:31,360
 Only through consumerism can you use this money for anything.

326
0:21:31,360 --> 0:21:35,900
 If you want to top up your balance, the app specifically asks you to make a payment using

327
0:21:35,900 --> 0:21:37,260
 a debit card.

328
0:21:37,260 --> 0:21:38,640
 In other words, you are buying GoPay credits.

329
0:21:38,640 --> 0:21:44,660
 Not unlike how you would buy a gift card for a very favorite shop.

330
0:21:44,660 --> 0:21:49,160
 And for those without a debit card or a bank account, remember, not everyone has those,

331
0:21:49,160 --> 0:21:54,480
 the app provides very detailed instructions for a variety of alternative top-up methods.

332
0:21:54,480 --> 0:21:58,520
 First and foremost, suggesting that you ask your driver for a top-up, which is also the

333
0:21:58,520 --> 0:22:02,660
 only free way to do so.

334
0:22:02,660 --> 0:22:07,700
 As a customer, the main way to interact with this digital wallet is when the app asks you

335
0:22:07,700 --> 0:22:11,040
 to select a payment method for in-app purchases.

336
0:22:11,040 --> 0:22:15,240
 So in these images, we see me selecting a payment method for a car booking I made in

337
0:22:15,240 --> 0:22:16,600
 the Grab app.

338
0:22:16,600 --> 0:22:20,980
 To the left is the price if I chose OVO, the digital credit.

339
0:22:20,980 --> 0:22:24,760
 As I don't have enough OVO, I have to select the cash option.

340
0:22:24,760 --> 0:22:30,940
 Noticeably, the price changes from 4 to 20,000 rupiah.

341
0:22:30,940 --> 0:22:36,440
 The interface design also deploys color, using green to show how good and cheap the digital

342
0:22:36,440 --> 0:22:37,700
 payment option is.

343
0:22:37,700 --> 0:22:46,580
 Even worse, having selected cash, a red notification bar appears at the top of the screen, reminding

344
0:22:46,580 --> 0:22:51,580
 me that I'll be missing out on an 80% discount for not choosing OVO.

345
0:22:51,580 --> 0:22:57,100
 Thus, the presence of the digital payment option is not presented as a convenient or

346
0:22:57,100 --> 0:23:01,140
 neutral alternative to making a cash payment.

347
0:23:01,140 --> 0:23:05,880
 And this is just one example of how both of these apps aggressively encourage users to

348
0:23:05,880 --> 0:23:06,880
 pay digitally.

349
0:23:06,880 --> 0:23:13,200
 There's a point that one almost comes to feel punished for choosing cash.

350
0:23:13,200 --> 0:23:16,080
 And this affects how people use the apps.

351
0:23:16,080 --> 0:23:20,480
 So by 2019, I was constantly comparing discounts across apps.

352
0:23:20,480 --> 0:23:24,960
 I found myself taking every opportunity to ensure that my accounts were topped up to

353
0:23:24,960 --> 0:23:29,380
 avoid feeling as though I was missing out on a cheaper trip and thus wasting my money.

354
0:23:29,380 --> 0:23:34,280
 And similarly, for most of the people I interviewed, the real value proposition of e-money was

355
0:23:34,280 --> 0:23:35,760
 not the fact that it's digital.

356
0:23:35,760 --> 0:23:36,760
 It's the actual value proposition.

357
0:23:36,760 --> 0:23:42,380
 It's the ability of this particular form of money to give access to cheaper services

358
0:23:42,380 --> 0:23:43,940
 and products.

359
0:23:43,940 --> 0:23:49,120
 What the apps primarily give is an access point for the type of purchases that are associated

360
0:23:49,120 --> 0:23:51,080
 with a middle class life.

361
0:23:51,080 --> 0:23:55,680
 Personal drivers, discounted food delivery, cashbacks when shopping at the mall, like

362
0:23:55,680 --> 0:23:59,440
 this restaurant, where three different apps are encouraging you to use their particular

363
0:23:59,440 --> 0:24:05,800
 form of payment with absolutely wild cashbacks.

364
0:24:05,800 --> 0:24:09,020
 So how do drivers fit into this whole digital money ecosystem?

365
0:24:09,020 --> 0:24:14,880
 So let me begin by describing one of my absolutely earliest encounters with some unexpected transactional

366
0:24:14,880 --> 0:24:17,640
 frictions in 2018.

367
0:24:17,640 --> 0:24:21,440
 I had just downloaded the Gojek app and I had topped up my GoPay wallet and was trying

368
0:24:21,440 --> 0:24:25,380
 to use the money to pay for a cappuccino in a neighborhood coffee shop.

369
0:24:25,380 --> 0:24:31,920
 A barista told me when I asked if I could pay for my order with GoPay, you can't yet.

370
0:24:31,920 --> 0:24:34,800
 I had selected this coffee shop from my neighborhood.

371
0:24:34,800 --> 0:24:39,780
 Because I had seen it listed in the GoFood section of the Gojek app, and so I had assumed

372
0:24:39,780 --> 0:24:43,220
 that the digital wallet would be an acceptable form of payment.

373
0:24:43,220 --> 0:24:47,000
 The coffee shop only accepted cash, the barista explained.

374
0:24:47,000 --> 0:24:52,100
 But if I wanted to use GoPay, there was a way of doing so.

375
0:24:52,100 --> 0:24:57,560
 I could make an order for my coffee using the GoFood tab in the Gojek app and select

376
0:24:57,560 --> 0:25:01,320
 the digital payment option rather than cash upon checkout.

377
0:25:01,320 --> 0:25:04,120
 A driver would receive my order.

378
0:25:04,120 --> 0:25:08,140
 Drive to the cafe, place the order, wait for it to be prepared, and then pay for it

379
0:25:08,140 --> 0:25:10,740
 using their own cash.

380
0:25:10,740 --> 0:25:14,220
 The driver would then bring me the coffee and be paid for the cost of the coffee and

381
0:25:14,220 --> 0:25:18,440
 his time using my GoPay balance.

382
0:25:18,440 --> 0:25:23,980
 This was my first encounter with the entanglements of online drivers and digital money in Indonesia,

383
0:25:23,980 --> 0:25:28,860
 and my very first confounding experience of the peculiar limitations and opportunities

384
0:25:28,860 --> 0:25:33,480
 for transaction that had materialized just through the interfaces of these apps.

385
0:25:34,120 --> 0:25:40,300
 When I started using these apps in 2018, I assumed that drivers and customers shared

386
0:25:40,300 --> 0:25:44,420
 if not the same, at least a similar type of digital wallet infrastructure.

387
0:25:44,420 --> 0:25:47,760
 After all, I was paying with my GoPay wallet, it seemed natural to assume that they were

388
0:25:47,760 --> 0:25:50,300
 receiving it in their GoPay wallet.

389
0:25:50,300 --> 0:25:55,300
 In practice, drivers use a separate app entirely, and it contains three digital wallets, as

390
0:25:55,300 --> 0:25:57,340
 can be seen in this image.

391
0:25:57,340 --> 0:26:02,200
 There is a credit wallet, from which the company extracts their 20% cut of income on trips paid with GoPay.

392
0:26:02,200 --> 0:26:03,200
 There is a credit wallet, from which the company extracts their 20% cut of income on trips paid with GoPay.

393
0:26:03,200 --> 0:26:04,120
 There is a credit wallet, from which the company extracts their 20% cut of income on trips paid with GoPay.

394
0:26:04,120 --> 0:26:16,860
 And finally, there's a consumer wallet, GoPay for Gojek drivers and Ovo for Grab drivers,

395
0:26:16,860 --> 0:26:21,180
 to which they can then transfer their earnings directly and then use it through the consumer

396
0:26:21,180 --> 0:26:25,960
 version of the apps, which some drivers do, meaning they can literally just put the money

397
0:26:25,960 --> 0:26:30,900
 they've earned directly into the consumer wallet and also spend it on things.

398
0:26:30,900 --> 0:26:33,200
 Very convenient infrastructure.

399
0:26:33,200 --> 0:26:40,040
 For income to be useful for drivers, they have to make a request to the app to cash out their balance.

400
0:26:40,720 --> 0:26:45,240
 The company then debits their account and transfers money to the driver's bank account.

401
0:26:45,680 --> 0:26:49,960
 And only then can the drivers withdraw the money as cash at an ATM.

402
0:26:51,180 --> 0:26:57,880
 Notably, this means that contrary to customers, all drivers must have a bank account to use these apps.

403
0:26:57,880 --> 0:27:06,440
 And if they don't have one, Gojek provides them with one through their partnership with Bank Sentral Asia, the largest privately owned bank in Indonesia.

404
0:27:07,360 --> 0:27:13,880
 Truly, banking the unbanked in order for the customer to experience hassle-free and heavily discounted cashless payments.

405
0:27:16,120 --> 0:27:22,340
 When a driver tops up a customer balance, they're selling their own digital balance and receiving cash in exchange.

406
0:27:22,700 --> 0:27:27,400
 The apps incentivize drivers to do this either by awarding them points,

407
0:27:27,400 --> 0:27:33,620
 which count towards their daily bonus targets, or by giving them a digital cashback of up to 20% of what they sold.

408
0:27:34,200 --> 0:27:39,260
 As you can see here, where the driver has received 4,000 as a bonus for completing a top-up.

409
0:27:40,040 --> 0:27:44,840
 One driver proudly shared that he would nudge customers to buy a top-up,

410
0:27:45,280 --> 0:27:51,740
 securing himself cashbacks of up to 100,000 to 150,000 per day just for selling his balance,

411
0:27:52,240 --> 0:27:56,100
 implying sales of between 500,000 to 750,000 each day.

412
0:27:56,840 --> 0:27:57,360
 Curious.

413
0:27:57,860 --> 0:28:02,900
 I asked the driver what his strategy was for maintaining such high liquidity in his digital account.

414
0:28:03,500 --> 0:28:11,340
 He argued that for the most part, it wasn't a problem since customers were constantly replenishing his account by paying through OVO just as I had done for this trip.

415
0:28:12,320 --> 0:28:17,920
 Incidentally, I had just asked him for a top-up equivalent exactly to the cost of the trip itself,

416
0:28:18,420 --> 0:28:22,680
 because as described earlier, I too was concerned with maintaining a digital balance.

417
0:28:24,080 --> 0:28:27,160
 I had made a 20,000 cashless payment using OVO

418
0:28:27,400 --> 0:28:35,640
 and I was able to use the same amount of cash to replenish my digital account in preparation for my next trip.

419
0:28:37,640 --> 0:28:43,840
 As a reward for selling his OVO balance to me, the driver later receives 4,000 as a cashback to his digital wallet.

420
0:28:45,500 --> 0:28:51,120
 From the driver's point of view, he had received my digital payment and then sold me the exact same amount back,

421
0:28:51,620 --> 0:28:56,700
 receiving 20,000 cash in exchange, but also receiving this digital 4,000 from the company.

422
0:28:57,400 --> 0:29:00,240
 In total, the driver earned 24,000 rupiah.

423
0:29:00,900 --> 0:29:08,400
 But in the process, he also managed to convert 20,000 of his existing balance into the more useful form of cash.

424
0:29:09,840 --> 0:29:13,780
 The irony of this cash-filled cashless transaction was not lost on the driver.

425
0:29:14,440 --> 0:29:16,240
 He laughed.

426
0:29:16,660 --> 0:29:17,560
 Money goes around.

427
0:29:18,840 --> 0:29:21,020
 It wasn't an atypical exchange, he explained.

428
0:29:21,100 --> 0:29:27,040
 Like me, many passengers chose to top up on each booking, opting for smaller and more frequent top-ups,

429
0:29:27,040 --> 0:29:29,400
 rather than maintaining a large digital balance.

430
0:29:31,400 --> 0:29:37,900
 So, for drivers, selling balance to customers represents a really important alternative way to cash out

431
0:29:37,900 --> 0:29:42,580
 because accessing an ATM can be quite inconvenient.

432
0:29:42,960 --> 0:29:47,400
 By selling their balance, drivers instantly convert digital assets into cash

433
0:29:47,400 --> 0:29:51,080
 without having to wait for the transfer to be processed by the system.

434
0:29:51,560 --> 0:29:56,380
 Meanwhile, the e-money tokens continue circulating within the system,

435
0:29:56,380 --> 0:30:03,560
 company doesn't have to make any bank transfers at all. So operating on the front lines of

436
0:30:03,560 --> 0:30:08,640
 the digital economy, these drivers are doing all of the persuasive work of bringing new

437
0:30:08,640 --> 0:30:13,420
 customers into the digital payment ecosystem of these apps on behalf of the companies they're

438
0:30:13,420 --> 0:30:20,540
 working for. Drivers are converted into on-the-go digital ATMs for customers, but they also

439
0:30:20,540 --> 0:30:27,300
 use customers as an on-the-go cash ATM for themselves. Because drivers need cash. And

440
0:30:27,300 --> 0:30:33,100
 therefore, it is they who incur the hassle of having to rematerialize digital money into

441
0:30:33,100 --> 0:30:39,860
 cash. Thus, in this system, drivers are the ones who take on the frictions, the risks,

442
0:30:39,860 --> 0:30:46,600
 and the transaction costs of facilitating a hassle-free digital payment ecosystem. And

443
0:30:46,600 --> 0:30:50,540
 this becomes particularly clear if we examine the moment of topping up and

444
0:30:50,540 --> 0:30:56,100
 in more detail. So these screenshots show a top-up transaction that I had with a Grab

445
0:30:56,100 --> 0:31:01,160
 driver. Once my booking is accepted by the driver, the app covers most of the map with

446
0:31:01,160 --> 0:31:05,680
 an unclosable splash screen with a dominating green button encouraging me to top up my balance

447
0:31:05,680 --> 0:31:10,420
 with the driver. Fine. After clicking the button, the next screen informs me that I

448
0:31:10,420 --> 0:31:15,780
 can request between 10 to 320,000 rupiah from the driver, and it gives me the option to

449
0:31:15,780 --> 0:31:20,320
 enter a figure. The app now shows me this comforting image with a sparkling green check

450
0:31:20,320 --> 0:31:27,100
 mark. My request has been successfully submitted. In the car, the driver reaches for his phone,

451
0:31:27,100 --> 0:31:30,680
 and almost instantly, a new splash screen appears on my screen, telling me that the

452
0:31:30,680 --> 0:31:36,880
 top-up has been successful, and I hand the cash to the driver. But there are a few things

453
0:31:36,880 --> 0:31:43,060
 that the customer does not see in this transaction. Firstly, when the app tells me how much money

454
0:31:43,060 --> 0:31:47,860
 I can request, the number it's showing me is the entire contents of the driver's digital

455
0:31:47,860 --> 0:31:49,860
 cash wallet. Secondly, the app's request is not always complete. The app simply knows

456
0:31:49,860 --> 0:31:50,320
 the total amount of cash on the driver's digital cash wallet. The image that the app lends to the quoting is the same as

457
0:31:51,040 --> 0:31:54,640
 The driver does not actually have the option to decline this transaction.

458
0:31:56,920 --> 0:32:04,680
 In the driver version of the app, the splash screen that appears gives him simply the option to click a similar green button that reads, collect money.

459
0:32:06,100 --> 0:32:08,700
 The button doesn't even say confirm transaction.

460
0:32:09,100 --> 0:32:12,300
 Once requested by the customer, the transaction is inevitable.

461
0:32:12,960 --> 0:32:14,940
 There's no meaningful agency here for the driver.

462
0:32:16,700 --> 0:32:19,420
 And such design may not have any malicious intent.

463
0:32:20,320 --> 0:32:30,480
 But it reflects neglect, revealing that the contents of a digital wallet do not truly belong to the driver until they've been withdrawn as cash.

464
0:32:31,320 --> 0:32:37,440
 Instead, the wallet is there to enable customers to access and make use of company-issued digital credit.

465
0:32:39,220 --> 0:32:49,360
 So, having examined how payments and digital money work in practice, let's shift our focus finally to how the apps arrange the customers and drivers,

466
0:32:49,840 --> 0:32:50,300
 configuring them.

467
0:32:50,520 --> 0:32:53,300
 into these roles of consumer cyborg and driver partner.

468
0:32:54,720 --> 0:33:04,840
 To begin, let's zoom out from this particular castle for a moment with its moats and examine some of the arguments perpetuated by the financial technology industry in the promotion of these products.

469
0:33:08,140 --> 0:33:12,240
 Let me summarize these quotes that are about or from the Indonesian fintech industry.

470
0:33:12,840 --> 0:33:19,840
 Publicly, these companies perpetually make the argument that their financial technologies will lead to financial problems.

471
0:33:19,840 --> 0:33:29,080
 But what about the financial inclusion of those who are unbanked, by bringing millions of people into the digital economy as members of a cashless society?

472
0:33:29,960 --> 0:33:35,880
 And globally, this is a really dominating narrative surrounding the type of P2P payments we're talking about.

473
0:33:36,600 --> 0:33:43,800
 And it's an outcome of a global paradigm shift that led to perceiving the world's poor as a new and exciting market opportunity.

474
0:33:45,000 --> 0:33:49,240
 And these arguments are frequently mobilized in favor of expanding private money services.

475
0:33:49,240 --> 0:34:01,120
 Often with support from national governments, as is the case of Gojek and the Indonesian state, which the founder of Gojek is now a member of, because he's become the minister of culture and education.

476
0:34:02,960 --> 0:34:13,520
 It's presumed that by giving a poor person access to financial services or to selling their products and services on such a platform, that they will be able to generate income and thus lift themselves out of poverty.

477
0:34:14,000 --> 0:34:19,000
 But this ignores the complex structural dynamics that lead to socioeconomic equality.

478
0:34:19,240 --> 0:34:23,520
 Such as the increasing income and wealth disparities in Indonesia.

479
0:34:24,560 --> 0:34:36,640
 And a similar logic casts ascendance to the middle class as a personal responsibility, which in turn construes being afflicted by poverty as a personal failing.

480
0:34:37,440 --> 0:34:48,080
 And these are stigmatizing moral judgments, which lead to the legitimization of exploitation of those deemed less financially responsible or less diligent.

481
0:34:49,240 --> 0:34:57,720
 A critical thing to remember is that participation in a cashless economy is not a universal experience.

482
0:34:58,840 --> 0:35:04,400
 A technology that makes life more convenient for some can greatly complicate the lives of others.

483
0:35:05,080 --> 0:35:16,480
 In practice, these Indonesian apps reproduce specific ideas about consumption that are at odds with the visions of the marginalized and unbanked populations that these same actors argue that their apps will benefit.

484
0:35:17,280 --> 0:35:18,560
 They reveal a certain positionality of the consumer.

485
0:35:18,560 --> 0:35:19,040
 They reveal a certain positionality of the consumer.

486
0:35:19,040 --> 0:35:19,200
 They reveal a certain positionality of the consumer.

487
0:35:19,200 --> 0:35:19,220
 They reveal a certain positionality of the consumer.

488
0:35:19,240 --> 0:35:19,740
 They reveal a certain positionality of the consumer.

489
0:35:20,240 --> 0:35:22,740
 They reveal a certain positionality of both their developers, their investors, and their imagined consumers.

490
0:35:22,860 --> 0:35:27,860
 Particularly, these visions reproduce ideas about the modern Indonesian middle class lifestyle.

491
0:35:28,600 --> 0:35:35,740
 And the type of aspirational consumerism that can demarcate you as having these forms of social capital.

492
0:35:35,740 --> 0:35:40,000
 And as illustrated in this wonderful Gojek advertisement for their new Pay Later service.

493
0:35:40,400 --> 0:35:47,400
 It's worth noting that a central component of how the middle class constitutes itself is through the employment of others.

494
0:35:47,400 --> 0:35:49,560
 publicly demonstrating the forms of affluence

495
0:35:49,560 --> 0:35:52,260
 that allow them to pay others to do things for them.

496
0:35:54,480 --> 0:35:57,740
 Driver partners, notably, are not employed by these apps.

497
0:35:57,980 --> 0:35:59,980
 They're mobilized in service of the customers

498
0:35:59,980 --> 0:36:01,700
 and, by extension, the digital economy.

499
0:36:02,420 --> 0:36:03,800
 And as I point out in my research,

500
0:36:04,540 --> 0:36:07,680
 the loosely organized drivers were previously known as OJEC

501
0:36:07,680 --> 0:36:11,120
 and simply existed long before there was ever GOJEC.

502
0:36:11,900 --> 0:36:13,420
 What these companies have done

503
0:36:13,420 --> 0:36:17,760
 is impose themselves on an existing social infrastructure

504
0:36:17,760 --> 0:36:22,140
 and provided customers with an easily interpretable interface for engagement.

505
0:36:23,000 --> 0:36:27,680
 And in doing so, their platforms create momentary stabilizing parameters for exchange,

506
0:36:28,020 --> 0:36:30,020
 thus controlling the conditions of transaction

507
0:36:30,020 --> 0:36:32,520
 that were already taking place before they arrived.

508
0:36:33,900 --> 0:36:36,940
 Proponents of the gig economy and those forms of digital capitalism

509
0:36:36,940 --> 0:36:40,920
 often argue that this is a type of labor that makes workers more flexible,

510
0:36:41,380 --> 0:36:43,260
 more able to exert control

511
0:36:43,260 --> 0:36:44,060
 over their lives.

512
0:36:44,680 --> 0:36:46,660
 But in practice, with GOJEC and GRAB,

513
0:36:47,260 --> 0:36:50,660
 anyone can easily and flexibly employ a temporary servant,

514
0:36:51,460 --> 0:36:54,000
 perpetuating what scholars like Ray and Kayum conceptualize

515
0:36:54,000 --> 0:36:55,200
 as cultures of servitude,

516
0:36:55,960 --> 0:36:59,180
 social relations of domination and subordination,

517
0:36:59,580 --> 0:37:02,300
 through which subsequent dependency and inequality

518
0:37:02,300 --> 0:37:04,500
 are normalized and reproduced

519
0:37:04,500 --> 0:37:06,380
 through these everyday social interactions.

520
0:37:08,280 --> 0:37:10,380
 And this division in who is being served

521
0:37:10,380 --> 0:37:12,840
 and who is doing the serving is most eloquently expressed

522
0:37:12,840 --> 0:37:13,240
 by GOJEC.

523
0:37:13,260 --> 0:37:15,260
 GOJEC's founder, Nadiem Makarim, himself.

524
0:37:15,920 --> 0:37:19,920
 During a 2019 fireside chat at an industry event in Bali,

525
0:37:19,920 --> 0:37:21,920
 Makarim makes a really interesting observation

526
0:37:21,920 --> 0:37:23,920
 about the app he helped create,

527
0:37:23,920 --> 0:37:24,920
 calling GOJEC the

528
0:37:24,920 --> 0:37:26,920
 operating system of the real world.

529
0:37:27,960 --> 0:37:28,960
 Makarim elaborates,

530
0:37:29,600 --> 0:37:31,600
 you're creating a cyborg in our consumers

531
0:37:31,600 --> 0:37:34,600
 that are able to not have to do the things they don't want to do

532
0:37:34,600 --> 0:37:37,600
 and therefore have more time to get stuff done in life.

533
0:37:38,960 --> 0:37:40,960
 Implicit here is the logic of automation,

534
0:37:40,960 --> 0:37:42,960
 which reduces time being spent on a process.

535
0:37:43,260 --> 0:37:45,260
 Through this automation,

536
0:37:45,260 --> 0:37:47,260
 the app, the phone, and the driver

537
0:37:47,260 --> 0:37:49,260
 who's tasked with doing those things for you

538
0:37:49,260 --> 0:37:51,260
 all become part of your extended cyborg self.

539
0:37:51,260 --> 0:37:53,260
 It's interesting that the emphasis here

540
0:37:53,260 --> 0:37:55,260
 is on how the app can serve those similar to Makarim himself.

541
0:37:55,260 --> 0:37:57,260
 His emphasis on productivity, efficiency,

542
0:37:57,260 --> 0:37:59,260
 on not having to waste your time

543
0:37:59,260 --> 0:38:01,260
 when someone else can waste theirs for you,

544
0:38:01,260 --> 0:38:03,260
 feels remarkably revealing of his world view

545
0:38:03,260 --> 0:38:05,260
 and his orientation as one of the app's consumer cyborgs.

546
0:38:05,260 --> 0:38:07,260
 And characterizing what problem he feels GOJEC has

547
0:38:07,260 --> 0:38:09,260
 is the fact that he's not just a consumer cyborg,

548
0:38:09,260 --> 0:38:11,260
 he's also a consumer cyborg.

549
0:38:11,260 --> 0:38:13,260
 And characterizing what problem he feels GOJEC has,

550
0:38:13,260 --> 0:38:15,260
 what GOJEC is trying to solve in the world, Makarim says.

551
0:38:15,260 --> 0:38:17,260
 It was simply a problem of mobility, right?

552
0:38:17,260 --> 0:38:19,260
 How do you get a human, an object,

553
0:38:19,260 --> 0:38:21,260
 like food, or money, or value,

554
0:38:21,260 --> 0:38:23,260
 to move in the fastest possible,

555
0:38:23,260 --> 0:38:25,260
 cheapest, most convenient way,

556
0:38:25,260 --> 0:38:27,260
 using one tool?

557
0:38:27,260 --> 0:38:29,260
 His answer is the app.

558
0:38:29,260 --> 0:38:31,260
 But the app does not result

559
0:38:31,260 --> 0:38:33,260
 in the rapid, cheap, and convenient circulation

560
0:38:33,260 --> 0:38:35,260
 of people, objects, and value.

561
0:38:35,260 --> 0:38:37,260
 That circulation is facilitated

562
0:38:37,260 --> 0:38:39,260
 by the human labor performed

563
0:38:39,260 --> 0:38:41,260
 by the driver partners.

564
0:38:41,260 --> 0:38:43,260
 So when Makarim uses language,

565
0:38:43,260 --> 0:38:45,260
 such as cyborg or operating system of the world,

566
0:38:45,260 --> 0:38:47,260
 he foregrounds the technological innovation

567
0:38:47,260 --> 0:38:49,260
 and reinforces the idea

568
0:38:49,260 --> 0:38:51,260
 of seamless automated processes

569
0:38:51,260 --> 0:38:53,260
 by which this circulation takes place

570
0:38:53,260 --> 0:38:55,260
 almost magically.

571
0:38:57,260 --> 0:38:59,260
 And GOJEC and GRAB are not the only companies

572
0:38:59,260 --> 0:39:01,260
 that refer to their fleets of drivers

573
0:39:01,260 --> 0:39:03,260
 as driver partner,

574
0:39:03,260 --> 0:39:05,260
 a title that demarcates a different type of relationship

575
0:39:05,260 --> 0:39:07,260
 than someone employed to work for the company.

576
0:39:07,260 --> 0:39:09,260
 It was not uncommon for drivers

577
0:39:09,260 --> 0:39:11,260
 to express their discontent with these conditions

578
0:39:11,260 --> 0:39:13,260
 of the alleged partnership.

579
0:39:13,260 --> 0:39:15,260
 They were partners with the app company

580
0:39:15,260 --> 0:39:17,260
 who relied on each other for income,

581
0:39:17,260 --> 0:39:19,260
 yet they were not equal parties.

582
0:39:19,260 --> 0:39:21,260
 When drivers sign up,

583
0:39:21,260 --> 0:39:23,260
 they accept the terms and conditions

584
0:39:23,260 --> 0:39:25,260
 that come with working as an online driver.

585
0:39:25,260 --> 0:39:27,260
 However, as many have pointed out,

586
0:39:27,260 --> 0:39:29,260
 those conditions frequently change

587
0:39:29,260 --> 0:39:31,260
 without warning or consultation with the drivers.

588
0:39:31,260 --> 0:39:33,260
 There is no two-way negotiation.

589
0:39:33,260 --> 0:39:35,260
 They experience that the apps define them

590
0:39:35,260 --> 0:39:37,260
 as on-demand robots,

591
0:39:37,260 --> 0:39:39,260
 their labor mobilized and channeled

592
0:39:39,260 --> 0:39:41,260
 through the app infrastructure

593
0:39:41,260 --> 0:39:43,260
 to serve the need of the consumer cyborgs.

594
0:39:43,260 --> 0:39:45,260
 The financial interests of the companies.

595
0:39:45,260 --> 0:39:47,260
 So as one driver responded

596
0:39:47,260 --> 0:39:49,260
 when I asked him what word he would use

597
0:39:49,260 --> 0:39:51,260
 instead of driver partner,

598
0:39:51,260 --> 0:39:53,260
 servant, probably.

599
0:39:53,260 --> 0:39:55,260
 In practice, the social relationships,

600
0:39:55,260 --> 0:39:57,260
 the alleged transactional peerhood

601
0:39:57,260 --> 0:39:59,260
 of these apps,

602
0:39:59,260 --> 0:40:01,260
 is heavily mediated by algorithms

603
0:40:01,260 --> 0:40:03,260
 which lead to the formation of new transactional hierarchies.

604
0:40:03,260 --> 0:40:05,260
 In the final chapter of my thesis,

605
0:40:05,260 --> 0:40:07,260
 I go into great detail

606
0:40:07,260 --> 0:40:09,260
 to document how drivers experience

607
0:40:09,260 --> 0:40:11,260
 being mobilized as on-demand servants

608
0:40:11,260 --> 0:40:13,260
 through these platforms.

609
0:40:13,260 --> 0:40:15,260
 First, driver income is calculated

610
0:40:15,260 --> 0:40:17,260
 by a set kilometer tariff

611
0:40:17,260 --> 0:40:19,260
 which does not include

612
0:40:19,260 --> 0:40:21,260
 distance to the customer

613
0:40:21,260 --> 0:40:23,260
 or time spent in traffic.

614
0:40:23,260 --> 0:40:25,260
 This is supplemented by a daily bonus

615
0:40:25,260 --> 0:40:27,260
 from the companies.

616
0:40:27,260 --> 0:40:29,260
 Drivers earn points for each completed trip,

617
0:40:29,260 --> 0:40:31,260
 hoping to reach the highest of three tiers

618
0:40:31,260 --> 0:40:33,260
 to reach the maximum bonus.

619
0:40:33,260 --> 0:40:35,260
 Critically,

620
0:40:35,260 --> 0:40:37,260
 drivers do not receive this bonus

621
0:40:37,260 --> 0:40:39,260
 if they cancel more than 25% of trips.

622
0:40:39,260 --> 0:40:41,260
 Though they may have good reasons

623
0:40:41,260 --> 0:40:43,260
 for doing so,

624
0:40:43,260 --> 0:40:45,260
 falling below the euphemistically titled

625
0:40:45,260 --> 0:40:47,260
 productivity rating

626
0:40:47,260 --> 0:40:49,260
 means that they incur what's called a debt trip,

627
0:40:49,260 --> 0:40:51,260
 meaning that they must complete

628
0:40:51,260 --> 0:40:53,260
 more orders in order to bring

629
0:40:53,260 --> 0:40:55,260
 the productivity rating up

630
0:40:55,260 --> 0:40:57,260
 while the company holds their bonus hostage.

631
0:40:57,260 --> 0:40:59,260
 Meanwhile,

632
0:40:59,260 --> 0:41:01,260
 customers are encouraged

633
0:41:01,260 --> 0:41:03,260
 to rate their experience after each trip.

634
0:41:03,260 --> 0:41:05,260
 So for the customer point of view,

635
0:41:05,260 --> 0:41:07,260
 rating a driver between one to five stars

636
0:41:07,260 --> 0:41:09,260
 is a question of a few millimeters

637
0:41:09,260 --> 0:41:11,260
 and a thumbswipe.

638
0:41:11,260 --> 0:41:13,260
 For drivers, this transaction is a source of constant anxiety

639
0:41:13,260 --> 0:41:15,260
 because less than five stars

640
0:41:15,260 --> 0:41:17,260
 will ruin their algorithmic ranking.

641
0:41:17,260 --> 0:41:19,260
 And many offer customers drinks or snacks

642
0:41:19,260 --> 0:41:21,260
 or engage in other forms of relational work

643
0:41:21,260 --> 0:41:23,260
 as a way to ensure these good ratings.

644
0:41:23,260 --> 0:41:25,260
 In a worst-case scenario,

645
0:41:25,260 --> 0:41:27,260
 a customer might give a driver

646
0:41:27,260 --> 0:41:29,260
 a one-star rating, leading to automatic suspension.

647
0:41:29,260 --> 0:41:31,260
 For drivers,

648
0:41:31,260 --> 0:41:33,260
 this can be a temporary or permanent loss of income.

649
0:41:33,260 --> 0:41:35,260
 But critically,

650
0:41:35,260 --> 0:41:37,260
 some drivers also pointed out

651
0:41:37,260 --> 0:41:39,260
 how it affects their access to the digital wallets

652
0:41:39,260 --> 0:41:41,260
 and their savings,

653
0:41:41,260 --> 0:41:43,260
 and how the app employs them.

654
0:41:45,260 --> 0:41:47,260
 And access to digital wallets of the app

655
0:41:47,260 --> 0:41:49,260
 is further complicated for those drivers

656
0:41:49,260 --> 0:41:51,260
 who rely on third-party account vendors

657
0:41:51,260 --> 0:41:53,260
 to register outside of the formal Go-Jek system.

658
0:41:53,260 --> 0:41:55,260
 I first became aware of vendors

659
0:41:55,260 --> 0:41:57,260
 when drivers would decline

660
0:41:57,260 --> 0:41:59,260
 selling me their balance,

661
0:41:59,260 --> 0:42:01,260
 saying there was no money

662
0:42:01,260 --> 0:42:03,260
 because they were with a vendor.

663
0:42:03,260 --> 0:42:05,260
 And what I came to realize

664
0:42:05,260 --> 0:42:07,260
 is that vendors manage fleets of drivers

665
0:42:07,260 --> 0:42:09,260
 with using an app infrastructure

666
0:42:09,260 --> 0:42:11,260
 provided by Go-Jek.

667
0:42:11,260 --> 0:42:13,260
 And digital earnings made by the drivers

668
0:42:13,260 --> 0:42:15,260
 have to be manually transferred

669
0:42:15,260 --> 0:42:17,260
 to the driver's bank account each day

670
0:42:17,260 --> 0:42:19,260
 by the vendor.

671
0:42:19,260 --> 0:42:21,260
 According to two employees of a vendor that I interviewed,

672
0:42:21,260 --> 0:42:23,260
 Go-Jek provides them with a window for transfers

673
0:42:23,260 --> 0:42:25,260
 through Monday and Friday

674
0:42:25,260 --> 0:42:27,260
 between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m.

675
0:42:27,260 --> 0:42:29,260
 With an estimated 250 active drivers

676
0:42:29,260 --> 0:42:31,260
 requiring daily transfers within a five-hour window,

677
0:42:31,260 --> 0:42:33,260
 the two employees only have

678
0:42:33,260 --> 0:42:35,260
 about 2.5 minutes each per driver.

679
0:42:35,260 --> 0:42:37,260
 So mistakes are pretty frequent.

680
0:42:37,260 --> 0:42:39,260
 And as they transfer these daily earnings,

681
0:42:39,260 --> 0:42:41,260
 they make sure to withdraw

682
0:42:41,260 --> 0:42:43,260
 their own 5% cut of these earnings, of course.

683
0:42:43,260 --> 0:42:45,260
 So there's this hierarchical difference

684
0:42:45,260 --> 0:42:47,260
 not just in income,

685
0:42:47,260 --> 0:42:49,260
 but also access to and control over earnings

686
0:42:49,260 --> 0:42:51,260
 between those drivers

687
0:42:51,260 --> 0:42:53,260
 who are registered directly with Go-Jek

688
0:42:53,260 --> 0:42:55,260
 and those who rely on the additional

689
0:42:55,260 --> 0:42:57,260
 intermediation of vendors.

690
0:42:57,260 --> 0:42:59,260
 More critically,

691
0:42:59,260 --> 0:43:01,260
 in March 2019,

692
0:43:01,260 --> 0:43:03,260
 Go-Jek codified a system of unequal pay

693
0:43:03,260 --> 0:43:05,260
 as go-car drivers woke up

694
0:43:05,260 --> 0:43:07,260
 to an in-app notification

695
0:43:07,260 --> 0:43:09,260
 of a change to the incentive-bonus system

696
0:43:09,260 --> 0:43:11,260
 which radically worsened their conditions for labor.

697
0:43:11,260 --> 0:43:13,260
 Go-Jek replaced the standard

698
0:43:13,260 --> 0:43:15,260
 three-tier bonus scale

699
0:43:15,260 --> 0:43:17,260
 with a system using four different scales

700
0:43:17,260 --> 0:43:19,260
 known as schemas A, B, C, and D.

701
0:43:19,260 --> 0:43:21,260
 Briefly, schema A

702
0:43:21,260 --> 0:43:23,260
 required fewer points

703
0:43:23,260 --> 0:43:25,260
 and therefore fewer completed trips

704
0:43:25,260 --> 0:43:27,260
 per tier, but also reduced

705
0:43:27,260 --> 0:43:29,260
 the maximum bonus they could earn.

706
0:43:29,260 --> 0:43:31,260
 Whereas schema D required more points

707
0:43:31,260 --> 0:43:33,260
 but gave the highest maximum bonus.

708
0:43:33,260 --> 0:43:35,260
 Which schema each driver is assigned

709
0:43:35,260 --> 0:43:37,260
 was determined by how many trips

710
0:43:37,260 --> 0:43:39,260
 they had completed in the past two weeks.

711
0:43:39,260 --> 0:43:41,260
 Meaning, taking days away

712
0:43:41,260 --> 0:43:43,260
 from driving could affect your income

713
0:43:43,260 --> 0:43:45,260
 for several weeks in the future.

714
0:43:45,260 --> 0:43:47,260
 Some drivers speculated that other

715
0:43:47,260 --> 0:43:49,260
 performance indicators such as customer ratings,

716
0:43:49,260 --> 0:43:51,260
 order cancellation, or even how much they turned

717
0:43:51,260 --> 0:43:53,260
 apps on or off might also affect these algorithms.

718
0:43:53,260 --> 0:43:55,260
 The result is that

719
0:43:55,260 --> 0:43:57,260
 drivers' experience of the value of their labor

720
0:43:57,260 --> 0:43:59,260
 fluctuates depending on what schema

721
0:43:59,260 --> 0:44:01,260
 they've been assigned.

722
0:44:01,260 --> 0:44:03,260
 Even if two drivers both complete

723
0:44:03,260 --> 0:44:05,260
 20 trips, driver A will only receive

724
0:44:05,260 --> 0:44:07,260
 the reward for 10 points.

725
0:44:07,260 --> 0:44:09,260
 They will not be compensated equally

726
0:44:09,260 --> 0:44:11,260
 for the same work.

727
0:44:11,260 --> 0:44:13,260
 These changes to the schema

728
0:44:13,260 --> 0:44:15,260
 were a really prominent part of my discussions

729
0:44:15,260 --> 0:44:17,260
 with drivers in 2019.

730
0:44:17,260 --> 0:44:19,260
 And notably, some drivers, despite their own

731
0:44:19,260 --> 0:44:21,260
 exasperations and frustrations with the system,

732
0:44:21,260 --> 0:44:23,260
 would differentiate schema A as being

733
0:44:23,260 --> 0:44:25,260
 for lazy drivers, and schema D

734
0:44:25,260 --> 0:44:27,260
 for drivers who were diligent.

735
0:44:27,260 --> 0:44:29,260
 Thus, they were also reproducing

736
0:44:29,260 --> 0:44:31,260
 these moral judgments that legitimized

737
0:44:31,260 --> 0:44:33,260
 the exploitation of the poor in service

738
0:44:33,260 --> 0:44:35,260
 of the middle class.

739
0:44:35,260 --> 0:44:37,260
 So to summarize,

740
0:44:37,260 --> 0:44:39,260
 the idea of P2P payments

741
0:44:39,260 --> 0:44:41,260
 leverages the social meaning and

742
0:44:41,260 --> 0:44:43,260
 positive connotations of social equality

743
0:44:43,260 --> 0:44:45,260
 associated with the word peer,

744
0:44:45,260 --> 0:44:47,260
 obscuring underlying power

745
0:44:47,260 --> 0:44:49,260
 asymmetries between the exchanging

746
0:44:49,260 --> 0:44:51,260
 parties, as well as the power

747
0:44:51,260 --> 0:44:53,260
 that these companies exert as they

748
0:44:53,260 --> 0:44:55,260
 define the conditions for exchange

749
0:44:55,260 --> 0:44:57,260
 within the digital infrastructure.

750
0:44:57,260 --> 0:44:59,260
 Furthermore,

751
0:44:59,260 --> 0:45:01,260
 this socially acceptable concept of

752
0:45:01,260 --> 0:45:03,260
 peer-to-peer ultimately conceals the

753
0:45:03,260 --> 0:45:05,260
 fact that this constellation

754
0:45:05,260 --> 0:45:07,260
 is a transactional arrangement

755
0:45:07,260 --> 0:45:09,260
 that is valuable to the corporation.

756
0:45:09,260 --> 0:45:11,260
 Users of the apps

757
0:45:11,260 --> 0:45:13,260
 no matter if they're drivers or customers

758
0:45:13,260 --> 0:45:15,260
 are tools for the platforms,

759
0:45:15,260 --> 0:45:17,260
 because their transactions lead to the circulation

760
0:45:17,260 --> 0:45:19,260
 of both money and data,

761
0:45:19,260 --> 0:45:21,260
 which is where profits are derived.

762
0:45:21,260 --> 0:45:23,260
 Thus, for the companies,

763
0:45:23,260 --> 0:45:25,260
 the emphasis is not on creating equal conditions

764
0:45:25,260 --> 0:45:27,260
 for exchange, but on securing

765
0:45:27,260 --> 0:45:29,260
 continued customer engagement.

766
0:45:29,260 --> 0:45:31,260
 And this is done by providing cheap and

767
0:45:31,260 --> 0:45:33,260
 convenient services through the platform,

768
0:45:33,260 --> 0:45:35,260
 which depends upon the exploitation of labor

769
0:45:35,260 --> 0:45:37,260
 and the displacement of transaction costs

770
0:45:37,260 --> 0:45:39,260
 of the digital payment onto drivers.

771
0:45:39,260 --> 0:45:41,260
 And this exploitation

772
0:45:41,260 --> 0:45:43,260
 and extraction of value

773
0:45:43,260 --> 0:45:45,260
 from transactional metadata

774
0:45:45,260 --> 0:45:47,260
 are what is camouflaged in the language of

775
0:45:47,260 --> 0:45:49,260
 peer-to-peer and financial inclusion.

776
0:45:49,260 --> 0:45:51,260
 Companies such as Gojek and Grab

777
0:45:51,260 --> 0:45:53,260
 continue to receive a lot of attention

778
0:45:53,260 --> 0:45:55,260
 for how they are revolutionizing

779
0:45:55,260 --> 0:45:57,260
 the economy through digital

780
0:45:57,260 --> 0:45:59,260
 technology, and how they are

781
0:45:59,260 --> 0:46:01,260
 automating existing systems and empowering

782
0:46:01,260 --> 0:46:03,260
 drivers by formalizing their service.

783
0:46:03,260 --> 0:46:05,260
 Meanwhile, they're growing into

784
0:46:05,260 --> 0:46:07,260
 super-apps, hoping to be the main gateway

785
0:46:07,260 --> 0:46:09,260
 for accessing and paying for services in Indonesia

786
0:46:09,260 --> 0:46:11,260
 and neighboring countries in Southeast Asia

787
0:46:11,260 --> 0:46:13,260
 They have attracted a massive amount

788
0:46:13,260 --> 0:46:15,260
 of international venture capital

789
0:46:15,260 --> 0:46:17,260
 from those wanting to be a part of

790
0:46:17,260 --> 0:46:19,260
 or beneficiary of this digital transition

791
0:46:19,260 --> 0:46:21,260
 as the companies extend

792
0:46:21,260 --> 0:46:23,260
 their monopolization of customers

793
0:46:23,260 --> 0:46:25,260
 and transactional metadata.

794
0:46:25,260 --> 0:46:27,260
 A few months ago,

795
0:46:27,260 --> 0:46:29,260
 Gojek announced a merger

796
0:46:29,260 --> 0:46:31,260
 with another Indonesian e-commerce company

797
0:46:31,260 --> 0:46:33,260
 called Tokopedia.

798
0:46:33,260 --> 0:46:35,260
 They formed the rather on-the-nose consortium

799
0:46:35,260 --> 0:46:37,260
 called Go2.

800
0:46:37,260 --> 0:46:39,260
 Their stated goal is to be publicly listed

801
0:46:39,260 --> 0:46:41,260
 on the stock exchanges in both Indonesia

802
0:46:41,260 --> 0:46:43,260
 and the U.S., with an estimated value

803
0:46:43,260 --> 0:46:45,260
 of up to 40 billion U.S. dollars.

804
0:46:45,260 --> 0:46:47,260
 Meanwhile, in Jogja,

805
0:46:47,260 --> 0:46:49,260
 drivers are chasing points

806
0:46:49,260 --> 0:46:51,260
 late into the night, stressing about

807
0:46:51,260 --> 0:46:53,260
 managing their digital balances

808
0:46:53,260 --> 0:46:55,260
 and worrying that customers might report them

809
0:46:55,260 --> 0:46:57,260
 for driving a borrowed account.

810
0:46:57,260 --> 0:46:59,260
 So Gojek and Grab may argue

811
0:46:59,260 --> 0:47:01,260
 that their digital technologies will

812
0:47:01,260 --> 0:47:03,260
 alleviate these problems and provide the poor

813
0:47:03,260 --> 0:47:05,260
 and disadvantaged with alternatives

814
0:47:05,260 --> 0:47:07,260
 to conventional financial services.

815
0:47:07,260 --> 0:47:09,260
 In practice, however, as the companies

816
0:47:09,260 --> 0:47:11,260
 chase profits and market monopolization

817
0:47:11,260 --> 0:47:13,260
 the structure of this money system

818
0:47:13,260 --> 0:47:15,260
 reinforces socio-economic hierarchies

819
0:47:15,260 --> 0:47:17,260
 and attempts to further enclose people

820
0:47:17,260 --> 0:47:19,260
 within the moat of digital payments.

821
0:47:19,260 --> 0:47:21,260
 Thank you.

822
0:47:31,260 --> 0:47:33,260
 Thank you to Sunima.

823
0:47:33,260 --> 0:47:35,260
 Any questions?

824
0:47:41,260 --> 0:47:47,260
 Hi.

825
0:47:47,260 --> 0:47:49,260
 It seems there's a lot of value

826
0:47:49,260 --> 0:47:51,260
 within these companies, and we've seen

827
0:47:51,260 --> 0:47:53,260
 a lot of other hacks around the world

828
0:47:53,260 --> 0:47:55,260
 of Bitcoin exchanges, which this is

829
0:47:55,260 --> 0:47:57,260
 a bit of similarity to, and it seems

830
0:47:57,260 --> 0:47:59,260
 to be easier to break into their systems

831
0:47:59,260 --> 0:48:01,260
 and perhaps inflate it or give all

832
0:48:01,260 --> 0:48:03,260
 the drivers a little bonus.

833
0:48:03,260 --> 0:48:05,260
 Has that happened, or...?

834
0:48:05,260 --> 0:48:07,260
 No.

835
0:48:07,260 --> 0:48:09,260
 Not yet.

836
0:48:11,260 --> 0:48:13,260
 OK.

837
0:48:13,260 --> 0:48:17,260
 So, is it possible to imagine a digital

838
0:48:17,260 --> 0:48:19,260
 payment system that does not have this

839
0:48:19,260 --> 0:48:21,260
 kind of exploitation, or are we doomed

840
0:48:21,260 --> 0:48:23,260
 to forever have exploitation be an intrinsic

841
0:48:23,260 --> 0:48:25,260
 part of digital payments, and should we

842
0:48:25,260 --> 0:48:27,260
 just all go back to cash and never

843
0:48:27,260 --> 0:48:29,260
 use technology again?

844
0:48:29,260 --> 0:48:31,260
 Are we doomed?

845
0:48:31,260 --> 0:48:33,260
 Maybe.

846
0:48:33,260 --> 0:48:35,260
 No.

847
0:48:35,260 --> 0:48:37,260
 I mean, I don't know.

848
0:48:37,260 --> 0:48:39,260
 I don't know.

849
0:48:39,260 --> 0:48:41,260
 I don't know.

850
0:48:41,260 --> 0:48:43,260
 I don't think that there's, like,

851
0:48:43,260 --> 0:48:45,260
 a deterministic outcome here.

852
0:48:45,260 --> 0:48:47,260
 Like, digital payments doesn't have to be negative.

853
0:48:47,260 --> 0:48:49,260
 I think what's really important is to focus

854
0:48:49,260 --> 0:48:51,260
 on what the people are saying as well, right?

855
0:48:51,260 --> 0:48:53,260
 That the emphasis here is not on something

856
0:48:53,260 --> 0:48:55,260
 being digital or being cash.

857
0:48:55,260 --> 0:48:57,260
 It's about the ability to flexibly transition

858
0:48:57,260 --> 0:48:59,260
 according to what suits your needs.

859
0:48:59,260 --> 0:49:01,260
 And so, from a designer point of view,

860
0:49:01,260 --> 0:49:03,260
 the purpose is to serve those needs, right?

861
0:49:03,260 --> 0:49:05,260
 To create that flexible system that enables

862
0:49:05,260 --> 0:49:07,260
 people to have the type of money form

863
0:49:07,260 --> 0:49:09,260
 that they actually need.

864
0:49:09,260 --> 0:49:11,260
 What's the issue with these kind of apps

865
0:49:11,260 --> 0:49:13,260
 that decidedly are not neutral in the way

866
0:49:13,260 --> 0:49:15,260
 that they, like, don't just model existing

867
0:49:15,260 --> 0:49:17,260
 transactions, but actually engineer

868
0:49:17,260 --> 0:49:19,260
 forms of transactions, right?

869
0:49:19,260 --> 0:49:21,260
 So of course you could design something different.

870
0:49:21,260 --> 0:49:23,260
 Whether or not you can change what has already

871
0:49:23,260 --> 0:49:25,260
 been made, I think is more complicated.

872
0:49:29,260 --> 0:49:31,260
 Thank you so much. It was wonderful

873
0:49:31,260 --> 0:49:33,260
 to hear such a brilliant talk.

874
0:49:33,260 --> 0:49:35,260
 I would like to ask if you're

875
0:49:35,260 --> 0:49:37,260
 seeing in the Danish context

876
0:49:37,260 --> 0:49:39,260
 something that resembles this

877
0:49:39,260 --> 0:49:41,260
 peer-to-peer philosophy.

878
0:49:41,260 --> 0:49:43,260
 Anyway.

879
0:49:45,260 --> 0:49:47,260
 That's a great question.

880
0:49:47,260 --> 0:49:49,260
 I mean, I think a lot

881
0:49:49,260 --> 0:49:51,260
 of the narratives around financial inclusion,

882
0:49:51,260 --> 0:49:53,260
 those kind of things, that's a type of hype

883
0:49:53,260 --> 0:49:55,260
 that also exists in Danish companies, for sure.

884
0:49:55,260 --> 0:49:57,260
 A lot of the advocacy about how these

885
0:49:57,260 --> 0:49:59,260
 kind of payment systems will make our lives

886
0:49:59,260 --> 0:50:01,260
 easier and more convenient also obscure

887
0:50:01,260 --> 0:50:03,260
 the fundamental fact that we're

888
0:50:03,260 --> 0:50:05,260
 opting into a private transactional

889
0:50:05,260 --> 0:50:07,260
 infrastructure, and the way

890
0:50:07,260 --> 0:50:09,260
 that those things are often being promoted

891
0:50:09,260 --> 0:50:11,260
 as being a better alternative to cash,

892
0:50:11,260 --> 0:50:13,260
 which I think is

893
0:50:13,260 --> 0:50:15,260
 almost malignant, to be honest.

894
0:50:15,260 --> 0:50:17,260
 I also think

895
0:50:17,260 --> 0:50:19,260
 something that hasn't quite happened here,

896
0:50:19,260 --> 0:50:21,260
 because in Indonesia you don't have credit cards.

897
0:50:21,260 --> 0:50:23,260
 You can't have a system like mobile pay.

898
0:50:23,260 --> 0:50:25,260
 But that doesn't mean that companies like

899
0:50:25,260 --> 0:50:27,260
 Vault or Uber and these kind of things

900
0:50:27,260 --> 0:50:29,260
 are not going to start introducing similar systems.

901
0:50:29,260 --> 0:50:31,260
 And it would be super interesting to know more about

902
0:50:31,260 --> 0:50:33,260
 how money actually exists within a system

903
0:50:33,260 --> 0:50:35,260
 like Vault. For example, if you get

904
0:50:35,260 --> 0:50:37,260
 you pay for something and they can't deliver,

905
0:50:37,260 --> 0:50:39,260
 so they kind of give you money to store

906
0:50:39,260 --> 0:50:41,260
 in that system. I would love to find out more

907
0:50:41,260 --> 0:50:43,260
 about how that actually works in practice.

908
0:50:53,260 --> 0:50:55,260
 Have the government interfered in any way?

909
0:50:55,260 --> 0:50:57,260
 Or any larger...

910
0:50:57,260 --> 0:50:59,260
 Yeah, the national

911
0:50:59,260 --> 0:51:01,260
 bank has a national

912
0:51:01,260 --> 0:51:03,260
 less-cash movement.

913
0:51:03,260 --> 0:51:05,260
 So the interference is definitely in favor

914
0:51:05,260 --> 0:51:07,260
 of these companies. Absolutely.

915
0:51:07,260 --> 0:51:09,260
 I mean, originally when Gojek

916
0:51:09,260 --> 0:51:11,260
 started, there was a massive

917
0:51:11,260 --> 0:51:13,260
 movement in the government.

918
0:51:13,260 --> 0:51:15,260
 The government actually tried to shut them down.

919
0:51:15,260 --> 0:51:17,260
 But there was such a mobilization,

920
0:51:17,260 --> 0:51:19,260
 like a million drivers protested.

921
0:51:19,260 --> 0:51:21,260
 And so they simply had to allow it to exist.

922
0:51:21,260 --> 0:51:23,260
 And the reality is that there are really close

923
0:51:23,260 --> 0:51:25,260
 ties politically between these CEOs

924
0:51:25,260 --> 0:51:27,260
 and the political class.

925
0:51:27,260 --> 0:51:29,260
 Like I said, the founder is a minister now.

926
0:51:29,260 --> 0:51:31,260
 And so are a lot of other...

927
0:51:31,260 --> 0:51:33,260
 The new president...

928
0:51:33,260 --> 0:51:35,260
 The president who was re-elected in 2019

929
0:51:35,260 --> 0:51:37,260
 brought in a bunch of young tech people,

930
0:51:37,260 --> 0:51:39,260
 like start-up people, to come and be a part

931
0:51:39,260 --> 0:51:41,260
 of it.

932
0:51:41,260 --> 0:51:43,260
 They're really gonna do it.

933
0:51:43,260 --> 0:51:45,260
 It's gonna be a digital country, for sure.

934
0:51:45,260 --> 0:51:47,260
 It's great.

935
0:51:47,260 --> 0:51:49,260
 Okay.

936
0:51:49,260 --> 0:51:51,260
 Thank you very much.

937
0:51:51,260 --> 0:51:53,260
 Thank you. Thank you so much for coming.
