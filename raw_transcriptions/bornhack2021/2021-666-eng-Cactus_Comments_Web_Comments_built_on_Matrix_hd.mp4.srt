0:00:00,000 --> 0:00:09,640
 Yes, so welcome to today's lightning talk.

2
0:00:09,960 --> 0:00:12,940
 We are going to start with a talk about cactus comment.

3
0:00:13,260 --> 0:00:15,840
 So you have five minutes. Go ahead.

4
0:00:30,000 --> 0:00:59,980
 Thank you.

5
0:01:00,000 --> 0:01:10,340
 Uh-huh. Does this work? Good.

6
0:01:10,840 --> 0:01:13,840
 Okay. So this is not cactus comments.

7
0:01:13,980 --> 0:01:15,340
 This is a traditional comment system.

8
0:01:15,760 --> 0:01:18,000
 You have a bunch of users that all use the same client

9
0:01:18,000 --> 0:01:20,260
 to access comments that are only hosted in one place.

10
0:01:21,060 --> 0:01:22,580
 This is what it looks like in Matrix.

11
0:01:23,000 --> 0:01:25,160
 You have users that can use different clients

12
0:01:25,160 --> 0:01:27,300
 to interact with different servers

13
0:01:27,300 --> 0:01:29,000
 and still have the same conversation.

14
0:01:30,000 --> 0:01:33,200
 So you have sort of the email reminiscent structure

15
0:01:33,200 --> 0:01:36,240
 of having IDs on different servers,

16
0:01:36,680 --> 0:01:39,100
 but they can still be in a room that's shared between servers.

17
0:01:41,400 --> 0:01:45,920
 So cactus comments is just a Matrix client.

18
0:01:46,560 --> 0:01:49,080
 It runs in the browser. It's written in Elm.

19
0:01:50,360 --> 0:01:52,260
 And you have a login button.

20
0:01:52,700 --> 0:01:56,220
 And in that login button, you can put in the login field,

21
0:01:56,220 --> 0:01:58,960
 you can put in the URL of your own home server,

22
0:02:00,000 --> 0:02:02,520
 and then you just connect to your own server.

23
0:02:02,980 --> 0:02:04,300
 So the browser, from that point on,

24
0:02:04,540 --> 0:02:07,720
 doesn't need to talk to anything that's hosted by the website owner.

25
0:02:08,060 --> 0:02:09,960
 You just log in through your own Matrix server.

26
0:02:12,620 --> 0:02:16,440
 There's also another component that runs on the server side,

27
0:02:16,660 --> 0:02:18,720
 which is Matrix application service.

28
0:02:19,460 --> 0:02:21,760
 This part isn't strictly necessary

29
0:02:21,760 --> 0:02:23,760
 to actually use cactus comments,

30
0:02:23,760 --> 0:02:27,000
 but it adds some nice quality-of-life features.

31
0:02:28,440 --> 0:02:29,760
 So this means that you don't...

32
0:02:30,000 --> 0:02:32,000
 you don't have to manually go and create rooms.

33
0:02:32,000 --> 0:02:34,000
 The application service can do that for you.

34
0:02:34,000 --> 0:02:36,000
 And it also does some nice moderation stuff.

35
0:02:36,000 --> 0:02:38,000
 If you make somebody an admin in one room,

36
0:02:38,000 --> 0:02:40,000
 they will have admin privileges in the other rooms.

37
0:02:44,000 --> 0:02:46,000
 Yeah, and it's all a chatbot interface,

38
0:02:46,000 --> 0:02:52,000
 so you talk to and configure the application service through Matrix.

39
0:02:54,000 --> 0:02:56,000
 So why did we build this?

40
0:02:56,000 --> 0:02:58,000
 Why would we want to have comments on Matrix?

41
0:02:58,000 --> 0:03:00,000
 Why would we want to have comments on Matrix?

42
0:03:00,000 --> 0:03:02,000
 Does it give us any advantages,

43
0:03:02,000 --> 0:03:04,000
 or is it just more complexity?

44
0:03:04,000 --> 0:03:06,000
 This could probably be five slides,

45
0:03:06,000 --> 0:03:08,000
 but it's one slide.

46
0:03:12,000 --> 0:03:14,000
 One reason is identity defragmentation.

47
0:03:14,000 --> 0:03:18,000
 Right now, in order to comment on blogA.com,

48
0:03:18,000 --> 0:03:20,000
 you have one identity there,

49
0:03:20,000 --> 0:03:22,000
 and then in order to comment on blogB.com,

50
0:03:22,000 --> 0:03:24,000
 you have a different identity there.

51
0:03:24,000 --> 0:03:26,000
 In Matrix, we can sort of unify that,

52
0:03:26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
 and have the same identity across different platforms.

53
0:03:28,000 --> 0:03:30,000
 and have the same identity across different platforms.

54
0:03:30,000 --> 0:03:32,000
 We have more comedian follow ups.

55
0:03:32,000 --> 0:03:34,000
 We have more comedian follow ups.

56
0:03:34,000 --> 0:03:36,000
 I can install the Element app on my phone,

57
0:03:36,000 --> 0:03:38,000
 and I'll get notifications

58
0:03:38,000 --> 0:03:40,000
 when somebody puts a comment on my blog post.

59
0:03:40,000 --> 0:03:42,000
 That's really nice.

60
0:03:42,000 --> 0:03:44,000
 There's a resilience point.

61
0:03:44,000 --> 0:03:46,000
 There's a resilience point.

62
0:03:46,000 --> 0:03:48,000
 If the conversation can outlast

63
0:03:48,000 --> 0:03:50,000
 the infrastructure of the website

64
0:03:50,000 --> 0:03:52,000
 that the comment section is on.

65
0:03:52,000 --> 0:03:54,000
 that the infrastructure of the website

66
0:03:54,000 --> 0:03:56,000
 that the comment section is on.

67
0:03:56,000 --> 0:04:00,920
 the website that uses cactus comments and maybe by default people can log in

68
0:04:00,920 --> 0:04:04,620
 you on my matrix server and then two wonderful nerds meet and have a

69
0:04:04,620 --> 0:04:08,820
 conversation there and then I kill my blog someday as long as those two

70
0:04:08,820 --> 0:04:12,020
 different nerds are on two different matrix home servers the comment section

71
0:04:12,020 --> 0:04:16,940
 still exists so the conversation can outlive the website infrastructure which is

72
0:04:16,940 --> 0:04:21,860
 really cool it's resistant to third-party censorship because you can

73
0:04:21,860 --> 0:04:25,760
 run your own matrix server so you don't have to do the Facebook comments or

74
0:04:25,760 --> 0:04:29,460
 Disqus thing of relying on a big company that could go and remove your

75
0:04:29,460 --> 0:04:34,900
 stuff and then you have more interaction options maybe some people would like to

76
0:04:34,900 --> 0:04:40,580
 keep a conversation going in the comments or get notifications but don't

77
0:04:40,580 --> 0:04:44,560
 want to log into the web browser and get the thing you can choose which clients

78
0:04:44,560 --> 0:04:48,640
 you're participating in the conversation from so there's many different clients

79
0:04:48,640 --> 0:04:52,080
 and you choose the one that works for you if you're a terminal geek you boot up

80
0:04:52,080 --> 0:04:54,720
 WeChat if you like simple clients you boot up

81
0:04:54,720 --> 0:04:55,760
 PluffyChat if you like simple clients you boot up PluffyChat if you like

82
0:04:55,760 --> 0:04:59,760
 Or you can use element.

83
0:04:59,760 --> 0:05:01,760
 Cool. That's Cactus comments.

84
0:05:01,760 --> 0:05:03,760
 What now? How do you participate?

85
0:05:03,760 --> 0:05:05,760
 We have a room on matrix.

86
0:05:05,760 --> 0:05:08,760
 It's cactus colon cactus dot chat.

87
0:05:08,760 --> 0:05:12,760
 We are on GitLab.

88
0:05:12,760 --> 0:05:14,760
 It's all open source.

89
0:05:14,760 --> 0:05:16,760
 It's GPL licensed.

90
0:05:16,760 --> 0:05:18,760
 Going to be moving to LGPL soon.

91
0:05:18,760 --> 0:05:20,760
 That's a different thing.

92
0:05:20,760 --> 0:05:23,760
 But go and contribute or have a look at the code if you want.

93
0:05:23,760 --> 0:05:27,760
 We have a website which has documentation and how to use it.

94
0:05:27,760 --> 0:05:29,760
 Should be pretty straightforward.

95
0:05:29,760 --> 0:05:32,760
 And then, of course, come catch me if you want to talk about it.

96
0:05:32,760 --> 0:05:34,760
 I'll be in the bar or I'll be down in Noisy.

97
0:05:34,760 --> 0:05:37,760
 And we have stickers.

98
0:05:37,760 --> 0:05:40,760
 All right. That's it.
