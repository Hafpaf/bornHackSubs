0:00:00,000 --> 0:00:02,000
 You

2
0:00:30,000 --> 0:00:37,840
 So, I would like to welcome you to this little earlier event for Bornhack Standards at 11 p.m. on a Sunday,

3
0:00:38,140 --> 0:00:41,780
 where there are a lot of people who may have been children, but we are all very quick.

4
0:00:42,160 --> 0:00:45,300
 We also expect that there will be some more runners here at some point.

5
0:00:45,960 --> 0:00:50,540
 I would like to welcome Stinus Lindgren, who is a member of the Radical Left.

6
0:00:50,940 --> 0:00:55,240
 He is not a political politician, he is a candidate in bioinformatics from KÃ¸benhavn University,

7
0:00:55,240 --> 0:00:56,740
 and he is a bachelor in datalogy.

8
0:00:56,740 --> 0:01:01,300
 He has previously worked as a researcher for Stenu Diabetes Center and Carlsbad Laboratories,

9
0:01:01,420 --> 0:01:06,760
 and today he is a chairperson for ethics, research chairperson, IT chairperson,

10
0:01:07,460 --> 0:01:11,720
 chairperson for the Nordic Cooperation, psychiatry chairperson, health chairperson, technology chairperson,

11
0:01:11,820 --> 0:01:17,500
 all chairpersons, but certainly not our audience here is most interested in his relationship to IT and technology.

12
0:01:18,180 --> 0:01:19,800
 Welcome to Stinus Lindgren.

13
0:01:20,880 --> 0:01:21,660
 Thank you very much for that.

14
0:01:25,660 --> 0:01:26,720
 I don't know if you can hear that.

15
0:01:26,860 --> 0:01:30,640
 There are some who are clapping, that's always something, because we can't hear photopolitics,

16
0:01:30,700 --> 0:01:34,340
 so you can't see the audience, you have to look at me in this context.

17
0:01:34,720 --> 0:01:39,380
 And we have to say, the reason you are not here is that your wife is waiting, and there has not been a child yet,

18
0:01:39,600 --> 0:01:42,120
 and therefore you have to sit at home with this computer.

19
0:01:42,760 --> 0:01:47,340
 What I would like to hear about first is a little about what is your relationship to IT?

20
0:01:47,580 --> 0:01:50,600
 How do you have it with computers and the internet?

21
0:01:54,860 --> 0:01:56,420
 I have unfortunately not been with IT before.

22
0:01:56,740 --> 0:02:01,560
 I took it just before the summer holiday, which has been, as we know, and we will not go into details about it,

23
0:02:01,620 --> 0:02:04,780
 it is some kind of exchange in our public service group here in the last year's time.

24
0:02:05,520 --> 0:02:09,780
 So I ended up getting it, and it fits quite well in relation to my background, as you yourself were talking about here.

25
0:02:10,580 --> 0:02:13,600
 And we have primarily discussed things like broadband packs and some things like that right now.

26
0:02:15,180 --> 0:02:21,940
 But what I think is exciting about IT is that it fills an incredible amount of good and evil in our society.

27
0:02:21,940 --> 0:02:25,360
 And that's why I'm sitting here talking to you via my iPad, if I'm not mistaken,

28
0:02:26,740 --> 0:02:28,740
 and you take that out of law in the Public Parliament,

29
0:02:28,740 --> 0:02:33,260
 it's something you can use for one's personal life.

30
0:02:33,260 --> 0:02:35,260
 That is what it's all about.

31
0:02:35,260 --> 0:02:39,160
 And whether we should use IT to everything we choose to do on the public side.

32
0:02:39,160 --> 0:02:44,120
 It's indeed vital that it comes into the into the discussion process.

33
0:02:46,540 --> 0:02:50,580
 There are many things about IT we shouldn't say to the audience sitting here,

34
0:02:50,580 --> 0:02:52,320
 but there are also some things you should be aware of.

35
0:02:52,320 --> 0:02:54,320
 Whether this is the right way to use it.

36
0:02:54,440 --> 0:02:56,100
 And while you're thinking of this,

37
0:02:56,100 --> 0:02:56,140
 I'd like to ask you for a quick question.

38
0:02:56,140 --> 0:02:56,440
 A quick question?

39
0:02:56,440 --> 0:02:56,620
 Yes.

40
0:02:56,620 --> 0:02:58,360
 As I said, you have a background in this.

41
0:02:58,840 --> 0:03:02,660
 It's not because you're going to sit and tease the other parliamentarians in here,

42
0:03:02,700 --> 0:03:08,260
 but how do you experience the climate around this with computers and IT in the city when you walk around day to day?

43
0:03:10,360 --> 0:03:12,220
 It's not something that fills me up that much.

44
0:03:12,580 --> 0:03:16,500
 You also mentioned some of my other leadership, and it's no secret that in the last year and a half,

45
0:03:16,500 --> 0:03:20,300
 it has primarily been my health leadership that has filled my time.

46
0:03:21,100 --> 0:03:22,040
 Maybe not so surprisingly.

47
0:03:22,680 --> 0:03:24,060
 There has also been some IT there.

48
0:03:24,240 --> 0:03:25,540
 We'll get to that a little later.

49
0:03:25,540 --> 0:03:28,400
 But it's not my impression that it's something that...

50
0:03:28,400 --> 0:03:33,080
 I think it can be done on one hand, and many can sit down and code in Perl, for example,

51
0:03:33,280 --> 0:03:34,240
 if you ask the people there.

52
0:03:35,440 --> 0:03:37,800
 And I would be on that one hand, I can tell you.

53
0:03:39,000 --> 0:03:40,520
 You feel lonely once in a while.

54
0:03:42,000 --> 0:03:43,760
 Yes, it's a lonely place.

55
0:03:44,500 --> 0:03:49,700
 But Denmark, as such, we are one of the world's most digitized countries in these meetings.

56
0:03:49,800 --> 0:03:51,140
 At least that's what it's called all the time.

57
0:03:51,260 --> 0:03:54,700
 How do you experience Denmark as an incredibly well-digitalized country?

58
0:03:55,540 --> 0:04:00,140
 Yes, I do, depending on where you are in the word, I think.

59
0:04:00,400 --> 0:04:01,540
 But yes, I do, in any case.

60
0:04:01,660 --> 0:04:09,100
 When we look at, for example, during Corona, we have discussed a lot about vaccines, tests, strategy, all this.

61
0:04:09,260 --> 0:04:10,720
 How do we register all the right places?

62
0:04:11,540 --> 0:04:18,560
 And it has been quite easy in Denmark, whereas a country like Germany, for example, has been incredibly complicated to do,

63
0:04:18,560 --> 0:04:24,940
 because they don't have the same, what can you say, natural access to home.

64
0:04:25,540 --> 0:04:31,200
 And that has been, we are, that's one thing we can see, just in the time I have been in the parliament,

65
0:04:31,280 --> 0:04:35,600
 we have had a digital health card, which there are so many good things to say about.

66
0:04:36,100 --> 0:04:39,980
 It's us who have children, we don't know how it is to stand as a doctor, and then there's actually another who has a health card and all this.

67
0:04:40,300 --> 0:04:41,120
 So there are some good things about it.

68
0:04:41,920 --> 0:04:44,380
 It's not long since we got our NemID app and all this.

69
0:04:44,500 --> 0:04:50,020
 We're starting to get more and more things moved over to IT, and it's been taken down.

70
0:04:50,020 --> 0:04:54,460
 We can see how quickly it is taken well into the public.

71
0:04:55,540 --> 0:05:01,180
 In that way, we are an extremely digitized society, we are, as I said, in a good way, but it is.

72
0:05:03,460 --> 0:05:11,160
 I would just like to say here that we are a bunch of people sitting here listening to you in this tent, and apart from that, there are also some people on a chat behind us who can sit and follow along,

73
0:05:11,160 --> 0:05:16,140
 and some who are sitting and looking directly at our live stream on the internet, and I have a little question for the audience.

74
0:05:16,140 --> 0:05:25,300
 If you have anything you would like to ask, you can just start waving your arms insanely, and then you can go up to a microphone here in the middle and ask a question directly to Stenus Lindgren.

75
0:05:25,540 --> 0:05:32,700
 So if no one comes, I'll just have to stand here and talk to him along the way, and it would be exciting if some of you also come with something at some point.

76
0:05:32,960 --> 0:05:42,940
 But the first thing, now you were just on the internet, this coronavirus and the pandemic has put its mark on the country, and especially two things have been discussed in a violent way, at least politically.

77
0:05:42,940 --> 0:05:46,780
 One is the infection stop app, and the other is the corona pass.

78
0:05:47,300 --> 0:05:51,900
 I just want to start by asking you, have you still installed your infection stop app on your phone?

79
0:05:53,460 --> 0:05:55,300
 I actually still have.

80
0:05:55,540 --> 0:06:01,420
 Probably mostly because I haven't removed it, but I still have it, and I also have a corona pass app.

81
0:06:02,960 --> 0:06:06,540
 Yes, that was the answer to your question. I don't know if I should say more, but I'm curious if you have any more questions.

82
0:06:06,540 --> 0:06:13,200
 There are some follow-up questions coming in at this point. I just wanted to hear first, have you ever received a notification on this infection stop app?

83
0:06:13,200 --> 0:06:20,880
 I actually have that too. It's been a long time, but I have it, and it's been in the after years.

84
0:06:20,880 --> 0:06:25,440
 So if it's proof that it works, it might be a bit abstract.

85
0:06:25,440 --> 0:06:28,000
 But I have actually received a notification. I'm one of the lucky ones.

86
0:06:29,280 --> 0:06:34,140
 This infection stop app, there has been a terrible lot done about the introduction of it.

87
0:06:34,140 --> 0:06:38,240
 How do you think the process has been about getting this infection stop app done in its time?

88
0:06:39,000 --> 0:06:41,820
 But actually, it was a pretty good process.

89
0:06:41,820 --> 0:06:52,320
 There were a number of critics, myself included, of the original ideas, because there were some completely obvious problems in the way that they had considered it.

90
0:06:52,320 --> 0:06:53,340
 In relation to collecting data.

91
0:06:53,340 --> 0:06:53,860
 In relation to collecting data.

92
0:06:53,860 --> 0:06:54,360
 In relation to collecting data.

93
0:06:54,360 --> 0:06:54,880
 In relation to collecting data.

94
0:06:54,880 --> 0:06:55,400
 In relation to collecting data.

95
0:06:55,440 --> 0:07:10,540
 This was

96
0:07:10,540 --> 0:07:16,740
 important.

97
0:07:16,740 --> 0:07:17,480
 It was important to make data minimization.

98
0:07:17,480 --> 0:07:23,080
 Only collect, only collect data that is necessary for the goal you have with this app.

99
0:07:23,080 --> 0:07:24,880
 It should not be personal transfer, because it is not relevant.

100
0:07:24,880 --> 0:07:31,880
 The person received a message that the person's mobile phone had been connected to another that had been tested positive.

101
0:07:31,880 --> 0:07:35,880
 The problem is that you don't need to collect all kinds of other information.

102
0:07:35,880 --> 0:07:40,880
 You don't need to collect GPS data, you don't need to collect information about who the person is.

103
0:07:40,880 --> 0:07:43,880
 It is only important to know if a device has been connected to another device.

104
0:07:43,880 --> 0:07:46,880
 And we spent a lot of time discussing this.

105
0:07:46,880 --> 0:07:51,880
 And it was also backed up by Data Ethics Council, which you know very well,

106
0:07:51,880 --> 0:07:59,880
 that Data Ethics Council was a solution that kept a number of all the requirements that were raised to ensure that the person received the data.

107
0:07:59,880 --> 0:08:05,880
 So in this way, it was actually a positive example of being able to start somewhere that was completely wrong,

108
0:08:05,880 --> 0:08:08,880
 and end somewhere that was actually really, really good.

109
0:08:08,880 --> 0:08:11,880
 If you then of course accept that it should be done.

110
0:08:11,880 --> 0:08:13,880
 But I actually think it was a very nice process.

111
0:08:13,880 --> 0:08:16,880
 There is a question from the audience here.

112
0:08:16,880 --> 0:08:20,880
 Yes, I'll try to see if I can explain it in a sensible way.

113
0:08:21,880 --> 0:08:26,880
 Hello? Can you hear me?

114
0:08:26,880 --> 0:08:27,880
 Yes, I can.

115
0:08:27,880 --> 0:08:31,880
 Great. I'll try to see if I can explain it in a sensible way.

116
0:08:31,880 --> 0:08:37,880
 Because I definitely don't think that the latest projects and apps that have been introduced are good.

117
0:08:37,880 --> 0:08:42,880
 And I'm probably looking for some tips from you, because you are in the position that you are in right now.

118
0:08:42,880 --> 0:08:46,880
 Where you can tell us how we can convince the politicians.

119
0:08:46,880 --> 0:08:51,880
 You can say that first of all, we and you know that computers are not precise.

120
0:08:51,880 --> 0:08:55,880
 And especially not when we are based on a lot of models and ideas.

121
0:08:55,880 --> 0:09:00,880
 And when we then have projects like an app that you suddenly want,

122
0:09:00,880 --> 0:09:06,880
 then you have a tendency in Denmark to look at some kind of sunscreen scenario.

123
0:09:06,880 --> 0:09:09,880
 And then it is good enough that you have looked at the sunscreen scenario,

124
0:09:09,880 --> 0:09:12,880
 and then you get out of it and then you buy an app.

125
0:09:12,880 --> 0:09:17,880
 And it shows in many of the situations and use situations we have,

126
0:09:17,880 --> 0:09:19,880
 that there is either misuse,

127
0:09:19,880 --> 0:09:22,880
 or it turns out that you cannot implement the rest,

128
0:09:22,880 --> 0:09:25,880
 or you lose a large part of the population.

129
0:09:25,880 --> 0:09:29,880
 So how do we convince the politicians that computers are not precise,

130
0:09:29,880 --> 0:09:32,880
 and we should think things through a little more,

131
0:09:32,880 --> 0:09:35,880
 among other things with privacy, before we start?

132
0:09:35,880 --> 0:09:42,880
 Good question. And it goes from a general view of apps from the public.

133
0:09:42,880 --> 0:09:44,880
 Because now I said before that it was...

134
0:09:44,880 --> 0:09:45,880
 Yes, also solutions from the public.

135
0:09:45,880 --> 0:09:47,880
 So also solutions out at municipal offices,

136
0:09:47,880 --> 0:09:50,880
 and people who get the message that they have to pay 15,000 back,

137
0:09:50,880 --> 0:09:53,880
 even though they have not been paid the money, or whatever it could be.

138
0:09:53,880 --> 0:09:58,880
 Yes, that's a pretty big question.

139
0:09:58,880 --> 0:10:02,880
 One thing I forgot to say about the corona pass,

140
0:10:02,880 --> 0:10:04,880
 sorry, the vaccine.

141
0:10:04,880 --> 0:10:08,880
 When I said it was a good process, it was in relation to the outcome of it.

142
0:10:08,880 --> 0:10:11,880
 But there was a lot to be criticized in relation to how much it cost,

143
0:10:11,880 --> 0:10:13,880
 how the export actually worked,

144
0:10:13,880 --> 0:10:16,880
 how we could define whether the task was complete,

145
0:10:16,880 --> 0:10:19,880
 whether the task could be solved,

146
0:10:19,880 --> 0:10:21,880
 which is something you are talking about here.

147
0:10:21,880 --> 0:10:23,880
 Because it was never, in my opinion at least,

148
0:10:23,880 --> 0:10:25,880
 and that's how some others sold it,

149
0:10:25,880 --> 0:10:28,880
 but in my opinion it was never meant to solve the epidemic.

150
0:10:28,880 --> 0:10:30,880
 It couldn't do that.

151
0:10:30,880 --> 0:10:33,880
 It should only be seen as a supplement to catch some of the infection chains

152
0:10:33,880 --> 0:10:35,880
 that you couldn't catch otherwise.

153
0:10:35,880 --> 0:10:38,880
 And this was a time when we didn't test it as intensively as we do today.

154
0:10:38,880 --> 0:10:44,880
 But how do you convince people about privacy by design?

155
0:10:44,880 --> 0:10:46,880
 I haven't been sitting there for that long.

156
0:10:46,880 --> 0:10:48,880
 I've been living here for two years,

157
0:10:48,880 --> 0:10:50,880
 and I've only been here for 42 years since the summer holidays.

158
0:10:50,880 --> 0:10:52,880
 But I've realized that the times we've discussed it,

159
0:10:52,880 --> 0:10:54,880
 and it's been with the infection stop,

160
0:10:54,880 --> 0:10:56,880
 and it's been with the corona pass,

161
0:10:56,880 --> 0:10:58,880
 I've realized that there should be built-in privacy by design,

162
0:10:58,880 --> 0:11:00,880
 there should be data minimization,

163
0:11:00,880 --> 0:11:03,880
 and it should be, I think, open source,

164
0:11:03,880 --> 0:11:05,880
 because it's publicly paid data,

165
0:11:05,880 --> 0:11:08,880
 and it's safer, in my opinion, to do it that way.

166
0:11:08,880 --> 0:11:10,880
 But until I've done that,

167
0:11:10,880 --> 0:11:13,880
 it doesn't make any impression that there have been any special people in the trade union board

168
0:11:13,880 --> 0:11:14,880
 who have mentioned these things,

169
0:11:14,880 --> 0:11:16,880
 because there hasn't been any attention to it.

170
0:11:16,880 --> 0:11:18,880
 So my advice to you,

171
0:11:18,880 --> 0:11:20,880
 I don't know how many of you are sitting there,

172
0:11:20,880 --> 0:11:22,880
 but those of you who are interested in working with this,

173
0:11:22,880 --> 0:11:25,880
 is to get in touch with the respective IT leaders,

174
0:11:25,880 --> 0:11:27,880
 and talk to them.

175
0:11:27,880 --> 0:11:29,880
 Ask them if they have time to take a meeting,

176
0:11:29,880 --> 0:11:31,880
 so you can present some of these things to them,

177
0:11:31,880 --> 0:11:33,880
 and explain why it's important,

178
0:11:33,880 --> 0:11:34,880
 why they make sense,

179
0:11:34,880 --> 0:11:36,880
 and why you shouldn't be afraid of it as a politician.

180
0:11:36,880 --> 0:11:38,880
 That's the way to do it.

181
0:11:38,880 --> 0:11:41,880
 And then, of course, it's important to try to be aware

182
0:11:41,880 --> 0:11:43,880
 if there are any projects underway.

183
0:11:43,880 --> 0:11:44,880
 Because as soon as it's included in the case,

184
0:11:44,880 --> 0:11:46,880
 it's relatively difficult to change it.

185
0:11:46,880 --> 0:11:48,880
 So it's important to see if there is something

186
0:11:48,880 --> 0:11:51,880
 in the law catalogue or elsewhere,

187
0:11:51,880 --> 0:11:54,880
 where there is a new app or a new service,

188
0:11:54,880 --> 0:11:56,880
 whatever it may be.

189
0:11:56,880 --> 0:11:58,880
 I'm sorry, I don't want to get banned on this stream,

190
0:11:58,880 --> 0:12:00,880
 but it has now been done.

191
0:12:00,880 --> 0:12:04,880
 So make sure to contact the respective leaders

192
0:12:04,880 --> 0:12:07,880
 before the negotiations start.

193
0:12:07,880 --> 0:12:09,880
 And that's probably something completely new for many of you

194
0:12:09,880 --> 0:12:10,880
 who are sitting in this,

195
0:12:10,880 --> 0:12:12,880
 some of you are probably used to it,

196
0:12:12,880 --> 0:12:13,880
 but it's probably new for most of you,

197
0:12:13,880 --> 0:12:15,880
 how it works.

198
0:12:15,880 --> 0:12:16,880
 It was new for me.

199
0:12:16,880 --> 0:12:18,880
 I can see when I come from the research world

200
0:12:18,880 --> 0:12:20,880
 that it's not a place where you ever consider

201
0:12:20,880 --> 0:12:21,880
 how things work in the city.

202
0:12:21,880 --> 0:12:24,880
 And I've been contacted very often by researchers

203
0:12:24,880 --> 0:12:26,880
 after we've taken something in and said,

204
0:12:26,880 --> 0:12:28,880
 hey, you should have done it this way,

205
0:12:28,880 --> 0:12:29,880
 but it's too late.

206
0:12:29,880 --> 0:12:31,880
 You should contact people before we go down

207
0:12:31,880 --> 0:12:32,880
 to negotiations about it.

208
0:12:32,880 --> 0:12:34,880
 Otherwise, we can't change it.

209
0:12:34,880 --> 0:12:35,880
 So it's important to be proactive,

210
0:12:35,880 --> 0:12:37,880
 it's important to be aware of what's coming,

211
0:12:37,880 --> 0:12:40,880
 so you can get people before it's taken in.

212
0:12:40,880 --> 0:12:42,880
 Because that's the only way we can change these things.

213
0:12:42,880 --> 0:12:44,880
 At least that's the easiest way.

214
0:12:45,880 --> 0:12:47,880
 I think that's a very good answer.

215
0:12:47,880 --> 0:12:48,880
 We'll have to try to figure out

216
0:12:48,880 --> 0:12:49,880
 how we can do more with it.

217
0:12:49,880 --> 0:12:51,880
 I'm also speculating on something

218
0:12:51,880 --> 0:12:53,880
 that's a bit out of this earlier question.

219
0:12:53,880 --> 0:12:54,880
 I'm thinking,

220
0:12:54,880 --> 0:12:57,880
 in a way, it's like all public solutions

221
0:12:57,880 --> 0:13:00,880
 are really working in a kind of a duopoly

222
0:13:00,880 --> 0:13:02,880
 of either Apple in the US

223
0:13:02,880 --> 0:13:05,880
 or Android in these contexts.

224
0:13:05,880 --> 0:13:07,880
 Do you think there's some kind of chance

225
0:13:07,880 --> 0:13:09,880
 for people to be able to convince people

226
0:13:09,880 --> 0:13:11,880
 in the parliament, as you mentioned,

227
0:13:11,880 --> 0:13:13,880
 to start making some more open source-like solutions,

228
0:13:13,880 --> 0:13:15,880
 where there's a possibility

229
0:13:15,880 --> 0:13:18,880
 that you can participate in the ordinary life

230
0:13:18,880 --> 0:13:19,880
 in a different way

231
0:13:19,880 --> 0:13:21,880
 than having an iPhone or an Android?

232
0:13:25,880 --> 0:13:27,880
 We just want to answer yes.

233
0:13:27,880 --> 0:13:29,880
 I can't do that right now.

234
0:13:29,880 --> 0:13:30,880
 What I can say is,

235
0:13:30,880 --> 0:13:32,880
 about open source, for example,

236
0:13:32,880 --> 0:13:34,880
 I've been involved in that.

237
0:13:34,880 --> 0:13:36,880
 I can't take the honor of doing it alone,

238
0:13:36,880 --> 0:13:38,880
 but some of the things we've developed during the pandemic

239
0:13:38,880 --> 0:13:40,880
 have become open source afterwards.

240
0:13:40,880 --> 0:13:42,880
 We made an offer where we said the requirement was

241
0:13:42,880 --> 0:13:44,880
 that the code became open source.

242
0:13:44,880 --> 0:13:45,880
 So it can be done.

243
0:13:45,880 --> 0:13:47,880
 It just requires that someone says it

244
0:13:47,880 --> 0:13:49,880
 and that enough is shown

245
0:13:49,880 --> 0:13:51,880
 that it's a good idea to do.

246
0:13:51,880 --> 0:13:53,880
 You just have to remember

247
0:13:53,880 --> 0:13:55,880
 that if you go in and talk to the 179 members

248
0:13:55,880 --> 0:13:56,880
 of the parliament,

249
0:13:56,880 --> 0:13:58,880
 it's probably a handful of people

250
0:13:58,880 --> 0:13:59,880
 who understand what open source is.

251
0:13:59,880 --> 0:14:00,880
 And it's not to take them down.

252
0:14:00,880 --> 0:14:02,880
 It's just clear that if you've never worked with it,

253
0:14:02,880 --> 0:14:04,880
 it's just a word you don't know what it's in.

254
0:14:04,880 --> 0:14:06,880
 So it's important to be able to explain this,

255
0:14:06,880 --> 0:14:08,880
 what it means and why it's important.

256
0:14:08,880 --> 0:14:09,880
 There are a lot of impediments.

257
0:14:09,880 --> 0:14:10,880
 We just have to remember that.

258
0:14:10,880 --> 0:14:11,880
 There are a lot of people

259
0:14:11,880 --> 0:14:12,880
 who know very well

260
0:14:12,880 --> 0:14:13,880
 what these things are all about.

261
0:14:13,880 --> 0:14:15,880
 But you have to make sure

262
0:14:15,880 --> 0:14:17,880
 that the relevant politicians

263
0:14:17,880 --> 0:14:19,880
 also know what these concepts

264
0:14:19,880 --> 0:14:21,880
 actually cover.

265
0:14:21,880 --> 0:14:23,880
 So that's the first step.

266
0:14:23,880 --> 0:14:26,880
 The reason why when you ask

267
0:14:26,880 --> 0:14:28,880
 if a single app can be developed

268
0:14:28,880 --> 0:14:29,880
 as open source

269
0:14:29,880 --> 0:14:30,880
 or whether we should make

270
0:14:30,880 --> 0:14:31,880
 some larger things open source,

271
0:14:31,880 --> 0:14:35,880
 I think we can do some things,

272
0:14:35,880 --> 0:14:36,880
 but the problem is that

273
0:14:36,880 --> 0:14:38,880
 some of it is built so much together

274
0:14:38,880 --> 0:14:40,880
 with existing infrastructure

275
0:14:40,880 --> 0:14:41,880
 that it's not possible

276
0:14:41,880 --> 0:14:43,880
 to make it a larger project

277
0:14:43,880 --> 0:14:44,880
 to get it pushed over

278
0:14:44,880 --> 0:14:46,880
 to another platform.

279
0:14:46,880 --> 0:14:47,880
 That's my impression,

280
0:14:47,880 --> 0:14:48,880
 without knowing all the details

281
0:14:48,880 --> 0:14:49,880
 in the public IT,

282
0:14:49,880 --> 0:14:50,880
 and it might be very nice

283
0:14:50,880 --> 0:14:51,880
 if I don't do it.

284
0:14:51,880 --> 0:14:53,880
 I think it's a very terrible system

285
0:14:53,880 --> 0:14:54,880
 that's first started digging into it.

286
0:14:54,880 --> 0:14:57,880
 But I think we can take it step by step

287
0:14:57,880 --> 0:14:58,880
 and make it better.

288
0:14:58,880 --> 0:15:00,880
 And we can see, as I said,

289
0:15:00,880 --> 0:15:01,880
 that it can be done.

290
0:15:01,880 --> 0:15:03,880
 In the time we've been discussing

291
0:15:03,880 --> 0:15:05,880
 various corona IT projects,

292
0:15:05,880 --> 0:15:06,880
 it has been possible

293
0:15:06,880 --> 0:15:08,880
 to get something out of this.

294
0:15:08,880 --> 0:15:10,880
 So it's quite a bit of pressure.

295
0:15:10,880 --> 0:15:11,880
 But I think we can see

296
0:15:11,880 --> 0:15:12,880
 that there are people

297
0:15:12,880 --> 0:15:13,880
 who are aware of it,

298
0:15:13,880 --> 0:15:14,880
 and there are people

299
0:15:14,880 --> 0:15:15,880
 who have lifted it

300
0:15:15,880 --> 0:15:16,880
 in the parliament.

301
0:15:16,880 --> 0:15:17,880
 And just to stay for a moment

302
0:15:17,880 --> 0:15:18,880
 with this,

303
0:15:18,880 --> 0:15:19,880
 with corona

304
0:15:19,880 --> 0:15:20,880
 and the things

305
0:15:20,880 --> 0:15:21,880
 that it has done

306
0:15:21,880 --> 0:15:22,880
 with Danish politics,

307
0:15:22,880 --> 0:15:23,880
 a relatively new way

308
0:15:23,880 --> 0:15:24,880
 has also been introduced

309
0:15:24,880 --> 0:15:25,880
 and implemented

310
0:15:25,880 --> 0:15:26,880
 during the pandemic,

311
0:15:26,880 --> 0:15:27,880
 which is the concept

312
0:15:27,880 --> 0:15:28,880
 of the solar reduction clause.

313
0:15:28,880 --> 0:15:29,880
 That is, the fact

314
0:15:29,880 --> 0:15:30,880
 that the law must run out

315
0:15:30,880 --> 0:15:31,880
 at a certain time.

316
0:15:31,880 --> 0:15:32,880
 How have you experienced

317
0:15:32,880 --> 0:15:33,880
 it as a tool

318
0:15:33,880 --> 0:15:34,880
 used in the parliament?

319
0:15:34,880 --> 0:15:35,880
 Is it something

320
0:15:35,880 --> 0:15:36,880
 that people are good at

321
0:15:36,880 --> 0:15:37,880
 among politicians?

322
0:15:37,880 --> 0:15:38,880
 Well,

323
0:15:38,880 --> 0:15:39,880
 I think it's important

324
0:15:39,880 --> 0:15:40,880
 to have a plan

325
0:15:40,880 --> 0:15:41,880
 for what to do

326
0:15:41,880 --> 0:15:42,880
 and what not to do

327
0:15:42,880 --> 0:15:43,880
 among politicians.

328
0:15:43,880 --> 0:15:44,880
 Yes,

329
0:15:44,880 --> 0:15:45,880
 you can say

330
0:15:45,880 --> 0:15:46,880
 that not all laws

331
0:15:46,880 --> 0:15:47,880
 make sense

332
0:15:47,880 --> 0:15:48,880
 to have a solar reduction clause

333
0:15:48,880 --> 0:15:49,880
 on.

334
0:15:49,880 --> 0:15:50,880
 Some of them

335
0:15:50,880 --> 0:15:51,880
 must be there.

336
0:15:51,880 --> 0:15:52,880
 But it is clear

337
0:15:52,880 --> 0:15:53,880
 that when we make

338
0:15:53,880 --> 0:15:54,880
 measures

339
0:15:54,880 --> 0:15:55,880
 that are very aggressive,

340
0:15:55,880 --> 0:15:56,880
 then I think

341
0:15:56,880 --> 0:15:57,880
 it is completely reasonable

342
0:15:57,880 --> 0:15:58,880
 that we have

343
0:15:58,880 --> 0:15:59,880
 a solar reduction clause

344
0:15:59,880 --> 0:16:00,880
 on.

345
0:16:00,880 --> 0:16:01,880
 And then, of course,

346
0:16:01,880 --> 0:16:02,880
 we have to re-investigate

347
0:16:02,880 --> 0:16:03,880
 and see if it should be extended

348
0:16:03,880 --> 0:16:04,880
 if now,

349
0:16:04,880 --> 0:16:05,880
 I mean,

350
0:16:05,880 --> 0:16:06,880
 we are in a good place,

351
0:16:06,880 --> 0:16:07,880
 but if now the epidemic

352
0:16:07,880 --> 0:16:08,880
 is still completely gone

353
0:16:08,880 --> 0:16:09,880
 and then we have to look

354
0:16:09,880 --> 0:16:10,880
 at it again.

355
0:16:10,880 --> 0:16:11,880
 But I think

356
0:16:11,880 --> 0:16:12,880
 it is a good security

357
0:16:12,880 --> 0:16:13,880
 principle.

358
0:16:13,880 --> 0:16:14,880
 And the reason

359
0:16:14,880 --> 0:16:15,880
 I think it is important

360
0:16:15,880 --> 0:16:16,880
 and I generally

361
0:16:16,880 --> 0:16:17,880
 look at it is that

362
0:16:17,880 --> 0:16:18,880
 you can just see

363
0:16:18,880 --> 0:16:19,880
 some of the actions

364
0:16:19,880 --> 0:16:20,880
 that have been made

365
0:16:20,880 --> 0:16:21,880
 in Denmark,

366
0:16:21,880 --> 0:16:22,880
 but to a large extent

367
0:16:22,880 --> 0:16:23,880
 in other countries,

368
0:16:23,880 --> 0:16:24,880
 are extremely aggressive.

369
0:16:24,880 --> 0:16:25,880
 And you just have

370
0:16:25,880 --> 0:16:26,880
 to be careful

371
0:16:26,880 --> 0:16:27,880
 not to be able

372
0:16:27,880 --> 0:16:28,880
 to normalize

373
0:16:28,880 --> 0:16:29,880
 something that is

374
0:16:29,880 --> 0:16:30,880
 in direct conflict

375
0:16:30,880 --> 0:16:31,880
 with how we normally

376
0:16:31,880 --> 0:16:32,880
 have a free

377
0:16:32,880 --> 0:16:33,880
 democratic society.

378
0:16:33,880 --> 0:16:34,880
 And it is,

379
0:16:34,880 --> 0:16:35,880
 I mean,

380
0:16:35,880 --> 0:16:36,880
 it has been

381
0:16:36,880 --> 0:16:37,880
 an extraordinary situation

382
0:16:37,880 --> 0:16:38,880
 and I agree

383
0:16:38,880 --> 0:16:39,880
 with the things

384
0:16:39,880 --> 0:16:40,880
 that have been said

385
0:16:40,880 --> 0:16:41,880
 that there are

386
0:16:41,880 --> 0:16:42,880
 clear limits

387
0:16:42,880 --> 0:16:43,880
 for how long

388
0:16:43,880 --> 0:16:44,880
 something should last,

389
0:16:44,880 --> 0:16:45,880
 when it should last,

390
0:16:45,880 --> 0:16:46,880
 how extensive it should be

391
0:16:46,880 --> 0:16:47,880
 and that is why

392
0:16:47,880 --> 0:16:48,880
 the Social Security

393
0:16:48,880 --> 0:16:49,880
 Commission

394
0:16:49,880 --> 0:16:50,880
 is just doing it

395
0:16:50,880 --> 0:16:51,880
 in a completely

396
0:16:51,880 --> 0:16:52,880
 obvious way.

397
0:16:52,880 --> 0:16:53,880
 Because then it does not

398
0:16:53,880 --> 0:16:54,880
 require anything,

399
0:16:54,880 --> 0:16:55,880
 then it completely

400
0:16:55,880 --> 0:16:56,880
 cuts itself off.

401
0:16:56,880 --> 0:16:57,880
 And that is

402
0:16:57,880 --> 0:16:58,880
 a great security

403
0:16:58,880 --> 0:16:59,880
 for,

404
0:16:59,880 --> 0:17:00,880
 because I think

405
0:17:00,880 --> 0:17:01,880
 there is a tendency

406
0:17:01,880 --> 0:17:02,880
 to,

407
0:17:02,880 --> 0:17:03,880
 and I am talking

408
0:17:03,880 --> 0:17:04,880
 in general

409
0:17:04,880 --> 0:17:05,880
 about power,

410
0:17:05,880 --> 0:17:06,880
 not just in Denmark,

411
0:17:06,880 --> 0:17:07,880
 but in the world

412
0:17:07,880 --> 0:17:08,880
 as such,

413
0:17:08,880 --> 0:17:09,880
 because it is

414
0:17:09,880 --> 0:17:10,880
 very nice

415
0:17:10,880 --> 0:17:11,880
 to have.

416
0:17:11,880 --> 0:17:12,880
 And it gives

417
0:17:12,880 --> 0:17:13,880
 some maneuvers

418
0:17:13,880 --> 0:17:14,880
 that we may not

419
0:17:14,880 --> 0:17:15,880
 have had before.

420
0:17:15,880 --> 0:17:16,880
 And that is why

421
0:17:16,880 --> 0:17:17,880
 it is important

422
0:17:17,880 --> 0:17:18,880
 that we make sure

423
0:17:18,880 --> 0:17:19,880
 that it is not

424
0:17:19,880 --> 0:17:20,880
 only for free.

425
0:17:20,880 --> 0:17:21,880
 And that is one way

426
0:17:21,880 --> 0:17:22,880
 we can do it.

427
0:17:22,880 --> 0:17:23,880
 And I think

428
0:17:23,880 --> 0:17:24,880
 it is extremely important

429
0:17:24,880 --> 0:17:25,880
 that we have been

430
0:17:25,880 --> 0:17:26,880
 able to do this

431
0:17:26,880 --> 0:17:27,880
 along the way.

432
0:17:27,880 --> 0:17:28,880
 And as I said,

433
0:17:28,880 --> 0:17:29,880
 it is not a critique

434
0:17:29,880 --> 0:17:30,880
 of specific ministers,

435
0:17:30,880 --> 0:17:31,880
 I think it is more

436
0:17:31,880 --> 0:17:32,880
 how the system is,

437
0:17:32,880 --> 0:17:33,880
 both in Denmark

438
0:17:33,880 --> 0:17:34,880
 and in other countries,

439
0:17:34,880 --> 0:17:35,880
 that when you have

440
0:17:35,880 --> 0:17:36,880
 first got

441
0:17:36,880 --> 0:17:37,880
 the department,

442
0:17:37,880 --> 0:17:38,880
 there is a lot

443
0:17:38,880 --> 0:17:39,880
 to do.

444
0:17:39,880 --> 0:17:40,880
 There is one more

445
0:17:40,880 --> 0:17:41,880
 question

446
0:17:41,880 --> 0:17:42,880
 from the audience.

447
0:17:42,880 --> 0:17:43,880
 Yes,

448
0:17:43,880 --> 0:17:44,880
 it is me again.

449
0:17:44,880 --> 0:17:45,880
 I think

450
0:17:45,880 --> 0:17:46,880
 it is fine

451
0:17:46,880 --> 0:17:47,880
 to have

452
0:17:47,880 --> 0:17:48,880
 solar power

453
0:17:48,880 --> 0:17:49,880
 clauses,

454
0:17:49,880 --> 0:17:50,880
 and it is also

455
0:17:50,880 --> 0:17:51,880
 very nice

456
0:17:51,880 --> 0:17:52,880
 to introduce

457
0:17:52,880 --> 0:17:53,880
 a law that

458
0:17:53,880 --> 0:17:54,880
 there should be

459
0:17:54,880 --> 0:17:55,880
 a revision,

460
0:17:55,880 --> 0:17:56,880
 for example.

461
0:17:56,880 --> 0:17:57,880
 But we have

462
0:17:57,880 --> 0:17:58,880
 a tendency

463
0:17:58,880 --> 0:17:59,880
 that it is used

464
0:17:59,880 --> 0:18:00,880
 as a critique

465
0:18:00,880 --> 0:18:01,880
 of what is

466
0:18:01,880 --> 0:18:02,880
 introduced.

467
0:18:02,880 --> 0:18:03,880
 And since

468
0:18:03,880 --> 0:18:04,880
 with,

469
0:18:04,880 --> 0:18:05,880
 for example,

470
0:18:05,880 --> 0:18:06,880
 the revision

471
0:18:06,880 --> 0:18:08,880
 of a solar power

472
0:18:08,880 --> 0:18:09,880
 clause,

473
0:18:09,880 --> 0:18:10,880
 we have

474
0:18:10,880 --> 0:18:11,880
 a lot of

475
0:18:11,880 --> 0:18:12,880
 issues

476
0:18:12,880 --> 0:18:13,880
 with the

477
0:18:13,880 --> 0:18:14,880
 solution of

478
0:18:14,880 --> 0:18:15,880
 the

479
0:18:15,880 --> 0:18:16,880
 solar power

480
0:18:16,880 --> 0:18:17,880
 clause.

481
0:18:17,880 --> 0:18:18,880
 And this

482
0:18:18,880 --> 0:18:19,880
 is not

483
0:18:19,880 --> 0:18:20,880
 a problem

484
0:18:20,880 --> 0:18:21,880
 with

485
0:18:21,880 --> 0:18:22,880
 the

486
0:18:22,880 --> 0:18:23,880
 solution

487
0:18:23,880 --> 0:18:24,880
 of

488
0:18:24,880 --> 0:18:25,880
 the

489
0:18:25,880 --> 0:18:26,880
 solar power

490
0:18:26,880 --> 0:18:27,880
 clause,

491
0:18:27,880 --> 0:18:28,880
 but it

492
0:18:28,880 --> 0:18:29,880
 is a problem

493
0:18:29,880 --> 0:18:30,880
 with

494
0:18:30,880 --> 0:18:31,880
 the

495
0:18:31,880 --> 0:18:32,880
 solution

496
0:18:32,880 --> 0:18:33,880
 of

497
0:18:33,880 --> 0:18:34,880
 the

498
0:18:34,880 --> 0:18:35,880
 solution

499
0:18:35,880 --> 0:18:39,880
 look at what is being implemented, because that is what is happening now.

500
0:18:39,880 --> 0:18:42,880
 That's some really good points, and I think it's embarrassing,

501
0:18:42,880 --> 0:18:45,880
 and I'm talking specifically about the lockdown, that it's still going on,

502
0:18:45,880 --> 0:18:49,880
 because it's completely absurd, and I just don't get it.

503
0:18:49,880 --> 0:18:53,880
 And it shows that you're right, it's not a safe system,

504
0:18:53,880 --> 0:18:58,880
 because if there isn't a majority that actually supports what they've agreed on,

505
0:18:58,880 --> 0:19:01,880
 then it doesn't matter. So you're right about that.

506
0:19:01,880 --> 0:19:04,880
 Now I'm talking specifically about the promises I've been a part of,

507
0:19:04,880 --> 0:19:12,880
 and I want to say, if you look at the first law we made in March last year,

508
0:19:12,880 --> 0:19:17,880
 when we made a gas bill on it, it was because no one could overlook

509
0:19:17,880 --> 0:19:19,880
 the full consequences of what we had done.

510
0:19:19,880 --> 0:19:22,880
 And the important thing we have to say about this, is that it's completely out of control,

511
0:19:22,880 --> 0:19:27,880
 because otherwise, we'd never get rid of it again.

512
0:19:27,880 --> 0:19:31,880
 But that's not ideal at all. That's not how a law should be adopted.

513
0:19:31,880 --> 0:19:34,880
 A law should have a proper process where you have a debate,

514
0:19:34,880 --> 0:19:37,880
 where you hear the debate, get input from all the relevant parties,

515
0:19:37,880 --> 0:19:40,880
 and then a law is adopted, and you can actually step back.

516
0:19:40,880 --> 0:19:43,880
 And that was the process we had afterwards,

517
0:19:43,880 --> 0:19:46,880
 and was adopted here at the beginning of the year,

518
0:19:46,880 --> 0:19:49,880
 the new epidemic law, which is still the old one.

519
0:19:49,880 --> 0:19:52,880
 And we've had a hearing process, and we've taken the debate in.

520
0:19:52,880 --> 0:19:55,880
 Again, this time, we haven't chosen a gas bill,

521
0:19:55,880 --> 0:19:58,880
 because we have to have an epidemic law, and we've always had one.

522
0:19:58,880 --> 0:20:02,880
 But what I was told was that we have to make sure that we follow up,

523
0:20:02,880 --> 0:20:05,880
 that we follow up on the criticism that has been raised here,

524
0:20:05,880 --> 0:20:08,880
 when we've had this law in effect for a few months,

525
0:20:08,880 --> 0:20:11,880
 and see if something needs to be adapted.

526
0:20:11,880 --> 0:20:15,880
 So it's not a gas bill, it's an agreement that we review the law,

527
0:20:15,880 --> 0:20:18,880
 and revise the areas where there is a reason to revise,

528
0:20:18,880 --> 0:20:21,880
 based on the input we get from different parties.

529
0:20:21,880 --> 0:20:26,880
 And there are several who have already referred to me in my role as a representative for the epidemic election,

530
0:20:26,880 --> 0:20:29,880
 and have said that we have some things here that we should look at.

531
0:20:29,880 --> 0:20:32,880
 And I think that's an important way to do it.

532
0:20:32,880 --> 0:20:37,880
 And I think that's a better way than just making a gas bill.

533
0:20:37,880 --> 0:20:43,880
 So I agree that it's easy to just use it as an excuse to listen to criticism,

534
0:20:43,880 --> 0:20:46,880
 because you've taken a lot from everything, and it's up to you.

535
0:20:46,880 --> 0:20:47,880
 And that's not the idea.

536
0:20:47,880 --> 0:20:50,880
 We have to have the input process, we have to have the hearing process,

537
0:20:50,880 --> 0:20:52,880
 we have to have input from relevant parties,

538
0:20:52,880 --> 0:20:56,880
 and then we have to apply the law according to the input that comes.

539
0:20:56,880 --> 0:20:59,880
 There's a follow-up.

540
0:20:59,880 --> 0:21:01,880
 Yes.

541
0:21:01,880 --> 0:21:08,880
 Yes, as a citizen, I'd much rather have you not introduce anything you're in doubt about.

542
0:21:08,880 --> 0:21:13,880
 And we all know that if you have a chaotic, panic situation,

543
0:21:13,880 --> 0:21:16,880
 then you have different types of crime, and I'm not a lawyer,

544
0:21:16,880 --> 0:21:18,880
 but in Denmark you can do a lot of things.

545
0:21:18,880 --> 0:21:22,880
 So even without the epidemic law, with the gross things written into them,

546
0:21:22,880 --> 0:21:27,880
 and the hearing process may not have been as fantastic and thought-through as it should have been,

547
0:21:27,880 --> 0:21:29,880
 then it's better to just let it out.

548
0:21:29,880 --> 0:21:30,880
 Just let it out.

549
0:21:30,880 --> 0:21:33,880
 And if there's a need for it, then there are different types of crimes.

550
0:21:33,880 --> 0:21:37,880
 If there's someone running around spreading infection on the street,

551
0:21:37,880 --> 0:21:41,880
 then there's no one who wants to prevent the police from arresting the victims,

552
0:21:41,880 --> 0:21:43,880
 using other laws, taking them in.

553
0:21:43,880 --> 0:21:45,880
 And as I understand it, as the lawyers have said,

554
0:21:45,880 --> 0:21:48,880
 then there's already the possibility of doing things.

555
0:21:48,880 --> 0:21:50,880
 Among other things, with double penalties and things like that,

556
0:21:50,880 --> 0:21:52,880
 then there can already be sharp circumstances.

557
0:21:52,880 --> 0:21:58,880
 So instead of trying to tackle some special situations that the pandemic is in,

558
0:21:58,880 --> 0:21:59,880
 because it actually isn't.

559
0:21:59,880 --> 0:22:02,880
 Now it's a bit rough, but the pandemic isn't a special situation.

560
0:22:02,880 --> 0:22:06,880
 It's part of our current society, which has a wave of problems,

561
0:22:06,880 --> 0:22:09,880
 and which we can't simply stop.

562
0:22:09,880 --> 0:22:13,880
 So to be honest, we probably shouldn't have the epidemic law.

563
0:22:13,880 --> 0:22:16,880
 I don't agree with you on that.

564
0:22:16,880 --> 0:22:21,880
 There are two epidemic laws here, or actually there are three.

565
0:22:21,880 --> 0:22:27,880
 The one you're rightfully criticizing was the process we had at the start,

566
0:22:27,880 --> 0:22:28,880
 just before the lockdown.

567
0:22:28,880 --> 0:22:31,880
 Where we discussed all this.

568
0:22:31,880 --> 0:22:36,880
 The process was too hasty, and wasn't optimal in any way.

569
0:22:36,880 --> 0:22:40,880
 And I've said that myself, and it's been revealed and described.

570
0:22:40,880 --> 0:22:44,880
 We've had an investigation of this whole process, because it was extremely chaotic.

571
0:22:44,880 --> 0:22:46,880
 And it's not a way of taking such a comprehensive law into account.

572
0:22:46,880 --> 0:22:48,880
 I totally agree with you on that.

573
0:22:48,880 --> 0:22:51,880
 But not having an epidemic law is not a solution either.

574
0:22:51,880 --> 0:22:54,880
 Because some of what you're mentioning here, well, you can't just do it.

575
0:22:54,880 --> 0:22:56,880
 It requires a law firm to do it.

576
0:22:56,880 --> 0:22:59,880
 And the government has also learned, in the harshest way,

577
0:22:59,880 --> 0:23:02,880
 that you can't just do things without ensuring that there's actually an improvement in the law.

578
0:23:02,880 --> 0:23:05,880
 And the epidemic law has been used for a lot of things, even earlier.

579
0:23:05,880 --> 0:23:08,880
 For example, it's not just epidemics, despite the name.

580
0:23:08,880 --> 0:23:12,880
 It's also if there's a terrorist attack, someone who spreads a poison,

581
0:23:12,880 --> 0:23:14,880
 we have to close down a station or something,

582
0:23:14,880 --> 0:23:17,880
 then it's also the law that needs to be used.

583
0:23:17,880 --> 0:23:20,880
 And there are other provisions in it that have also been used earlier.

584
0:23:20,880 --> 0:23:24,880
 So when there's a person who has meningitis at a school, for example,

585
0:23:24,880 --> 0:23:25,880
 then it's also based on the epidemic law.

586
0:23:25,880 --> 0:23:28,880
 Not because it's a society-based disease, but because it's based on the law.

587
0:23:28,880 --> 0:23:29,880
 Other paragraphs.

588
0:23:29,880 --> 0:23:34,880
 You can go in and make sure to close a school, get vaccinated children, etc.

589
0:23:34,880 --> 0:23:37,880
 So it has been used, and has been used numerous times, also in our lifetime,

590
0:23:37,880 --> 0:23:40,880
 just not on the scale we've seen here.

591
0:23:40,880 --> 0:23:43,880
 So we need an epidemic law, but we need an epidemic law that makes sense.

592
0:23:43,880 --> 0:23:46,880
 The problem with the old one, that is, the one that was in the past,

593
0:23:46,880 --> 0:23:49,880
 from the whole corona period, was that it hadn't been revised for a long time.

594
0:23:49,880 --> 0:23:54,880
 And that means that some of the mechanisms, some of the ways it was built up,

595
0:23:55,880 --> 0:23:57,880
 were from a different time.

596
0:23:57,880 --> 0:24:03,880
 It was much more based on a ship with pests that lies in Aarhus harbour.

597
0:24:03,880 --> 0:24:04,880
 How do we handle that?

598
0:24:04,880 --> 0:24:08,880
 It wasn't built with a society in mind, where people fly around on crosses and across,

599
0:24:08,880 --> 0:24:11,880
 and we can't control the spread of infection in the same way.

600
0:24:11,880 --> 0:24:14,880
 So we simply need to have a modern, revised epidemic law.

601
0:24:14,880 --> 0:24:17,880
 But it was also important, and I've spent a lot of time on this,

602
0:24:17,880 --> 0:24:21,880
 to introduce justice, the Institute for Human Rights,

603
0:24:21,880 --> 0:24:24,880
 all these relevant people, to hear, okay, how do we find a balance?

604
0:24:25,880 --> 0:24:29,880
 How do we find a balance between the Institute's rights and the society's demands on protection?

605
0:24:29,880 --> 0:24:32,880
 And I think we've actually reached a really good point.

606
0:24:32,880 --> 0:24:37,880
 The process that has been here with the new, that is, the law we adopted last year,

607
0:24:37,880 --> 0:24:42,880
 that I'm fully committed to, and that law is much, much better than the one we had before.

608
0:24:42,880 --> 0:24:45,880
 When we still made it clear that we wanted to revise some things,

609
0:24:45,880 --> 0:24:47,880
 there were some other places I've looked at.

610
0:24:47,880 --> 0:24:50,880
 It was more of these new control mechanisms that I've been able to introduce,

611
0:24:50,880 --> 0:24:54,880
 with an epidemic commission, with external experts, with openness about the study framework, and all this.

612
0:24:55,880 --> 0:25:00,880
 That's what I really want to make sure of when we get to the year after.

613
0:25:00,880 --> 0:25:03,880
 That we have something that we need to adapt,

614
0:25:03,880 --> 0:25:06,880
 because I'm not sure it was exactly the way we wanted it to be.

615
0:25:06,880 --> 0:25:08,880
 And that's the part I'm thinking about.

616
0:25:08,880 --> 0:25:11,880
 I'd like to try to switch a little bit of the subject to,

617
0:25:11,880 --> 0:25:13,880
 you were already talking about it a while ago,

618
0:25:13,880 --> 0:25:16,880
 it was perhaps a question about the declaration of lockdown,

619
0:25:16,880 --> 0:25:19,880
 which we've had a lot of trouble with here in the country,

620
0:25:19,880 --> 0:25:22,880
 which has now become unlawful for quite a number of occasions,

621
0:25:22,880 --> 0:25:24,880
 and which is still going on, so to speak.

622
0:25:25,880 --> 0:25:27,880
 It's a bit of a strange thing.

623
0:25:27,880 --> 0:25:31,880
 How do you deal with the fact that the police and the Ministry of Justice,

624
0:25:31,880 --> 0:25:33,880
 for a long time,

625
0:25:33,880 --> 0:25:36,880
 openly believe that we need to have control over the citizens' phones,

626
0:25:36,880 --> 0:25:39,880
 that is, who calls whom and where they are,

627
0:25:39,880 --> 0:25:42,880
 and insist, and are very hard-headed about,

628
0:25:42,880 --> 0:25:44,880
 holding on to this warning?

629
0:25:44,880 --> 0:25:46,880
 Do you think we can't avoid that?

630
0:25:46,880 --> 0:25:50,880
 Is it necessary for the state to know where the citizens are and who they're talking to?

631
0:25:50,880 --> 0:25:52,880
 No, it's not necessary.

632
0:25:52,880 --> 0:25:54,880
 And no, I don't mean, of course not,

633
0:25:55,880 --> 0:25:57,880
 to overlook the citizens of the country,

634
0:25:57,880 --> 0:26:00,880
 just because you might theoretically use it.

635
0:26:00,880 --> 0:26:03,880
 You can also discuss whether it is something you can use in practice.

636
0:26:03,880 --> 0:26:08,880
 But even if it was, then it doesn't help that we're doing something illegal,

637
0:26:08,880 --> 0:26:12,880
 i.e. preserving data, because we might want to use it at a later date.

638
0:26:12,880 --> 0:26:14,880
 It's simply not in order.

639
0:26:14,880 --> 0:26:15,880
 So I can answer that quite clearly.

640
0:26:15,880 --> 0:26:17,880
 No, I don't think we should.

641
0:26:19,880 --> 0:26:23,880
 At an unusual time, there is a new declaration of lockdown on the way,

642
0:26:23,880 --> 0:26:25,880
 which, as I understand it,

643
0:26:25,880 --> 0:26:27,880
 in the past years,

644
0:26:27,880 --> 0:26:29,880
 has been put in place by the Ministry of Justice.

645
0:26:29,880 --> 0:26:31,880
 You will no longer only lock when you call each other,

646
0:26:31,880 --> 0:26:33,880
 because that's obviously the problem,

647
0:26:33,880 --> 0:26:34,880
 or when you text each other,

648
0:26:34,880 --> 0:26:35,880
 so you will keep that in mind.

649
0:26:35,880 --> 0:26:38,880
 On the other hand, you will lock when the phone is just lying passively on a table,

650
0:26:38,880 --> 0:26:40,880
 and is registering itself,

651
0:26:40,880 --> 0:26:43,880
 which de facto leads to more locking.

652
0:26:43,880 --> 0:26:46,880
 Is that something you are already paying attention to,

653
0:26:46,880 --> 0:26:47,880
 as IT officer?

654
0:26:47,880 --> 0:26:50,880
 Is that something you might want to keep an eye on?

655
0:26:50,880 --> 0:26:52,880
 The problem with this, I must say,

656
0:26:52,880 --> 0:26:54,880
 has been that it has not been in the hands of me,

657
0:26:54,880 --> 0:26:57,880
 nor of our legal advisor,

658
0:26:57,880 --> 0:27:00,880
 who has just changed hands again,

659
0:27:00,880 --> 0:27:01,880
 as is known.

660
0:27:01,880 --> 0:27:03,880
 But it is something I am aware of,

661
0:27:03,880 --> 0:27:05,880
 and it is something we are of course doing,

662
0:27:05,880 --> 0:27:07,880
 because it is extremely problematic.

663
0:27:07,880 --> 0:27:10,880
 I am of the clear conviction

664
0:27:10,880 --> 0:27:13,880
 that I would rather have confidence in the future than concern.

665
0:27:13,880 --> 0:27:17,880
 I do not subscribe to the idea that more concern creates more freedom.

666
0:27:17,880 --> 0:27:18,880
 On the contrary.

667
0:27:18,880 --> 0:27:21,880
 And this is, as you yourself say,

668
0:27:21,880 --> 0:27:23,880
 it has been known to be illegal,

669
0:27:23,880 --> 0:27:24,880
 I do not know how many times,

670
0:27:24,880 --> 0:27:26,880
 and the process has been very remarkable,

671
0:27:26,880 --> 0:27:27,880
 because it has been thrown into the corner,

672
0:27:27,880 --> 0:27:28,880
 saying that something new is coming,

673
0:27:28,880 --> 0:27:29,880
 and that is what we expect.

674
0:27:29,880 --> 0:27:31,880
 But without being a lawyer,

675
0:27:31,880 --> 0:27:32,880
 it is my clear opinion

676
0:27:32,880 --> 0:27:34,880
 that there is really nothing to discuss here.

677
0:27:34,880 --> 0:27:36,880
 It is not legal.

678
0:27:36,880 --> 0:27:38,880
 So we are very aware of that.

679
0:27:38,880 --> 0:27:42,880
 And when we will be invited to discuss it further,

680
0:27:42,880 --> 0:27:43,880
 I do not know,

681
0:27:43,880 --> 0:27:44,880
 but I will have to think about it,

682
0:27:44,880 --> 0:27:47,880
 to hear what the process will actually become.

683
0:27:47,880 --> 0:27:50,880
 There is a question from some chat here.

684
0:27:51,880 --> 0:27:53,880
 So we have received a question from the internet,

685
0:27:53,880 --> 0:27:54,880
 where it says,

686
0:27:54,880 --> 0:27:56,880
 what is your opinion on the various DNS blockades

687
0:27:56,880 --> 0:27:57,880
 that we introduce in Denmark,

688
0:27:57,880 --> 0:28:00,880
 for example blockades on websites like gambling?

689
0:28:00,880 --> 0:28:04,880
 Is it really necessary to introduce censorship?

690
0:28:04,880 --> 0:28:10,880
 Thanks for the question to the internet.

691
0:28:10,880 --> 0:28:11,880
 On that day,

692
0:28:11,880 --> 0:28:12,880
 no, censorship,

693
0:28:12,880 --> 0:28:14,880
 that is something you have to avoid,

694
0:28:14,880 --> 0:28:16,880
 but as I understand the problem here,

695
0:28:16,880 --> 0:28:18,880
 we also close sides,

696
0:28:18,880 --> 0:28:20,880
 such as holding child porn, for example,

697
0:28:20,880 --> 0:28:21,880
 and others.

698
0:28:21,880 --> 0:28:22,880
 There is no discussion about it,

699
0:28:22,880 --> 0:28:23,880
 we do not want it.

700
0:28:23,880 --> 0:28:25,880
 If there are other ways to do it,

701
0:28:25,880 --> 0:28:27,880
 it is simply not enough in the security of IT

702
0:28:27,880 --> 0:28:28,880
 to be the right thing to answer.

703
0:28:28,880 --> 0:28:30,880
 So if any of you have any good input there,

704
0:28:30,880 --> 0:28:31,880
 then you can get a hold of me,

705
0:28:31,880 --> 0:28:34,880
 because I am not smart enough to come up with another solution.

706
0:28:34,880 --> 0:28:35,880
 But it is completely up to you,

707
0:28:35,880 --> 0:28:38,880
 and it depends on what the question really points to.

708
0:28:38,880 --> 0:28:40,880
 How do we make sure that it is not abused?

709
0:28:40,880 --> 0:28:42,880
 Because we know that if you say yes to one thing,

710
0:28:42,880 --> 0:28:44,880
 then it can be very easy to be used for something

711
0:28:44,880 --> 0:28:45,880
 that was not meant,

712
0:28:45,880 --> 0:28:47,880
 suddenly closed down on some sides,

713
0:28:47,880 --> 0:28:49,880
 where it does not make sense.

714
0:28:49,880 --> 0:28:50,880
 And that is of course,

715
0:28:50,880 --> 0:28:54,880
 a very important thing to focus on,

716
0:28:54,880 --> 0:28:57,880
 that you do not actually impose censorship

717
0:28:57,880 --> 0:28:59,880
 of completely legitimate sides.

718
0:28:59,880 --> 0:29:00,880
 And as I said,

719
0:29:00,880 --> 0:29:02,880
 I do not have a easy answer to it,

720
0:29:02,880 --> 0:29:03,880
 but if any of you have any input,

721
0:29:03,880 --> 0:29:05,880
 then you are welcome to contact me,

722
0:29:05,880 --> 0:29:07,880
 either here now or afterwards.

723
0:29:07,880 --> 0:29:09,880
 My email is available,

724
0:29:09,880 --> 0:29:10,880
 and you know where I work,

725
0:29:10,880 --> 0:29:12,880
 so it should be relatively easy.

726
0:29:13,880 --> 0:29:15,880
 I would like to come up with something,

727
0:29:15,880 --> 0:29:16,880
 I will also repeat to the audience,

728
0:29:16,880 --> 0:29:18,880
 if there are any who have any questions,

729
0:29:18,880 --> 0:29:19,880
 then you just wave a little with your arm,

730
0:29:19,880 --> 0:29:21,880
 and then you can stand up in front of the microphone,

731
0:29:21,880 --> 0:29:23,880
 and then you can ask the question.

732
0:29:23,880 --> 0:29:24,880
 But one of the things I was thinking about,

733
0:29:24,880 --> 0:29:25,880
 that we might also talk about,

734
0:29:25,880 --> 0:29:28,880
 is our relationship to artificial intelligence,

735
0:29:28,880 --> 0:29:30,880
 which is something that at the moment

736
0:29:30,880 --> 0:29:31,880
 is very popular,

737
0:29:31,880 --> 0:29:32,880
 is my impression of it,

738
0:29:32,880 --> 0:29:33,880
 within Christiansborg,

739
0:29:33,880 --> 0:29:34,880
 and also in the private business world,

740
0:29:34,880 --> 0:29:36,880
 as it is what should save us all economically,

741
0:29:36,880 --> 0:29:38,880
 and becomes incredibly smart,

742
0:29:38,880 --> 0:29:39,880
 and one thing or another,

743
0:29:39,880 --> 0:29:42,880
 and there have already been different solutions

744
0:29:42,880 --> 0:29:44,880
 out among job centers,

745
0:29:44,880 --> 0:29:46,880
 which should evaluate whether you are ready to work,

746
0:29:46,880 --> 0:29:47,880
 with the help of machine learning,

747
0:29:47,880 --> 0:29:48,880
 and some things like that.

748
0:29:48,880 --> 0:29:50,880
 And there have been some systems,

749
0:29:50,880 --> 0:29:51,880
 that have been made,

750
0:29:51,880 --> 0:29:53,880
 where you should evaluate whether children are exposed,

751
0:29:53,880 --> 0:29:55,880
 with the help of artificial intelligence.

752
0:29:55,880 --> 0:29:56,880
 How do you think,

753
0:29:56,880 --> 0:30:00,880
 that Denmark is grasping this new technology?

754
0:30:00,880 --> 0:30:01,880
 Are we doing it right,

755
0:30:01,880 --> 0:30:03,880
 or are we just going to test new technology,

756
0:30:03,880 --> 0:30:06,880
 on exposed groups?

757
0:30:07,880 --> 0:30:08,880
 First of all,

758
0:30:08,880 --> 0:30:10,880
 I think there has to be a step

759
0:30:10,880 --> 0:30:12,880
 in the use of the terms.

760
0:30:12,880 --> 0:30:14,880
 When we talk about artificial intelligence,

761
0:30:14,880 --> 0:30:15,880
 it's just that you make a linear regression,

762
0:30:15,880 --> 0:30:16,880
 then it is artificial intelligence,

763
0:30:16,880 --> 0:30:17,880
 suddenly,

764
0:30:17,880 --> 0:30:21,880
 and I think that's a bit of an exaggeration of the concept,

765
0:30:21,880 --> 0:30:23,880
 but let it be.

766
0:30:23,880 --> 0:30:25,880
 What we are talking about is,

767
0:30:25,880 --> 0:30:27,880
 how can we analyze large data sets,

768
0:30:27,880 --> 0:30:29,880
 and find answers to specific questions.

769
0:30:29,880 --> 0:30:30,880
 There is no doubt about it,

770
0:30:30,880 --> 0:30:31,880
 that's also what I've been doing,

771
0:30:31,880 --> 0:30:32,880
 you mentioned some of the places,

772
0:30:32,880 --> 0:30:33,880
 where I have worked before,

773
0:30:33,880 --> 0:30:34,880
 that's what I've been doing,

774
0:30:34,880 --> 0:30:35,880
 mostly throughout my career,

775
0:30:35,880 --> 0:30:38,880
 there has been some form of artificial intelligence,

776
0:30:38,880 --> 0:30:39,880
 machine learning,

777
0:30:39,880 --> 0:30:40,880
 analysis of large data sets,

778
0:30:40,880 --> 0:30:43,880
 answering questions about patients,

779
0:30:43,880 --> 0:30:44,880
 or the effects of medicine,

780
0:30:44,880 --> 0:30:45,880
 or whatever it may be.

781
0:30:45,880 --> 0:30:46,880
 And it works,

782
0:30:46,880 --> 0:30:48,880
 there is a reason why we use it

783
0:30:48,880 --> 0:30:49,880
 so much in the research world.

784
0:30:49,880 --> 0:30:51,880
 It is clear that it can be used

785
0:30:51,880 --> 0:30:52,880
 really, really well.

786
0:30:52,880 --> 0:30:54,880
 You just have to know what you are doing,

787
0:30:54,880 --> 0:30:56,880
 and you have to know that

788
0:30:56,880 --> 0:30:58,880
 when you use such a black box,

789
0:30:58,880 --> 0:31:00,880
 there is often built-in,

790
0:31:00,880 --> 0:31:01,880
 not consciously,

791
0:31:01,880 --> 0:31:02,880
 but there can be,

792
0:31:02,880 --> 0:31:03,880
 what is it called in Danish,

793
0:31:03,880 --> 0:31:05,880
 biases in it.

794
0:31:05,880 --> 0:31:07,880
 You get the answers,

795
0:31:07,880 --> 0:31:10,880
 that the model is made to give.

796
0:31:10,880 --> 0:31:13,880
 And that recognition is quite important,

797
0:31:13,880 --> 0:31:15,880
 to get out there and say,

798
0:31:15,880 --> 0:31:18,880
 it is not a silver bullet,

799
0:31:18,880 --> 0:31:20,880
 that solves all our problems.

800
0:31:20,880 --> 0:31:21,880
 I have said earlier,

801
0:31:21,880 --> 0:31:23,880
 when I discussed this in the health area,

802
0:31:23,880 --> 0:31:25,880
 that I do not want my doctor

803
0:31:25,880 --> 0:31:27,880
 to be replaced by a computer.

804
0:31:27,880 --> 0:31:29,880
 I would like my doctor to use a computer

805
0:31:29,880 --> 0:31:34,880
 to assist and to qualify her offer to me,

806
0:31:34,880 --> 0:31:36,880
 but I would like to have the human factor in it,

807
0:31:36,880 --> 0:31:38,880
 I would like to have the expertise in it.

808
0:31:38,880 --> 0:31:40,880
 But of course you can use this as a tool.

809
0:31:40,880 --> 0:31:43,880
 So it is a good thing to use the data you have,

810
0:31:43,880 --> 0:31:45,880
 to become smarter and do things better.

811
0:31:45,880 --> 0:31:47,880
 There is no doubt about that.

812
0:31:47,880 --> 0:31:49,880
 You just have to do it right,

813
0:31:49,880 --> 0:31:51,880
 and be aware of the fall groups there are.

814
0:31:51,880 --> 0:31:53,880
 Then you ask if you use it to,

815
0:31:53,880 --> 0:31:55,880
 if you test it on the outside.

816
0:31:55,880 --> 0:31:57,880
 In Gladsaxe municipality,

817
0:31:57,880 --> 0:31:58,880
 I think it was,

818
0:31:58,880 --> 0:31:59,880
 where you had,

819
0:31:59,880 --> 0:32:00,880
 which actually shows some of the problems,

820
0:32:00,880 --> 0:32:01,880
 I have just mentioned,

821
0:32:01,880 --> 0:32:02,880
 where you used it to see,

822
0:32:02,880 --> 0:32:04,880
 what was it,

823
0:32:04,880 --> 0:32:05,880
 vulnerable citizens,

824
0:32:05,880 --> 0:32:06,880
 so you could catch them beforehand,

825
0:32:06,880 --> 0:32:07,880
 and you can say,

826
0:32:07,880 --> 0:32:08,880
 the thought behind,

827
0:32:08,880 --> 0:32:10,880
 if you saw it was sympathetic in some way,

828
0:32:10,880 --> 0:32:12,880
 we can quickly find those who need help,

829
0:32:12,880 --> 0:32:13,880
 and help them.

830
0:32:13,880 --> 0:32:14,880
 But it just shows,

831
0:32:14,880 --> 0:32:16,880
 that the parameters you chose to use,

832
0:32:16,880 --> 0:32:17,880
 just,

833
0:32:17,880 --> 0:32:18,880
 yes,

834
0:32:18,880 --> 0:32:20,880
 just brought some very specific groups forward,

835
0:32:20,880 --> 0:32:22,880
 because that was what you asked for.

836
0:32:22,880 --> 0:32:23,880
 So you had not thought through,

837
0:32:23,880 --> 0:32:24,880
 what it really was for a model,

838
0:32:24,880 --> 0:32:25,880
 you made down over it.

839
0:32:25,880 --> 0:32:27,880
 And you are not aware of that.

840
0:32:27,880 --> 0:32:28,880
 So,

841
0:32:28,880 --> 0:32:29,880
 to answer the question,

842
0:32:29,880 --> 0:32:31,880
 if we do it right in Denmark,

843
0:32:31,880 --> 0:32:32,880
 it would be much,

844
0:32:32,880 --> 0:32:33,880
 much better,

845
0:32:33,880 --> 0:32:34,880
 if we gathered people,

846
0:32:34,880 --> 0:32:35,880
 who actually know something about it.

847
0:32:35,880 --> 0:32:36,880
 Both,

848
0:32:36,880 --> 0:32:37,880
 those who sit with the algorithms,

849
0:32:37,880 --> 0:32:39,880
 but also for some data-technical reasons,

850
0:32:39,880 --> 0:32:40,880
 to discuss,

851
0:32:40,880 --> 0:32:41,880
 what are the implications,

852
0:32:41,880 --> 0:32:42,880
 of what it could be,

853
0:32:42,880 --> 0:32:44,880
 in these different areas.

854
0:32:44,880 --> 0:32:45,880
 So,

855
0:32:45,880 --> 0:32:46,880
 if we do it right,

856
0:32:46,880 --> 0:32:47,880
 then I think,

857
0:32:47,880 --> 0:32:48,880
 there is a huge potential in this.

858
0:32:48,880 --> 0:32:49,880
 It depends on,

859
0:32:49,880 --> 0:32:50,880
 what you put in the words here.

860
0:32:50,880 --> 0:32:51,880
 Because,

861
0:32:51,880 --> 0:32:52,880
 as I say,

862
0:32:52,880 --> 0:32:53,880
 I think,

863
0:32:53,880 --> 0:32:54,880
 first of all,

864
0:32:54,880 --> 0:32:55,880
 we call everything,

865
0:32:55,880 --> 0:32:56,880
 for artificial intelligence today,

866
0:32:56,880 --> 0:32:57,880
 but let's just accept,

867
0:32:57,880 --> 0:32:58,880
 what we openly call it.

868
0:32:58,880 --> 0:32:59,880
 So,

869
0:32:59,880 --> 0:33:00,880
 it can be used,

870
0:33:00,880 --> 0:33:01,880
 really,

871
0:33:01,880 --> 0:33:02,880
 really well.

872
0:33:02,880 --> 0:33:03,880
 So,

873
0:33:03,880 --> 0:33:04,880
 when we talk about,

874
0:33:04,880 --> 0:33:05,880
 the green setting,

875
0:33:05,880 --> 0:33:06,880
 for example.

876
0:33:06,880 --> 0:33:07,880
 There is a lot of focus on,

877
0:33:07,880 --> 0:33:08,880
 how can we use data,

878
0:33:08,880 --> 0:33:09,880
 with how many running,

879
0:33:09,880 --> 0:33:10,880
 at that time.

880
0:33:10,880 --> 0:33:11,880
 Can we optimize something here,

881
0:33:11,880 --> 0:33:12,880
 so that we,

882
0:33:12,880 --> 0:33:13,880
 use energy in construction,

883
0:33:13,880 --> 0:33:14,880
 and better.

884
0:33:14,880 --> 0:33:15,880
 All kinds of,

885
0:33:15,880 --> 0:33:16,880
 there are all kinds of good things,

886
0:33:16,880 --> 0:33:17,880
 you can do with this.

887
0:33:17,880 --> 0:33:18,880
 You can also just easily,

888
0:33:18,880 --> 0:33:19,880
 come to,

889
0:33:19,880 --> 0:33:20,880
 also unconsciously,

890
0:33:20,880 --> 0:33:21,880
 to abuse it.

891
0:33:21,880 --> 0:33:22,880
 And you have to be,

892
0:33:22,880 --> 0:33:23,880
 very careful about that.

893
0:33:23,880 --> 0:33:24,880
 And that again,

894
0:33:24,880 --> 0:33:25,880
 if we talk about,

895
0:33:25,880 --> 0:33:26,880
 open source earlier.

896
0:33:26,880 --> 0:33:27,880
 Especially here,

897
0:33:27,880 --> 0:33:28,880
 it is extremely important,

898
0:33:28,880 --> 0:33:29,880
 to be open about,

899
0:33:29,880 --> 0:33:30,880
 what it is for a model,

900
0:33:30,880 --> 0:33:31,880
 you use.

901
0:33:31,880 --> 0:33:32,880
 What are the parameters,

902
0:33:32,880 --> 0:33:33,880
 you use.

903
0:33:33,880 --> 0:33:34,880
 Because this idea,

904
0:33:34,880 --> 0:33:35,880
 if you just try something,

905
0:33:35,880 --> 0:33:36,880
 down a black box,

906
0:33:36,880 --> 0:33:37,880
 and get the answer out again,

907
0:33:37,880 --> 0:33:38,880
 it is extremely dangerous.

908
0:33:38,880 --> 0:33:39,880
 It is very important,

909
0:33:39,880 --> 0:33:40,880
 to be open about,

910
0:33:40,880 --> 0:33:41,880
 how to catch these,

911
0:33:41,880 --> 0:33:42,880
 potential errors,

912
0:33:42,880 --> 0:33:43,880
 or biases,

913
0:33:43,880 --> 0:33:44,880
 that might be.

914
0:33:44,880 --> 0:33:45,880
 Question here.

915
0:33:45,880 --> 0:33:46,880
 Yes,

916
0:33:46,880 --> 0:33:47,880
 I have no questions,

917
0:33:47,880 --> 0:33:48,880
 but only a comment.

918
0:33:48,880 --> 0:33:49,880
 So,

919
0:33:49,880 --> 0:33:50,880
 I come from Germany,

920
0:33:50,880 --> 0:33:51,880
 and we have had,

921
0:33:51,880 --> 0:33:52,880
 also discussion,

922
0:33:52,880 --> 0:33:53,880
 about,

923
0:33:53,880 --> 0:33:54,880
 internet blocking,

924
0:33:54,880 --> 0:33:55,880
 against,

925
0:33:55,880 --> 0:33:56,880
 child pornography.

926
0:33:56,880 --> 0:33:57,880
 And,

927
0:33:57,880 --> 0:33:58,880
 the development,

928
0:33:58,880 --> 0:33:59,880
 was,

929
0:33:59,880 --> 0:34:00,880
 that,

930
0:34:00,880 --> 0:34:01,880
 in the end,

931
0:34:01,880 --> 0:34:02,880
 we stopped,

932
0:34:02,880 --> 0:34:03,880
 the loan.

933
0:34:03,880 --> 0:34:04,880
 We have decided,

934
0:34:04,880 --> 0:34:05,880
 that we will not have,

935
0:34:05,880 --> 0:34:06,880
 censorship,

936
0:34:06,880 --> 0:34:07,880
 we will not have,

937
0:34:07,880 --> 0:34:08,880
 DNS blockades.

938
0:34:08,880 --> 0:34:09,880
 We have,

939
0:34:09,880 --> 0:34:10,880
 a lot of,

940
0:34:10,880 --> 0:34:11,880
 decisions,

941
0:34:11,880 --> 0:34:12,880
 that are,

942
0:34:12,880 --> 0:34:13,880
 more effective,

943
0:34:13,880 --> 0:34:14,880
 than,

944
0:34:14,880 --> 0:34:15,880
 illegal,

945
0:34:15,880 --> 0:34:16,880
 content.

946
0:34:16,880 --> 0:34:17,880
 I see,

947
0:34:17,880 --> 0:34:18,880
 that,

948
0:34:18,880 --> 0:34:19,880
 it is,

949
0:34:19,880 --> 0:34:20,880
 in,

950
0:34:20,880 --> 0:34:21,880
 all cases,

951
0:34:21,880 --> 0:34:22,880
 possible,

952
0:34:22,880 --> 0:34:23,880
 to,

953
0:34:23,880 --> 0:34:24,880
 write,

954
0:34:24,880 --> 0:34:25,880
 to,

955
0:34:25,880 --> 0:34:26,880
 hosting companies,

956
0:34:26,880 --> 0:34:27,880
 so that,

957
0:34:27,880 --> 0:34:28,880
 content,

958
0:34:28,880 --> 0:34:29,880
 will be,

959
0:34:29,880 --> 0:34:30,880
 stolen.

960
0:34:30,880 --> 0:34:31,880
 We have,

961
0:34:31,880 --> 0:34:32,880
 not had,

962
0:34:32,880 --> 0:34:33,880
 discussions,

963
0:34:33,880 --> 0:34:34,880
 about gambling,

964
0:34:34,880 --> 0:34:35,880
 in,

965
0:34:35,880 --> 0:34:36,880
 Germany.

966
0:34:36,880 --> 0:34:37,880
 So,

967
0:34:37,880 --> 0:34:38,880
 I don't want,

968
0:34:38,880 --> 0:34:39,880
 to be,

969
0:34:39,880 --> 0:34:40,880
 involved,

970
0:34:40,880 --> 0:34:41,880
 in,

971
0:34:41,880 --> 0:34:42,880
 child pornography,

972
0:34:42,880 --> 0:34:43,880
 because,

973
0:34:43,880 --> 0:34:44,880
 it is,

974
0:34:44,880 --> 0:34:45,880
 very,

975
0:34:45,880 --> 0:34:46,880
 effective,

976
0:34:46,880 --> 0:34:47,880
 to,

977
0:34:47,880 --> 0:34:48,880
 delete,

978
0:34:48,880 --> 0:34:49,880
 content,

979
0:34:49,880 --> 0:34:50,880
 instead,

980
0:34:50,880 --> 0:34:51,880
 of,

981
0:34:51,880 --> 0:34:52,880
 blocking,

982
0:34:52,880 --> 0:34:53,880
 them.

983
0:34:53,880 --> 0:34:54,880
 Thank you.

984
0:34:54,880 --> 0:34:55,880
 Thank you.

985
0:34:55,880 --> 0:34:56,880
 It is,

986
0:34:56,880 --> 0:34:57,880
 noted.

987
0:34:57,880 --> 0:34:58,880
 So,

988
0:34:58,880 --> 0:34:59,880
 another,

989
0:34:59,880 --> 0:35:00,880
 area,

990
0:35:00,880 --> 0:35:01,880
 that,

991
0:35:01,880 --> 0:35:02,880
 we,

992
0:35:02,880 --> 0:35:03,880
 just,

993
0:35:03,880 --> 0:35:04,880
 should,

994
0:35:04,880 --> 0:35:05,880
 round,

995
0:35:05,880 --> 0:35:06,880
 here,

996
0:35:06,880 --> 0:35:07,880
 towards,

997
0:35:07,880 --> 0:35:08,880
 we have,

998
0:35:08,880 --> 0:35:09,880
 the so-called,

999
0:35:09,880 --> 0:35:10,880
 face recognition,

1000
0:35:10,880 --> 0:35:11,880
 which,

1001
0:35:11,880 --> 0:35:12,880
 among other things,

1002
0:35:12,880 --> 0:35:13,880
 you try to control,

1003
0:35:13,880 --> 0:35:14,880
 in the EU.

1004
0:35:14,880 --> 0:35:15,880
 A few years ago,

1005
0:35:15,880 --> 0:35:16,880
 there,

1006
0:35:16,880 --> 0:35:17,880
 tried,

1007
0:35:17,880 --> 0:35:18,880
 alternatives,

1008
0:35:18,880 --> 0:35:19,880
 I think it was,

1009
0:35:19,880 --> 0:35:20,880
 they tried,

1010
0:35:20,880 --> 0:35:21,880
 to get the parliament,

1011
0:35:21,880 --> 0:35:22,880
 to go,

1012
0:35:22,880 --> 0:35:23,880
 completely,

1013
0:35:23,880 --> 0:35:24,880
 against,

1014
0:35:24,880 --> 0:35:25,880
 face recognition,

1015
0:35:25,880 --> 0:35:26,880
 in the public,

1016
0:35:26,880 --> 0:35:27,880
 room.

1017
0:35:27,880 --> 0:35:28,880
 So,

1018
0:35:28,880 --> 0:35:29,880
 in general,

1019
0:35:29,880 --> 0:35:30,880
 they tried,

1020
0:35:30,880 --> 0:35:31,880
 to get a ban,

1021
0:35:31,880 --> 0:35:32,880
 against,

1022
0:35:32,880 --> 0:35:33,880
 that,

1023
0:35:33,880 --> 0:35:34,880
 it could,

1024
0:35:34,880 --> 0:35:35,880
 be used,

1025
0:35:35,880 --> 0:35:36,880
 out there.

1026
0:35:36,880 --> 0:35:37,880
 How,

1027
0:35:37,880 --> 0:35:38,880
 do,

1028
0:35:38,880 --> 0:35:39,880
 you,

1029
0:35:39,880 --> 0:35:40,880
 deal,

1030
0:35:40,880 --> 0:35:41,880
 with,

1031
0:35:41,880 --> 0:35:42,880
 this,

1032
0:35:42,880 --> 0:35:43,880
 with,

1033
0:35:43,880 --> 0:35:44,880
 that,

1034
0:35:44,880 --> 0:35:45,880
 one,

1035
0:35:45,880 --> 0:35:46,880
 can,

1036
0:35:46,880 --> 0:35:47,880
 be,

1037
0:35:47,880 --> 0:35:48,880
 recognized,

1038
0:35:48,880 --> 0:35:49,880
 and,

1039
0:35:49,880 --> 0:35:50,880
 maybe,

1040
0:35:50,880 --> 0:35:51,880
 profiled,

1041
0:35:51,880 --> 0:35:52,880
 in the,

1042
0:35:52,880 --> 0:35:53,880
 public,

1043
0:35:53,880 --> 0:35:54,880
 room?

1044
0:35:54,880 --> 0:35:55,880
 I,

1045
0:35:55,880 --> 0:35:56,880
 can,

1046
0:35:56,880 --> 0:35:57,880
 remember,

1047
0:35:57,880 --> 0:35:58,880
 that,

1048
0:35:58,880 --> 0:35:59,880
 discussion.

1049
0:35:59,880 --> 0:36:00,880
 We,

1050
0:36:00,880 --> 0:36:01,880
 have,

1051
0:36:01,880 --> 0:36:02,880
 there,

1052
0:36:02,880 --> 0:36:03,880
 is,

1053
0:36:03,880 --> 0:36:04,880
 a professor,

1054
0:36:04,880 --> 0:36:05,880
 in,

1055
0:36:05,880 --> 0:36:06,880
 the,

1056
0:36:06,880 --> 0:36:08,880
 council,

1057
0:36:08,880 --> 0:36:09,880
 of,

1058
0:36:09,880 --> 0:36:11,880
 the,

1059
0:36:11,880 --> 0:36:13,880
 public,

1060
0:36:13,880 --> 0:36:14,880
 the,

1061
0:36:14,880 --> 0:36:15,880
 public,

1062
0:36:15,880 --> 0:36:16,880
 the,

1063
0:36:16,880 --> 0:36:17,880
 of,

1064
0:36:17,880 --> 0:36:18,880
 the,

1065
0:36:18,880 --> 0:36:19,880
 public,

1066
0:36:19,880 --> 0:36:20,880
 the,

1067
0:36:20,880 --> 0:36:21,880
 of,

1068
0:36:21,880 --> 0:36:22,880
 research,

1069
0:36:22,880 --> 0:36:23,880
 of,

1070
0:36:23,880 --> 0:36:24,880
 the,

1071
0:36:24,880 --> 0:36:25,880
 of,

1072
0:36:25,880 --> 0:36:26,880
 of,

1073
0:36:26,880 --> 0:36:27,880
 the,

1074
0:36:27,880 --> 0:36:28,880
 of,

1075
0:36:28,880 --> 0:36:29,880
 the,

1076
0:36:29,880 --> 0:36:30,880
 of,

1077
0:36:30,880 --> 0:36:31,880
 of,

1078
0:36:31,880 --> 0:36:32,880
 the,

1079
0:36:32,880 --> 0:36:33,880
 the,

1080
0:36:33,880 --> 0:36:34,880
 the,

1081
0:36:34,880 --> 0:36:39,880
 It was something with the wording around it.

1082
0:36:39,880 --> 0:36:43,880
 Because the thing with the overwintering, if you think of the public space as something down the street,

1083
0:36:43,880 --> 0:36:46,880
 I would have a very, very bad feeling about it.

1084
0:36:46,880 --> 0:36:48,880
 That we just have facial recognition in some places.

1085
0:36:48,880 --> 0:36:51,880
 I can't see why we should have that.

1086
0:36:51,880 --> 0:36:59,880
 But as I understood it, the problem was that you cut off places where there could be good reasons for it.

1087
0:36:59,880 --> 0:37:05,880
 And I also heard people who worked with this say that it was simply too clumsy.

1088
0:37:05,880 --> 0:37:08,880
 So as I understood it, that was the discussion that went on at the time.

1089
0:37:08,880 --> 0:37:11,880
 Without remembering all the details.

1090
0:37:11,880 --> 0:37:13,880
 You are opposed to it, I can understand that.

1091
0:37:13,880 --> 0:37:15,880
 Excuse me, what did you say?

1092
0:37:15,880 --> 0:37:17,880
 You are opposed to it.

1093
0:37:17,880 --> 0:37:18,880
 To what?

1094
0:37:18,880 --> 0:37:20,880
 Overwintering in the public space with facial recognition.

1095
0:37:20,880 --> 0:37:21,880
 Yes.

1096
0:37:21,880 --> 0:37:27,880
 As you were saying earlier, in relation to the Nikkei Group's famous claim that overwintering is freedom,

1097
0:37:27,880 --> 0:37:29,880
 you think that it is not.

1098
0:37:29,880 --> 0:37:32,880
 But how else should we relate to this?

1099
0:37:32,880 --> 0:37:33,880
 There is a great need.

1100
0:37:33,880 --> 0:37:35,880
 People have a need for security.

1101
0:37:35,880 --> 0:37:41,880
 Should there be a little bit of overwintering or are we already far over where we should be?

1102
0:37:41,880 --> 0:37:44,880
 Well, of course there is a certain degree of overwintering.

1103
0:37:44,880 --> 0:37:50,880
 When you live in a democracy, we give some of our freedom, so to speak, in order to get some security in return.

1104
0:37:50,880 --> 0:37:52,880
 That's what the agreement is.

1105
0:37:52,880 --> 0:37:54,880
 That's what our social contract is.

1106
0:37:54,880 --> 0:37:58,880
 You can't just choose which side you want to drive on the street or where you want to drive.

1107
0:37:58,880 --> 0:37:59,880
 There are rules for that.

1108
0:37:59,880 --> 0:38:03,880
 On the other hand, you can also make sure that the others do the same.

1109
0:38:03,880 --> 0:38:05,880
 And that's the way it works.

1110
0:38:05,880 --> 0:38:07,880
 You are not completely free.

1111
0:38:07,880 --> 0:38:09,880
 We have a penalty law in Denmark, for example.

1112
0:38:09,880 --> 0:38:11,880
 You can't just do whatever you want.

1113
0:38:11,880 --> 0:38:13,880
 So some permits have to be taken into account.

1114
0:38:13,880 --> 0:38:15,880
 And therefore, of course, we use overwintering.

1115
0:38:15,880 --> 0:38:17,880
 Now I mentioned banks before.

1116
0:38:17,880 --> 0:38:20,880
 That's a place where we do it and where people can understand why we do it.

1117
0:38:20,880 --> 0:38:22,880
 Or train stations or other places.

1118
0:38:22,880 --> 0:38:28,880
 But where I think the problem arises with Nick, for example, is that you just think we should just have more cameras on.

1119
0:38:28,880 --> 0:38:29,880
 Everywhere.

1120
0:38:29,880 --> 0:38:31,880
 And then it gets even better.

1121
0:38:31,880 --> 0:38:34,880
 When we now hear people who actually know about this say, well, it just doesn't fit.

1122
0:38:34,880 --> 0:38:36,880
 That's not how we solve the problems.

1123
0:38:36,880 --> 0:38:38,880
 There are other underlying problems we need to take care of.

1124
0:38:38,880 --> 0:38:42,880
 The idea of just overwintering all citizens more.

1125
0:38:42,880 --> 0:38:44,880
 Because then we can catch someone who does something.

1126
0:38:44,880 --> 0:38:46,880
 That's simply not the way to do it.

1127
0:38:46,880 --> 0:38:50,880
 And I think I listen a lot to those who actually know something about what they're talking about.

1128
0:38:50,880 --> 0:38:53,880
 And when we can hear from them, it's not a tool they think makes sense.

1129
0:38:53,880 --> 0:38:56,880
 Well, then I don't think we should do that.

1130
0:38:56,880 --> 0:39:02,880
 Even if they say, well, if we just overwinter all our citizens completely with cameras and we overwinter their phones,

1131
0:39:02,880 --> 0:39:05,880
 then we can stop all criminal activities.

1132
0:39:05,880 --> 0:39:07,880
 Even then I would be against it.

1133
0:39:07,880 --> 0:39:10,880
 Because it's simply too far to go.

1134
0:39:10,880 --> 0:39:14,880
 We have to, as I said before, you give some of your freedom when you live in a democratic society,

1135
0:39:14,880 --> 0:39:16,880
 in order to get some rights.

1136
0:39:16,880 --> 0:39:18,880
 But you shouldn't give it all.

1137
0:39:18,880 --> 0:39:19,880
 Then it's not a democracy anymore.

1138
0:39:19,880 --> 0:39:20,880
 Then it's a different type of society.

1139
0:39:20,880 --> 0:39:22,880
 And I wouldn't want to live in that.

1140
0:39:22,880 --> 0:39:25,880
 I want to hear if there's more from the audience.

1141
0:39:26,880 --> 0:39:28,880
 Is there anything from the internet?

1142
0:39:28,880 --> 0:39:30,880
 There's a question coming in here.

1143
0:39:34,880 --> 0:39:37,880
 Hi, I'm from the USA.

1144
0:39:37,880 --> 0:39:42,880
 And I would like to ask about what we mean by security.

1145
0:39:42,880 --> 0:39:48,880
 Because it looks to me as if Denmark already has a lot of security.

1146
0:39:48,880 --> 0:39:54,880
 And if what we already have isn't enough, what is enough?

1147
0:39:56,880 --> 0:39:57,880
 That's exactly it.

1148
0:39:57,880 --> 0:40:00,880
 And I actually think that the premise of a lot of this that has been discussed earlier,

1149
0:40:00,880 --> 0:40:03,880
 not here, but in the debate,

1150
0:40:03,880 --> 0:40:07,880
 because you get the impression that it's insanely dangerous to walk down the street in Denmark,

1151
0:40:07,880 --> 0:40:11,880
 and you get shot down and overrun and shot and raped wherever you go.

1152
0:40:11,880 --> 0:40:12,880
 That's not true.

1153
0:40:12,880 --> 0:40:15,880
 We have an extremely secure society, an extremely safe society.

1154
0:40:15,880 --> 0:40:18,880
 And all statistics indicate that it's going the right way.

1155
0:40:18,880 --> 0:40:24,880
 And when it's going the right way, it's really hard for people to introduce even more overwintering.

1156
0:40:24,880 --> 0:40:25,880
 Because then we don't have a problem.

1157
0:40:25,880 --> 0:40:30,880
 And that applies in general to an incredibly large number of political areas,

1158
0:40:30,880 --> 0:40:33,880
 not just when we're talking about rape and violence and that sort of thing.

1159
0:40:33,880 --> 0:40:39,880
 We have to say, okay, is there ever a problem before we start making new laws or something else to solve it?

1160
0:40:39,880 --> 0:40:42,880
 Because if there's not a problem, then maybe we should use the time for something else.

1161
0:40:42,880 --> 0:40:44,880
 I completely agree with you.

1162
0:40:44,880 --> 0:40:49,880
 My impression is not that we live in an unfit society where there is a need for even more tools,

1163
0:40:49,880 --> 0:40:53,880
 even more surveillance, even more to the police and police services.

1164
0:40:53,880 --> 0:40:54,880
 Not at all.

1165
0:40:54,880 --> 0:40:58,880
 On the contrary, we have a secure society, and we have to take care of that.

1166
0:40:58,880 --> 0:41:03,880
 And I was a little worried when we were talking about corona laws and epidemic laws and all this earlier,

1167
0:41:03,880 --> 0:41:11,880
 that you're going to create a problem for yourself as a society by breathing into a fire and digging some holes

1168
0:41:11,880 --> 0:41:17,880
 and creating a real resistance against some of the approaches that are coming.

1169
0:41:17,880 --> 0:41:22,880
 Then you start to get an unfit society, and I think you have to be very careful about that.

1170
0:41:22,880 --> 0:41:27,880
 And I think there's a reason to introduce rules just to do it.

1171
0:41:27,880 --> 0:41:29,880
 It has to have a purpose.

1172
0:41:29,880 --> 0:41:32,880
 And here I think it's starting to become counterproductive, actually.

1173
0:41:32,880 --> 0:41:37,880
 I was speculating that you, Esther, have been here for a little over a year.

1174
0:41:37,880 --> 0:41:42,880
 We've had a big scandal here in Denmark, which is that the Defense Intelligence Service

1175
0:41:42,880 --> 0:41:46,880
 allegedly has some collaborations with the American Intelligence Service, NSA.

1176
0:41:46,880 --> 0:41:51,880
 There's always some commission work and something that needs to investigate these things.

1177
0:41:51,880 --> 0:41:59,880
 But I was just thinking, in general, how do you think we should cooperate with a country like the USA?

1178
0:41:59,880 --> 0:42:03,880
 Well, in general, yes. We cooperate with our allies.

1179
0:42:03,880 --> 0:42:07,880
 But of course it has to be done in a legal way and in a responsible way.

1180
0:42:07,880 --> 0:42:10,880
 But I don't sit in those areas anymore.

1181
0:42:10,880 --> 0:42:15,880
 I can't imagine a world where we don't cooperate with the Defense Intelligence Service of other countries.

1182
0:42:15,880 --> 0:42:17,880
 It happens all the time.

1183
0:42:17,880 --> 0:42:21,880
 But it's clear, when there's a case where you can see that it's being abused,

1184
0:42:21,880 --> 0:42:26,880
 then it creates a serious concern and criticism of the collaboration.

1185
0:42:26,880 --> 0:42:29,880
 So, when you give...

1186
0:42:29,880 --> 0:42:33,880
 I was going to quote Spider-Man...

1187
0:42:33,880 --> 0:42:36,880
 I feel it's also a big responsibility, but it does happen.

1188
0:42:36,880 --> 0:42:42,880
 And when you allow this to open up for some things, then it has to be used for what's relevant to everything else.

1189
0:42:42,880 --> 0:42:46,880
 I have the last question here, which is important to be answered.

1190
0:42:46,880 --> 0:42:50,880
 You're known as the heavy metal politician. What are your favorite orchestras?

1191
0:42:51,880 --> 0:42:53,880
 So, that's the big question.

1192
0:42:53,880 --> 0:42:56,880
 Right now I'm wearing a King Diamond T-shirt.

1193
0:42:56,880 --> 0:42:59,880
 But it's a difficult question, because it depends on the context.

1194
0:42:59,880 --> 0:43:01,880
 Who am I sitting with?

1195
0:43:01,880 --> 0:43:04,880
 But I've always been incredibly happy with the good old King Diamond.

1196
0:43:04,880 --> 0:43:07,880
 And I'm also happy to mention bands like Devin Townshend and Strap Young Mad,

1197
0:43:07,880 --> 0:43:09,880
 which I'm still incredibly happy with.

1198
0:43:09,880 --> 0:43:13,880
 I can see Nicky's recognition among the audience.

1199
0:43:13,880 --> 0:43:16,880
 I would like to say a very big thank you to Stinus Lindgren,

1200
0:43:16,880 --> 0:43:19,880
 member of the Radical Left, and IT manager from SAMA.

1201
0:43:19,880 --> 0:43:20,880
 Many thanks.

1202
0:43:21,880 --> 0:43:23,880
 Thank you.
