0:00:00,000 --> 0:00:09,200
 So, this next talk is by Greg Asbauer-Petersen,

2
0:00:09,300 --> 0:00:13,180
 who will talk about the magic of distributed objects.

3
0:00:14,760 --> 0:00:17,780
 Or as the title says, distributed objects and magic,

4
0:00:18,380 --> 0:00:19,620
 which is basically the same.

5
0:00:21,080 --> 0:00:21,680
 Hello.

6
0:00:22,880 --> 0:00:27,600
 I'm going to talk about this kind of probably slightly exotic topic,

7
0:00:27,600 --> 0:00:32,560
 because it's something which I've spent about 10 years of my life on.

8
0:00:33,340 --> 0:00:36,020
 My background is anthropology.

9
0:00:36,200 --> 0:00:37,020
 I'm an anthropologist.

10
0:00:37,380 --> 0:00:41,480
 I've done research in the world of open source software

11
0:00:41,480 --> 0:00:49,440
 and property relations and ownership models and so forth for a long time.

12
0:00:50,820 --> 0:00:55,620
 At some point, you always end up in that situation that you have a life,

13
0:00:55,620 --> 0:00:56,840
 which has to work,

14
0:00:56,980 --> 0:00:57,580
 which means you have...

15
0:00:57,600 --> 0:01:01,480
 You have to be able to pay bills and support your kids and stuff like that.

16
0:01:01,700 --> 0:01:07,100
 And that made me choose to leave academia and become a sysadmin instead of.

17
0:01:08,660 --> 0:01:11,620
 You know, salary every month, super.

18
0:01:12,980 --> 0:01:19,100
 But I still have this interest as an anthropologist

19
0:01:19,100 --> 0:01:26,600
 on the existence of magic and distributed objects.

20
0:01:26,600 --> 0:01:30,060
 And I will get into what I actually mean with this

21
0:01:30,060 --> 0:01:33,880
 and how this is actually related to free software

22
0:01:33,880 --> 0:01:35,780
 and the production of free software.

23
0:01:36,280 --> 0:01:42,560
 And in particular, the production of free software within a project known as OpenWRT.

24
0:01:44,440 --> 0:01:50,160
 I have for a number of years, I was a member of the OpenWRT core team.

25
0:01:52,280 --> 0:01:54,320
 To be honest, I'm not much of a coder.

26
0:01:55,080 --> 0:01:56,560
 I'm actually probably...

27
0:01:56,600 --> 0:02:00,800
 The best in terms of technical things, is that I'm really good at breaking stuff.

28
0:02:01,800 --> 0:02:04,640
 And it's a challenge for me to fix it again.

29
0:02:05,600 --> 0:02:06,720
 But I try.

30
0:02:08,360 --> 0:02:09,920
 So I did a lot of other things.

31
0:02:10,880 --> 0:02:17,880
 And one of the things that interested me was actually how do I understand the model of ownership

32
0:02:17,880 --> 0:02:23,600
 and the relationships around property in this context.

33
0:02:24,760 --> 0:02:26,360
 But to start that,

34
0:02:26,960 --> 0:02:29,240
 we got a couple of questions.

35
0:02:29,960 --> 0:02:31,320
 The title is distributed objects and magic.

36
0:02:31,320 --> 0:02:31,920
 And see if this changes?

37
0:02:31,920 --> 0:02:32,560
 Yes.

38
0:02:35,160 --> 0:02:38,680
 I have come up with a short definition of magic and of course of sorcery.

39
0:02:40,480 --> 0:02:41,960
 And sorcery is also important.

40
0:02:42,480 --> 0:02:46,120
 And magic is basically about enchanting people,

41
0:02:47,840 --> 0:02:51,360
 convincing them without it being obvious to them that they should do something else,

42
0:02:51,360 --> 0:02:56,480
 that they should experience certain things or they should act in specific ways.

43
0:02:56,600 --> 0:03:02,600
 Whereas sorcery is the dark art. It's about manipulation and exploitation.

44
0:03:02,600 --> 0:03:14,600
 And as an anthropologist, magic takes up a lot of space, or used to take up a lot of space, in the work, in the research.

45
0:03:14,600 --> 0:03:21,600
 Because that was what the primitive people were all about. Magic and strange ways of organizing their lives.

46
0:03:21,600 --> 0:03:25,600
 And cosmology in very strange ways.

47
0:03:25,600 --> 0:03:34,600
 And this actually led me to think that, is there still magic in our world, or is there not?

48
0:03:34,600 --> 0:03:40,600
 And how does magic find expressions today?

49
0:03:40,600 --> 0:03:46,600
 And this brought me to the concept of distributing objects,

50
0:03:46,600 --> 0:03:51,600
 which is a concept which is basically taken from an anthropological discussion

51
0:03:51,600 --> 0:03:53,600
 of art objects.

52
0:03:53,600 --> 0:03:59,600
 That you have certain objects, it could be a painting, it could be a figure,

53
0:03:59,600 --> 0:04:08,600
 it could be, as I started out with, a canoe made by a tribe in Papua New Guinea.

54
0:04:08,600 --> 0:04:12,600
 And it's not just a canoe, it's much more.

55
0:04:12,600 --> 0:04:18,600
 And these objects, when you look at them, they contain qualities and intent of people.

56
0:04:18,600 --> 0:04:20,600
 And

57
0:04:21,600 --> 0:04:31,600
 with the intention that these objects should bring on, or bring with them,

58
0:04:31,600 --> 0:04:35,600
 the power and intent of the producer or the owner.

59
0:04:35,600 --> 0:04:44,600
 And so that it should give the people who, the person who meet or engage with a certain object,

60
0:04:44,600 --> 0:04:50,600
 a certain experience, or make them act in specific ways.

61
0:04:50,600 --> 0:04:54,600
 And typically distributed objects are placed in circulation.

62
0:04:54,600 --> 0:04:56,600
 They have to be visible.

63
0:04:56,600 --> 0:05:01,600
 And the intent is to enchant people.

64
0:05:01,600 --> 0:05:04,600
 And now I'm kind of getting over to magic.

65
0:05:04,600 --> 0:05:12,600
 And it's about that these objects are intended to enchant people

66
0:05:12,600 --> 0:05:16,600
 and have them act and understand the world in a specific way.

67
0:05:16,600 --> 0:05:18,600
 To give them experiences.

68
0:05:18,600 --> 0:05:21,600
 And to inspire them.

69
0:05:21,600 --> 0:05:30,600
 And this brings me to free software and ownership.

70
0:05:30,600 --> 0:05:34,600
 Which was, as I said, the beginning of all of this.

71
0:05:34,600 --> 0:05:37,600
 And there's a basic question.

72
0:05:37,600 --> 0:05:39,600
 Why do people give away source code?

73
0:05:39,600 --> 0:05:44,600
 That was when I started my project in the early 2000s.

74
0:05:44,600 --> 0:05:46,600
 It was like the big thing.

75
0:05:46,600 --> 0:05:49,600
 And it's really difficult to understand.

76
0:05:49,600 --> 0:05:54,600
 Why are these people doing all this work and just giving it away for free?

77
0:05:54,600 --> 0:06:00,600
 Is it about, in classical anthropological terms, gift giving, reciprocity?

78
0:06:00,600 --> 0:06:05,600
 Is it about community, social relations?

79
0:06:05,600 --> 0:06:11,600
 Or is it more about an economic sense that if I give something into the big cooking pot,

80
0:06:11,600 --> 0:06:15,600
 there will be more for me because everybody else is also putting stuff in there?

81
0:06:16,600 --> 0:06:19,600
 Is it just about license requirement?

82
0:06:19,600 --> 0:06:22,600
 To be in compliance with licensing?

83
0:06:22,600 --> 0:06:24,600
 Open source licensing?

84
0:06:24,600 --> 0:06:26,600
 Or is it a mystery?

85
0:06:26,600 --> 0:06:28,600
 And there wasn't any clear-cut understanding of this.

86
0:06:28,600 --> 0:06:30,600
 Why are people doing it?

87
0:06:30,600 --> 0:06:33,600
 And I was wondering about this.

88
0:06:33,600 --> 0:06:37,600
 And then something really nice happened.

89
0:06:37,600 --> 0:06:39,600
 This one came along.

90
0:06:39,600 --> 0:06:44,600
 And somebody really fucked up at Linksys.

91
0:06:44,600 --> 0:06:49,600
 So they ended up having to be forced to release the GPL source code.

92
0:06:49,600 --> 0:06:54,600
 And that was in October 2003 that it really took off.

93
0:06:54,600 --> 0:06:59,600
 And suddenly everyone was like into, hey, let's hack this thing.

94
0:06:59,600 --> 0:07:01,600
 Let's do something about it.

95
0:07:01,600 --> 0:07:03,600
 Let's find out what we can do with it.

96
0:07:03,600 --> 0:07:07,600
 And that brought the OpenWrt project along.

97
0:07:07,600 --> 0:07:09,600
 It came out of this.

98
0:07:09,600 --> 0:07:11,600
 That suddenly there was source code available.

99
0:07:11,600 --> 0:07:13,600
 You started people starting.

100
0:07:13,600 --> 0:07:17,600
 You started taking apart and putting it back again in strange ways.

101
0:07:17,600 --> 0:07:25,600
 And the Linksys WRT54G was like the thing to do that with at that point in time.

102
0:07:25,600 --> 0:07:34,600
 And this brought me to OpenWrt as a project, as an organization, as an org.

103
0:07:34,600 --> 0:07:39,600
 And I started looking at ownership and property relations there.

104
0:07:39,600 --> 0:07:42,600
 Then, okay, they're producing something.

105
0:07:43,600 --> 0:07:47,600
 They actually make themselves.

106
0:07:47,600 --> 0:07:50,600
 Like there wasn't any OpenWrt before.

107
0:07:50,600 --> 0:07:56,600
 So they started making it by cooperating and by themselves putting code together, writing code.

108
0:07:56,600 --> 0:07:59,600
 And they do it through work and play.

109
0:07:59,600 --> 0:08:04,600
 And I was kind of like, what do they actually make?

110
0:08:04,600 --> 0:08:05,600
 Okay, they write code.

111
0:08:05,600 --> 0:08:07,600
 But what does that actually mean?

112
0:08:07,600 --> 0:08:11,600
 Because what is our world?

113
0:08:11,600 --> 0:08:14,600
 What is all of this about?

114
0:08:14,600 --> 0:08:28,600
 And what I was starting at some point, I started looking at, okay, maybe it's about that they are manifesting their ownership through the creation of a territory.

115
0:08:28,600 --> 0:08:32,600
 The project itself, the source code repository.

116
0:08:32,600 --> 0:08:37,600
 They are expressing authority, like the right to control.

117
0:08:37,600 --> 0:08:40,600
 Specifically, who has the rights to control.

118
0:08:40,600 --> 0:08:43,600
 Who has the rights to engage with this code.

119
0:08:43,600 --> 0:08:45,600
 Who has the rights to commit.

120
0:08:45,600 --> 0:08:47,600
 And so forth.

121
0:08:47,600 --> 0:08:56,600
 So that could be in a way of understanding by these notions of territory, authority, and rights, what is actually going on here.

122
0:08:56,600 --> 0:09:05,600
 And what kind of really was like the breaking point here was, I don't know if you ever saw this one.

123
0:09:05,600 --> 0:09:09,600
 It's OpenWrt.

124
0:09:10,600 --> 0:09:16,600
 The main developer, the MBM initiated the OpenWrt project.

125
0:09:16,600 --> 0:09:33,600
 And he actually revokes the right to use the OpenWrt code from one specific company, which is actually one specific person, who broke the license requirements.

126
0:09:33,600 --> 0:09:38,600
 And I was like, what the fuck?

127
0:09:38,600 --> 0:09:39,600
 This is not something that happens very often.

128
0:09:39,600 --> 0:09:49,600
 I don't know if you've ever seen anybody revoke somebody's right to use a specific piece of source code.

129
0:09:49,600 --> 0:09:55,600
 I think this is my only example of it.

130
0:09:55,600 --> 0:09:57,600
 And it was very, very public.

131
0:09:57,600 --> 0:10:07,600
 And what happened there was that this code is circulating.

132
0:10:07,600 --> 0:10:15,600
 And the developers from the OpenWrt project, they placed their code into circulation.

133
0:10:15,600 --> 0:10:17,600
 They make it freely available.

134
0:10:17,600 --> 0:10:26,600
 And they don't have any intent of creating relationships with everyone who is using this code.

135
0:10:26,600 --> 0:10:30,600
 They don't expect that everyone will bring it back to them again.

136
0:10:30,600 --> 0:10:35,600
 They kind of have an, okay, normally bits and pieces will kind of return somehow.

137
0:10:35,600 --> 0:10:49,600
 There is a sense of that you have to kind of maintain the project, which again requires that you kind of attract developers.

138
0:10:49,600 --> 0:10:59,600
 So this whole thing about circulation is both about placing your work publicly visible.

139
0:10:59,600 --> 0:11:02,600
 And by that, maintaining your territory.

140
0:11:02,600 --> 0:11:04,600
 Maintaining your authority over it.

141
0:11:05,600 --> 0:11:12,600
 By having your copyright names and comments in the source code itself.

142
0:11:12,600 --> 0:11:16,600
 And also maintaining the project.

143
0:11:16,600 --> 0:11:18,600
 Maintaining the territory.

144
0:11:18,600 --> 0:11:21,600
 By being visible.

145
0:11:21,600 --> 0:11:26,600
 But also by attracting and helping new developers make themselves.

146
0:11:26,600 --> 0:11:33,600
 And this is about property relations.

147
0:11:33,600 --> 0:11:35,600
 And pre-software is all about that.

148
0:11:35,600 --> 0:11:39,600
 Of course, very much about licensing.

149
0:11:39,600 --> 0:11:50,600
 And in that sense, with these property relations, then as an anthropologist, there are lots of primitive people out there.

150
0:11:50,600 --> 0:11:53,600
 And they are really primitive in Papua New Guinea.

151
0:11:53,600 --> 0:11:55,600
 And they are really great.

152
0:11:55,600 --> 0:12:03,600
 Because they have a different way of acting with and understanding what property and their relations are.

153
0:12:03,600 --> 0:12:04,600
 They have a sense of multiple.

154
0:12:04,600 --> 0:12:07,600
 They have a sense of multiple ownership.

155
0:12:07,600 --> 0:12:14,600
 That it's not like an individual, like in a Western country, like in a capitalist understanding of ownership.

156
0:12:14,600 --> 0:12:24,600
 It's about a group, a family, a tribe, a people who have the rights in certain ways to a given something.

157
0:12:24,600 --> 0:12:27,600
 A given object, which could be a canoe.

158
0:12:27,600 --> 0:12:28,600
 It could be a drum.

159
0:12:28,600 --> 0:12:31,600
 It could be a shell necklace.

160
0:12:31,600 --> 0:12:35,600
 But it's always something which is publicly visible.

161
0:12:35,600 --> 0:12:38,600
 And it's in circulation.

162
0:12:38,600 --> 0:12:47,600
 Like you have some very fantastic descriptions of one tribal group who built a canoe.

163
0:12:47,600 --> 0:12:53,600
 And then they sail it to another village, like hundreds of miles away.

164
0:12:53,600 --> 0:12:58,600
 And they lend the canoe to these people as a display.

165
0:12:58,600 --> 0:12:59,600
 It's not about that they get something back.

166
0:12:59,600 --> 0:13:01,600
 But they lend it.

167
0:13:01,600 --> 0:13:09,600
 And then you will see in some certain situations that this canoe is then lent onward to another tribe.

168
0:13:09,600 --> 0:13:12,600
 And then over time it might get back to the original.

169
0:13:12,600 --> 0:13:20,600
 But again, this is about display of that they had kind of the territory to create this canoe.

170
0:13:20,600 --> 0:13:26,600
 And they had their authority to do it.

171
0:13:26,600 --> 0:13:28,600
 And they have the right to lend it.

172
0:13:28,600 --> 0:13:30,600
 Lend it on.

173
0:13:30,600 --> 0:13:33,600
 Like circulate this canoe in certain ways.

174
0:13:33,600 --> 0:13:42,600
 As long as it is respected that everyone visibly knows that it belongs to a specific territory.

175
0:13:42,600 --> 0:13:45,600
 A specific group of people.

176
0:13:45,600 --> 0:13:57,600
 And in Papua New Guinea they have a very strong stories and actions around situations where people steal other people's names.

177
0:13:57,600 --> 0:14:08,600
 And stealing somebody's name would be saying, is very basically saying, this is my property.

178
0:14:08,600 --> 0:14:11,600
 This song, this canoe belongs to me.

179
0:14:11,600 --> 0:14:14,600
 That's a no-go.

180
0:14:14,600 --> 0:14:16,600
 That's a reason for going to war.

181
0:14:16,600 --> 0:14:23,600
 And they also have an expression where they talk about the use of hard words.

182
0:14:23,600 --> 0:14:25,600
 And these hard words are said.

183
0:14:25,600 --> 0:14:29,600
 This is how it is.

184
0:14:29,600 --> 0:14:38,600
 Which will typically be said, you are no longer a member of our community.

185
0:14:38,600 --> 0:14:40,600
 Our world.

186
0:14:40,600 --> 0:14:42,600
 And then you don't exist.

187
0:14:42,600 --> 0:14:44,600
 As an individual.

188
0:14:44,600 --> 0:14:51,600
 All your ties, all the entanglements that you were part of before.

189
0:14:51,600 --> 0:14:53,600
 They have been cut.

190
0:14:53,600 --> 0:14:56,600
 So that is effective.

191
0:14:56,600 --> 0:14:58,600
 That's in result.

192
0:14:58,600 --> 0:15:02,600
 It's about socially killing an individual.

193
0:15:02,600 --> 0:15:06,600
 And that brings me back to this OpenWT comment.

194
0:15:06,600 --> 0:15:09,600
 This is hard words.

195
0:15:09,600 --> 0:15:14,600
 The result was for this owner of this company, Sveasoft.

196
0:15:14,600 --> 0:15:17,600
 He went bankrupt.

197
0:15:17,600 --> 0:15:22,600
 He was held out as being an idiot.

198
0:15:22,600 --> 0:15:24,600
 An idiot.

199
0:15:24,600 --> 0:15:30,600
 An individual you could not have social relationships with.

200
0:15:30,600 --> 0:15:37,600
 Because he did not respect the ownership of others.

201
0:15:37,600 --> 0:15:46,600
 So what the OpenWT project is doing is that they are expressing their ownership through free circulation.

202
0:15:46,600 --> 0:15:49,600
 Because it is a way of showing that they have a territory.

203
0:15:49,600 --> 0:15:51,600
 They have authority.

204
0:15:51,600 --> 0:15:53,600
 And they have rights.

205
0:15:53,600 --> 0:16:01,600
 And if you want to be part of this, you have to acknowledge that this is the case.

206
0:16:01,600 --> 0:16:03,600
 You have to circulate.

207
0:16:03,600 --> 0:16:05,600
 You can do whatever with the code.

208
0:16:05,600 --> 0:16:11,600
 But you have to circulate it with the intent of the project developers.

209
0:16:11,600 --> 0:16:20,600
 So in this sense, the source code itself is a distributed object or a set of distributed objects.

210
0:16:20,600 --> 0:16:22,600
 Depending on how you look at it.

211
0:16:22,600 --> 0:16:32,600
 And this object or these objects are embedded, entangled in the intentions of the OpenWT developers.

212
0:16:32,600 --> 0:16:44,600
 And by circulating it, by keeping it visible, and by having this authority and the expression of territory,

213
0:16:44,600 --> 0:16:47,600
 they are able to reproduce ownership.

214
0:16:47,600 --> 0:16:49,600
 It's done automatically.

215
0:16:49,600 --> 0:16:59,600
 And it's done without that they have to have community ties or social relationships with the people who use the software.

216
0:16:59,600 --> 0:17:11,600
 And in that way, for me, it became an image where this is about enchanting the users and the people who meet the source code

217
0:17:11,600 --> 0:17:14,600
 into doing and following the intent of it.

218
0:17:14,600 --> 0:17:17,600
 Which is to manifest the ownership of the OpenWT project.

219
0:17:17,600 --> 0:17:20,600
 And circulating it.

220
0:17:20,600 --> 0:17:26,600
 And I think that was pretty much what I had to say.

221
0:17:26,600 --> 0:17:27,600
 Very short.

222
0:17:27,600 --> 0:17:28,600
 Maybe a little bit complex.

223
0:17:28,600 --> 0:17:30,600
 Maybe confusing.

224
0:17:30,600 --> 0:17:31,600
 Never know.

225
0:17:31,600 --> 0:17:33,600
 But what else?

226
0:17:33,600 --> 0:17:35,600
 Talk to me.

227
0:17:35,600 --> 0:17:37,600
 Any questions?

228
0:17:47,600 --> 0:17:57,600
 Okay.

229
0:17:57,600 --> 0:18:05,600
 You also gave the example of tribes or small communities who would expel people who misbehave.

230
0:18:05,600 --> 0:18:09,600
 What is different in the distributed world?

231
0:18:09,600 --> 0:18:11,600
 In...

232
0:18:11,600 --> 0:18:13,600
 Okay.

233
0:18:13,600 --> 0:18:15,600
 For me, distributed objects is simply, in this case,

234
0:18:15,600 --> 0:18:22,600
 the OpenWT has a source code repository.

235
0:18:22,600 --> 0:18:24,600
 It's freely available.

236
0:18:24,600 --> 0:18:26,600
 You can pull from it.

237
0:18:26,600 --> 0:18:32,600
 You are not able to push unless one of the developers accepts your commit.

238
0:18:32,600 --> 0:18:36,600
 And so there you have it.

239
0:18:36,600 --> 0:18:38,600
 It's distributed.

240
0:18:38,600 --> 0:18:39,600
 It's placed into circulation.

241
0:18:39,600 --> 0:18:41,600
 You can pull copies.

242
0:18:41,600 --> 0:18:44,600
 You can give these copies onwards to your friends.

243
0:18:44,600 --> 0:18:46,600
 Or whoever.

244
0:18:46,600 --> 0:18:48,600
 You can do with it what you want.

245
0:18:48,600 --> 0:18:56,600
 So you know where the territory is where you can collect the code.

246
0:18:56,600 --> 0:19:04,600
 And what you are actually then pulling from the repository is objects.

247
0:19:04,600 --> 0:19:07,600
 Do you understand that?

248
0:19:07,600 --> 0:19:13,600
 And you pull them by following, accepting the authority of the OpenWT.

249
0:19:13,600 --> 0:19:20,600
 The OpenWT developers and all the other developers who are upstream or downstream from them,

250
0:19:20,600 --> 0:19:23,600
 who have committed code into their repository,

251
0:19:23,600 --> 0:19:26,600
 by respecting that there are certain rules.

252
0:19:26,600 --> 0:19:32,600
 You cannot hide, you cannot steal the name of the OpenWT project.

253
0:19:32,600 --> 0:19:36,600
 And that's an expression of authority.

254
0:19:36,600 --> 0:19:39,600
 And then the...

255
0:19:39,600 --> 0:19:42,600
 By having this authority and by having a territory,

256
0:19:42,600 --> 0:19:46,600
 the OpenWT developers can actually give you the right to commit

257
0:19:46,600 --> 0:19:52,600
 under certain conditions.

258
0:19:52,600 --> 0:19:56,600
 And in that sense, what you then are committing,

259
0:19:56,600 --> 0:19:59,600
 you are committing objects back.

260
0:19:59,600 --> 0:20:02,600
 So you are bringing the circle back.

261
0:20:02,600 --> 0:20:05,600
 The circulation.

262
0:20:05,600 --> 0:20:09,600
 But in terms of distributed objects,

263
0:20:09,600 --> 0:20:11,600
 source code is for me just an example.

264
0:20:12,600 --> 0:20:15,600
 It can be art objects that circulate.

265
0:20:15,600 --> 0:20:19,600
 It can be, again as I said, canoes.

266
0:20:19,600 --> 0:20:22,600
 Shell necklaces.

267
0:20:22,600 --> 0:20:28,600
 And basically what is circulating and what is distributed objects in a sense,

268
0:20:28,600 --> 0:20:34,600
 is for me typically something which has to be visible.

269
0:20:34,600 --> 0:20:40,600
 If it's hidden, if it's only like traded through back channels,

270
0:20:40,600 --> 0:20:45,600
 you kind of enter into something which is more sorcery.

271
0:20:45,600 --> 0:20:50,600
 It gets, you know, dark and like something where you exploit stuff.

272
0:20:50,600 --> 0:20:55,600
 And that was actually for me one of the important aspects

273
0:20:55,600 --> 0:21:04,600
 of this announcement that the OpenWT developers withdrew the right to access.

274
0:21:04,600 --> 0:21:08,600
 Was because the owner of Sveasoft,

275
0:21:08,600 --> 0:21:12,600
 the owner of Sveasoft stole their name.

276
0:21:12,600 --> 0:21:17,600
 And that's unacceptable.

277
0:21:17,600 --> 0:21:24,600
 And in that sense, I think what is for me in this context,

278
0:21:24,600 --> 0:21:34,600
 in some ways it's difficult to directly compare art objects and source code.

279
0:21:34,600 --> 0:21:37,600
 Because they are, it's, art objects is typically,

280
0:21:37,600 --> 0:21:41,600
 in a Western context, something you buy and sell.

281
0:21:41,600 --> 0:21:47,600
 So that you actually have something which moves from a singular ownership

282
0:21:47,600 --> 0:21:54,600
 or a singular producer or manufacturer to a singular individual who owns that piece.

283
0:21:54,600 --> 0:21:59,600
 That's again a problem within the world of art, the art world,

284
0:21:59,600 --> 0:22:03,600
 because at the same time there's a lot of focus on displaying.

285
0:22:03,600 --> 0:22:06,600
 But you have individuals who buy a certain painting

286
0:22:06,600 --> 0:22:10,600
 at an auction and you never see it again.

287
0:22:10,600 --> 0:22:15,600
 Which is then, in some ways, it's problematic

288
0:22:15,600 --> 0:22:22,600
 because it's also about then stealing something of your culture.

289
0:22:22,600 --> 0:22:26,600
 Or the general culture.

290
0:22:32,600 --> 0:22:34,600
 So for me with the,

291
0:22:36,600 --> 0:22:39,600
 open source software is that,

292
0:22:39,600 --> 0:22:43,600
 if you look at it in terms of the distribution

293
0:22:43,600 --> 0:22:48,600
 that these objects are circulating as a way of manifesting ownership

294
0:22:48,600 --> 0:22:51,600
 by reproducing who made this,

295
0:22:51,600 --> 0:22:55,600
 who created this, who placed this into circulation,

296
0:22:55,600 --> 0:22:59,600
 then it, for me at least, it makes more sense

297
0:22:59,600 --> 0:23:04,600
 than looking at it as something you buy and sell and stuff like that.

298
0:23:04,600 --> 0:23:05,600
 Was that enough?

299
0:23:05,600 --> 0:23:08,600
 Over explaining?

300
0:23:08,600 --> 0:23:09,600
 Super.

301
0:23:35,600 --> 0:23:40,600
 There is sound in it,

302
0:23:40,600 --> 0:23:43,600
 but I don't know how it gets into it.

303
0:23:43,600 --> 0:23:45,600
 What?

304
0:23:45,600 --> 0:23:48,600
 Hello?

305
0:23:48,600 --> 0:23:50,600
 Okay, great.

306
0:23:50,600 --> 0:23:51,600
 So...

307
0:23:58,600 --> 0:24:02,600
 I think if you speak up I will repeat the question as good as I can.

308
0:24:05,600 --> 0:24:08,600
 I think people want to think over the music.

309
0:24:09,600 --> 0:24:14,600
 And I think that there's a different answer that

310
0:24:14,600 --> 0:24:16,600
 maybe there are two different concepts,

311
0:24:16,600 --> 0:24:19,600
 maybe there are multiple of them.

312
0:24:19,600 --> 0:24:25,600
 So, the way I thought of it is that

313
0:24:25,600 --> 0:24:30,600
 if you get a five-year development,

314
0:24:30,600 --> 0:24:33,600
 it seems to be better than what's possible.

315
0:24:33,600 --> 0:24:34,600
 So, you know,

316
0:24:34,600 --> 0:24:37,600
 So whatever the topic is,

317
0:24:37,600 --> 0:24:40,600
 you think there's a benefit if they can do the source code

318
0:24:40,600 --> 0:24:43,600
 and other developers can do the source code

319
0:24:43,600 --> 0:24:46,600
 and they'll experience it, right?

320
0:24:46,600 --> 0:24:51,600
 So if you want that to exist, you have to make it.

321
0:24:51,600 --> 0:24:55,600
 And maybe testing?

322
0:24:55,600 --> 0:24:59,600
 Okay, so there's kind of a material benefit

323
0:24:59,600 --> 0:25:03,600
 to the software being free.

324
0:25:03,600 --> 0:25:08,600
 And is that part of the magic that you're talking about

325
0:25:08,600 --> 0:25:11,600
 or is it an entirely separate social phenomenon

326
0:25:11,600 --> 0:25:16,600
 of the experience of having a territory

327
0:25:16,600 --> 0:25:19,600
 and authority within the commons?

328
0:25:26,600 --> 0:25:31,600
 I think it's...

329
0:25:31,600 --> 0:25:33,600
 Your question is about the idea

330
0:25:33,600 --> 0:25:35,600
 that free software is better than free software.

331
0:25:35,600 --> 0:25:36,600
 I think it's more about...

332
0:25:36,600 --> 0:25:38,600
 Is it more...

333
0:25:38,600 --> 0:25:41,600
 Or is it also about material properties

334
0:25:41,600 --> 0:25:45,600
 that it's maybe a better product?

335
0:25:45,600 --> 0:25:52,600
 I don't know if it always is something which is better.

336
0:25:56,600 --> 0:25:58,600
 Yeah.

337
0:25:58,600 --> 0:26:01,600
 Yeah.

338
0:26:01,600 --> 0:26:03,600
 It's not that free software is always better.

339
0:26:03,600 --> 0:26:05,600
 It's that for any given software,

340
0:26:05,600 --> 0:26:07,600
 it would be better if it were free.

341
0:26:07,600 --> 0:26:13,600
 And so there are advantages to free software.

342
0:26:13,600 --> 0:26:18,600
 And if we want it to exist, we have to make it.

343
0:26:18,600 --> 0:26:24,600
 But yeah, I mean, do you think that the way in which it's better

344
0:26:24,600 --> 0:26:26,600
 is part of the social magic that you're talking about

345
0:26:26,600 --> 0:26:29,600
 or is it a separate kind of phenomenon?

346
0:26:29,600 --> 0:26:32,600
 I think I would definitely question the thing

347
0:26:32,600 --> 0:26:35,600
 that open source software always is better.

348
0:26:35,600 --> 0:26:40,600
 There's a lot of open source software which is really good.

349
0:26:40,600 --> 0:26:42,600
 And then there's a lot of open source software

350
0:26:42,600 --> 0:26:46,600
 which from my personal point of view is really crap.

351
0:26:46,600 --> 0:26:52,600
 I think for me, it's more about that you choose

352
0:26:52,600 --> 0:26:57,600
 to make your work visible instead of hiding it.

353
0:26:57,600 --> 0:27:01,600
 And you actually create the opportunity

354
0:27:01,600 --> 0:27:07,600
 and the potential that it could engage and become a territory

355
0:27:07,600 --> 0:27:11,600
 which would include rights and authority.

356
0:27:11,600 --> 0:27:16,600
 Or you could say it would be able to come alive

357
0:27:16,600 --> 0:27:18,600
 for others than you.

358
0:27:23,600 --> 0:27:27,600
 And so I'm not saying that I'm in no way saying that you're wrong.

359
0:27:27,600 --> 0:27:30,600
 It's just I think it's different perspectives.

360
0:27:31,600 --> 0:27:34,600
 And I think if something I could be,

361
0:27:34,600 --> 0:27:37,600
 I'm a bit critical towards that free software,

362
0:27:37,600 --> 0:27:39,600
 open source software always should be better.

363
0:27:39,600 --> 0:27:47,600
 There is, it's just about that you have a,

364
0:27:47,600 --> 0:27:52,600
 specifically you have two different ownership models here.

365
0:27:52,600 --> 0:27:55,600
 You have a singular ownership model where you say

366
0:27:55,600 --> 0:28:00,600
 that this is a singular individual or a corporation which owns this.

367
0:28:00,600 --> 0:28:02,600
 And they have the right to hide it

368
0:28:02,600 --> 0:28:06,600
 and explicitly decide how you can use this code.

369
0:28:06,600 --> 0:28:08,600
 And then you have free or open source software,

370
0:28:08,600 --> 0:28:12,600
 free and open source software where anybody can use it

371
0:28:12,600 --> 0:28:14,600
 because it's freely available.

372
0:28:14,600 --> 0:28:16,600
 They can build it, they can rebuild it,

373
0:28:16,600 --> 0:28:19,600
 they can take it apart and they can audit it.

374
0:28:19,600 --> 0:28:22,600
 And they can have other people audit it.

375
0:28:22,600 --> 0:28:28,600
 And that's more of, that's more specifically,

376
0:28:28,600 --> 0:28:32,600
 a multiple ownership model.

377
0:28:32,600 --> 0:28:36,600
 There is more than one individual typically

378
0:28:36,600 --> 0:28:39,600
 who has part in a specific piece of software.

379
0:28:39,600 --> 0:28:47,600
 And the only way that you actually become aware of the existence

380
0:28:47,600 --> 0:28:50,600
 of this piece of software that somebody has written

381
0:28:50,600 --> 0:28:53,600
 is that it's made publicly available.

382
0:28:53,600 --> 0:28:55,600
 It's placed into circulation.

383
0:28:55,600 --> 0:28:57,600
 If it's not placed into circulation,

384
0:28:58,600 --> 0:29:02,600
 it actually doesn't exist.

385
0:29:02,600 --> 0:29:06,600
 And it doesn't have a life.

386
0:29:06,600 --> 0:29:09,600
 And I think that's maybe,

387
0:29:09,600 --> 0:29:11,600
 for me that's the important part,

388
0:29:11,600 --> 0:29:13,600
 that it potentially has a life.

389
0:29:13,600 --> 0:29:15,600
 It's not, you know, they're GitHub.

390
0:29:15,600 --> 0:29:17,600
 Tons of things of GitHub.

391
0:29:17,600 --> 0:29:20,600
 Billions of codes of like lines of code.

392
0:29:20,600 --> 0:29:23,600
 I don't know how much of that actually

393
0:29:23,600 --> 0:29:26,600
 is used apart from maybe one or two individuals.

394
0:29:26,600 --> 0:29:28,600
 Some of it is used a lot

395
0:29:28,600 --> 0:29:33,600
 but there's also millions and millions of lines of codes

396
0:29:33,600 --> 0:29:35,600
 who doesn't have any life.

397
0:29:35,600 --> 0:29:38,600
 And if you try to install it on anything,

398
0:29:38,600 --> 0:29:42,600
 it just breaks my experience.

399
0:29:42,600 --> 0:29:44,600
 I'm old, you know.

400
0:29:44,600 --> 0:29:50,600
 So, and there are some,

401
0:29:50,600 --> 0:29:53,600
 some commercial stuff is actually not bad.

402
0:29:53,600 --> 0:29:57,600
 Again, depending on your situation you're in.

403
0:29:58,600 --> 0:30:06,600
 But again, I would at any point in time prefer

404
0:30:06,600 --> 0:30:09,600
 something which is circulating

405
0:30:09,600 --> 0:30:12,600
 as my personal opinion.

406
0:30:18,600 --> 0:30:21,600
 I think I'm just,

407
0:30:21,600 --> 0:30:25,600
 I don't quite see what the magic is.

408
0:30:25,600 --> 0:30:27,600
 So it's like,

409
0:30:27,600 --> 0:30:29,600
 is it the creation of being alive or?

410
0:30:29,600 --> 0:30:30,600
 The magic is,

411
0:30:30,600 --> 0:30:32,600
 the essential magic is about

412
0:30:32,600 --> 0:30:34,600
 open source and free software

413
0:30:34,600 --> 0:30:37,600
 has, is circulated with the intention

414
0:30:37,600 --> 0:30:40,600
 of keeping it in circulation.

415
0:30:40,600 --> 0:30:44,600
 And with the intention that people do something with it.

416
0:30:44,600 --> 0:30:46,600
 That's magic.

417
0:30:46,600 --> 0:30:49,600
 In my understanding.

418
0:30:49,600 --> 0:30:51,600
 You are somehow,

419
0:30:51,600 --> 0:30:53,600
 you know, you stumble across this

420
0:30:53,600 --> 0:30:55,600
 whatever on GitHub and

421
0:30:55,600 --> 0:30:56,600
 then you think, oh great.

422
0:30:56,600 --> 0:30:58,600
 I'm going to check this out.

423
0:30:58,600 --> 0:31:02,600
 And then it works for you.

424
0:31:02,600 --> 0:31:04,600
 And then you tell your friends about it.

425
0:31:04,600 --> 0:31:07,600
 You know, post it on Reddit or wherever.

426
0:31:07,600 --> 0:31:11,600
 Or you write a comment for the developer

427
0:31:11,600 --> 0:31:13,600
 or you push a fix, you know,

428
0:31:13,600 --> 0:31:15,600
 of some kind of patch to it.

429
0:31:15,600 --> 0:31:18,600
 And it gets included.

430
0:31:18,600 --> 0:31:20,600
 And for me, that's actually magic

431
0:31:20,600 --> 0:31:22,600
 that you do that.

432
0:31:22,600 --> 0:31:24,600
 Because it's not, it's again,

433
0:31:24,600 --> 0:31:25,600
 my personal opinion is that,

434
0:31:25,600 --> 0:31:27,600
 or experience is,

435
0:31:27,600 --> 0:31:31,600
 it's not something you like think about a lot.

436
0:31:31,600 --> 0:31:33,600
 You know, you know what I mean?

437
0:31:33,600 --> 0:31:36,600
 Just kind of do it.

438
0:31:36,600 --> 0:31:38,600
 And when you do something,

439
0:31:38,600 --> 0:31:39,600
 okay, where do you,

440
0:31:39,600 --> 0:31:40,600
 who's telling you?

441
0:31:40,600 --> 0:31:41,600
 Nobody's telling you.

442
0:31:41,600 --> 0:31:44,600
 So maybe there's a magician there somewhere

443
0:31:44,600 --> 0:31:45,600
 who's like, you know,

444
0:31:45,600 --> 0:31:51,600
 put some special powder over this source code.

445
0:31:51,600 --> 0:31:53,600
 And I think that's for me about

446
0:31:53,600 --> 0:31:54,600
 like this kind of,

447
0:31:54,600 --> 0:31:56,600
 that we are actually living in a world

448
0:31:56,600 --> 0:31:58,600
 which contains magic.

449
0:31:58,600 --> 0:32:00,600
 It's about words, of course.

450
0:32:00,600 --> 0:32:02,600
 And, you know, enchantment.

451
0:32:02,600 --> 0:32:05,600
 And that you can suddenly be in a situation

452
0:32:05,600 --> 0:32:07,600
 where you thought, ooh, what happened there?

453
0:32:07,600 --> 0:32:10,600
 I've never seen things in that way.

454
0:32:10,600 --> 0:32:11,600
 You know?

455
0:32:11,600 --> 0:32:13,600
 And that can be a magic moment.

456
0:32:17,600 --> 0:32:19,600
 So you explained this in the beginning.

457
0:32:19,600 --> 0:32:20,600
 I came a bit late.

458
0:32:20,600 --> 0:32:23,600
 But magic, would you describe it as,

459
0:32:23,600 --> 0:32:26,600
 a magic object is an object

460
0:32:26,600 --> 0:32:28,600
 that induces behavior in people

461
0:32:28,600 --> 0:32:31,600
 by its existence and about the story,

462
0:32:31,600 --> 0:32:34,600
 the sort of human understanding of that?

463
0:32:34,600 --> 0:32:35,600
 Right.

464
0:32:35,600 --> 0:32:37,600
 And then,

465
0:32:37,600 --> 0:32:40,600
 open source license piece of code

466
0:32:40,600 --> 0:32:42,600
 is an object because it has a license

467
0:32:42,600 --> 0:32:46,600
 and it uses a specific behavior.

468
0:32:46,600 --> 0:32:49,600
 But does it also apply to any object

469
0:32:49,600 --> 0:32:52,600
 in the world outside of these examples

470
0:32:52,600 --> 0:32:54,600
 you've taken up today?

471
0:32:57,600 --> 0:33:00,600
 It can apply to any object.

472
0:33:01,600 --> 0:33:03,600
 I would say.

473
0:33:03,600 --> 0:33:07,600
 But again, I think it's something you talk about,

474
0:33:07,600 --> 0:33:10,600
 you know, in branding and marketing

475
0:33:10,600 --> 0:33:12,600
 and with like, you know, stuff you buy.

476
0:33:12,600 --> 0:33:15,600
 Why do you buy something specifically?

477
0:33:15,600 --> 0:33:17,600
 You can say, okay, this is,

478
0:33:17,600 --> 0:33:21,600
 I want to present myself in specific ways

479
0:33:21,600 --> 0:33:25,600
 by wearing North Face.

480
0:33:25,600 --> 0:33:28,600
 You know, I've climbed that North Face.

481
0:33:28,600 --> 0:33:30,600
 No.

482
0:33:30,600 --> 0:33:36,600
 But you might say, is that,

483
0:33:36,600 --> 0:33:41,600
 is that because that piece has magic

484
0:33:41,600 --> 0:33:43,600
 or is it because it's like a commercial product

485
0:33:43,600 --> 0:33:45,600
 where you have learned somewhere

486
0:33:45,600 --> 0:33:47,600
 that you have to wear that or buy that

487
0:33:47,600 --> 0:33:50,600
 or you're buying into as a consumer?

488
0:33:51,600 --> 0:33:56,600
 You're buying into a certain expression

489
0:33:56,600 --> 0:33:58,600
 or performance.

490
0:33:58,600 --> 0:34:01,600
 And so you would,

491
0:34:01,600 --> 0:34:04,600
 it's easier in that sense to,

492
0:34:04,600 --> 0:34:07,600
 to identify certain objects as being magic

493
0:34:07,600 --> 0:34:11,600
 when they're made by individuals

494
0:34:11,600 --> 0:34:17,600
 with the intent of having you to use it,

495
0:34:17,600 --> 0:34:20,600
 having you to experience things.

496
0:34:21,600 --> 0:34:24,600
 Again, as art objects

497
0:34:24,600 --> 0:34:28,600
 or as specific traditional cultural objects,

498
0:34:28,600 --> 0:34:31,600
 which are tied into specific ways

499
0:34:31,600 --> 0:34:33,600
 of understanding the world,

500
0:34:33,600 --> 0:34:37,600
 which is different from

501
0:34:37,600 --> 0:34:43,600
 commercial consumer based approach to the world.

502
0:34:43,600 --> 0:34:45,600
 Yeah.

503
0:34:45,600 --> 0:34:48,600
 Again, they're different in terms of that.

504
0:34:48,600 --> 0:34:50,600
 They express two different ownership models.

505
0:34:50,600 --> 0:34:53,600
 Or models of ownership.

506
0:34:53,600 --> 0:34:55,600
 A singular and a,

507
0:34:55,600 --> 0:34:57,600
 in a sense, a multiple or,

508
0:34:57,600 --> 0:35:03,600
 or a shared model.

509
0:35:03,600 --> 0:35:06,600
 Any more questions?

510
0:35:06,600 --> 0:35:08,600
 Well, thank you very much for the talk.

511
0:35:08,600 --> 0:35:09,600
 Pleasure.
