0:00:00,000 --> 0:00:11,360
 On stage for the first time to tell about my flamethrowers, or flame devices as I call them, flame effects.

2
0:00:12,620 --> 0:00:18,720
 And my talk is called, How to Build Your Own Flamethrower and Not Blow Up Yourself in the Process.

3
0:00:23,560 --> 0:00:27,060
 So I made up a small agenda for today's talk.

4
0:00:27,060 --> 0:00:31,860
 Of course, since we are working with gas, there's a mandatory safety talk.

5
0:00:33,500 --> 0:00:35,680
 Then an overview, how does it work?

6
0:00:36,380 --> 0:00:41,540
 A lot of people questioned it after the last couple of days, so I will show you exactly how it works.

7
0:00:42,280 --> 0:00:45,280
 What do you need to build your own flamethrower? The parts.

8
0:00:46,620 --> 0:00:50,360
 The best practices, improvements, and maybe future plans I have.

9
0:00:51,440 --> 0:00:54,320
 I show some videos I shot of the flames in effect.

10
0:00:55,120 --> 0:00:57,040
 And I can point out some interesting details.

11
0:00:57,060 --> 0:01:01,880
 And in the end, I would like to take the questions you might have.

12
0:01:04,380 --> 0:01:10,160
 So first, for all people in hackerspaces and working with fire, you all know rule zero.

13
0:01:10,900 --> 0:01:13,600
 Don't be on fire. It's very important.

14
0:01:14,680 --> 0:01:18,780
 So please keep in mind rule zero. Don't be on fire.

15
0:01:20,880 --> 0:01:24,900
 Then there is this obligatory fire triangle.

16
0:01:27,600 --> 0:01:29,600
 To make a fire, you need three things.

17
0:01:29,600 --> 0:01:33,600
 You need oxygen, that can be either in the air or in the fuel.

18
0:01:34,400 --> 0:01:36,400
 You need fuel, and you need heat.

19
0:01:36,400 --> 0:01:41,660
 And heat can be a spark, a flame, sunlight, a chemical reaction.

20
0:01:42,800 --> 0:01:45,800
 If you take one of these three away, the flame will die.

21
0:01:45,800 --> 0:01:51,800
 So in our case, keep in mind, you're working with gas, if something goes wrong, turn off the gas.

22
0:01:51,800 --> 0:01:55,800
 Then you take away this part of the safety triangle.

23
0:01:57,060 --> 0:01:59,060
 And then the flame will die.

24
0:01:59,060 --> 0:02:01,060
 You can take the oxygen out of the air.

25
0:02:01,060 --> 0:02:05,060
 You can take the heat, you can try to blow it out, but I wouldn't recommend that.

26
0:02:05,060 --> 0:02:09,060
 So take the fuel away, and the fire will die.

27
0:02:09,060 --> 0:02:15,060
 That's very important safety aspect, the fuel of the fire triangle.

28
0:02:17,060 --> 0:02:21,060
 Then some properties of propane.

29
0:02:21,060 --> 0:02:25,060
 Propane formula is C3H8.

30
0:02:25,060 --> 0:02:27,060
 Butane is C4H8.

31
0:02:27,060 --> 0:02:29,060
 H10.

32
0:02:29,060 --> 0:02:35,060
 It's colorless odourless, and people say, hey, but if I open the gas bottle, I smell it.

33
0:02:35,060 --> 0:02:39,060
 That's because there's Mccaptain added, it's ethentyl.

34
0:02:39,060 --> 0:02:44,060
 And that's a, you are very sensitive to smell that particular smell.

35
0:02:44,060 --> 0:02:50,060
 You only need between a tenth and one parts per billion, and then you can even smell it already.

36
0:02:50,060 --> 0:02:53,060
 So it's very handy to detect gas in an early stage.

37
0:02:55,060 --> 0:02:57,060
 When you burn one kilo of propane,

38
0:02:57,060 --> 0:02:59,060
 it's about two liters.

39
0:02:59,060 --> 0:03:02,060
 It's 13.9 kilowatt hours you get from it.

40
0:03:02,060 --> 0:03:05,060
 So there's a lot of energy in propane.

41
0:03:05,060 --> 0:03:07,060
 The boiling point is minus 42 degrees.

42
0:03:07,060 --> 0:03:11,060
 So that means if you open up a bottle and you draw gas from it,

43
0:03:11,060 --> 0:03:17,060
 it will immediately start to evaporate and fill up the empty space above the gas in the bottle.

44
0:03:19,060 --> 0:03:21,060
 Evaporation costs energy.

45
0:03:21,060 --> 0:03:24,060
 So after a while, you will see the bottles freeze up.

46
0:03:24,060 --> 0:03:27,060
 And I will tell you what I do to counter that effect.

47
0:03:27,060 --> 0:03:31,060
 If you have a perfect combustion of propane,

48
0:03:31,060 --> 0:03:33,060
 then you get CO2 on border.

49
0:03:33,060 --> 0:03:39,060
 That sounds, yeah, the CO2 part is bad, of course.

50
0:03:39,060 --> 0:03:41,060
 But for the rest, you think it's good.

51
0:03:41,060 --> 0:03:43,060
 But we don't live in a perfect world.

52
0:03:43,060 --> 0:03:47,060
 And you already saw the orange flames from the flamethrowers.

53
0:03:47,060 --> 0:03:51,060
 So we don't have a perfect world.

54
0:03:51,060 --> 0:03:55,060
 So what happens if you have an incomplete combustion,

55
0:03:55,060 --> 0:03:57,060
 you also get carbon.

56
0:03:57,060 --> 0:04:00,060
 So soot and carbon monoxide.

57
0:04:00,060 --> 0:04:03,060
 But the carbon you will find on the end of the flame tube,

58
0:04:03,060 --> 0:04:04,060
 it's all black.

59
0:04:04,060 --> 0:04:06,060
 If you touch it, your hands are black.

60
0:04:06,060 --> 0:04:10,060
 And the orange flame indicates that you don't have a full combustion.

61
0:04:10,060 --> 0:04:14,060
 For us, it's an advantage because if you have a full combustion,

62
0:04:14,060 --> 0:04:16,060
 then you would have a blue flame.

63
0:04:16,060 --> 0:04:21,060
 And a blue flame is less visible than an orange cloud of fire.

64
0:04:23,060 --> 0:04:24,060
 I put these in red

65
0:04:24,060 --> 0:04:27,060
 because these are the most important things about propane.

66
0:04:27,060 --> 0:04:29,060
 The relative density of propane is 1.56.

67
0:04:29,060 --> 0:04:31,060
 That means it's heavier than air.

68
0:04:31,060 --> 0:04:33,060
 That's the reason why in most countries

69
0:04:33,060 --> 0:04:36,060
 you are not allowed to store gas bottles in your basement.

70
0:04:36,060 --> 0:04:38,060
 Because it's heavier than air.

71
0:04:38,060 --> 0:04:39,060
 It fills up the room.

72
0:04:39,060 --> 0:04:41,060
 If somebody with a cigarette would go down,

73
0:04:41,060 --> 0:04:43,060
 the whole house could explode,

74
0:04:43,060 --> 0:04:45,060
 or a boat, or where you store it.

75
0:04:45,060 --> 0:04:49,060
 That's also the reason why you don't want to be on a festival

76
0:04:49,060 --> 0:04:52,060
 and just completely wrap those bottles

77
0:04:52,060 --> 0:04:53,060
 or build them into something.

78
0:04:53,060 --> 0:04:55,060
 Or build them into a cabin or whatever.

79
0:04:55,060 --> 0:04:56,060
 Keep it open.

80
0:04:56,060 --> 0:04:58,060
 If you want to shield it from people,

81
0:04:58,060 --> 0:05:00,060
 use like these mesh-type structures

82
0:05:00,060 --> 0:05:02,060
 that the wind can blow through.

83
0:05:02,060 --> 0:05:04,060
 So if there is a leak, the gas will be away.

84
0:05:04,060 --> 0:05:07,060
 And it cannot accumulate to make a big explosion.

85
0:05:07,060 --> 0:05:10,060
 So always keep in mind it's heavier than air.

86
0:05:10,060 --> 0:05:12,060
 It will float around the bottles

87
0:05:12,060 --> 0:05:14,060
 and not go up in the air.

88
0:05:14,060 --> 0:05:17,060
 Then we have two important abbreviations.

89
0:05:17,060 --> 0:05:19,060
 It's the LEL and the UAL.

90
0:05:19,060 --> 0:05:21,060
 That's the lower explosive limit

91
0:05:21,060 --> 0:05:23,060
 and the upper explosive limit.

92
0:05:23,060 --> 0:05:25,060
 Pure propane, you can light it.

93
0:05:25,060 --> 0:05:27,060
 If you have 470 degrees or higher,

94
0:05:27,060 --> 0:05:29,060
 propane will burn.

95
0:05:29,060 --> 0:05:31,060
 But it won't explode.

96
0:05:31,060 --> 0:05:34,060
 Explosion, you need 2.1% or 9.5%.

97
0:05:34,060 --> 0:05:36,060
 If you are between that,

98
0:05:36,060 --> 0:05:38,060
 you have an explosive mixture.

99
0:05:38,060 --> 0:05:40,060
 One liter of propane expands

100
0:05:40,060 --> 0:05:43,060
 to about three cubic meters of gas.

101
0:05:43,060 --> 0:05:45,060
 So to have an explosive mixture,

102
0:05:45,060 --> 0:05:47,060
 then you need 30 cubic meters

103
0:05:47,060 --> 0:05:49,060
 totally air and gas.

104
0:05:49,060 --> 0:05:51,060
 So imagine if that blows up,

105
0:05:51,060 --> 0:05:53,060
 you have like a huge fireball.

106
0:05:53,060 --> 0:05:56,060
 And that's only one liter of propane.

107
0:05:56,060 --> 0:05:58,060
 So that's the upper and lower

108
0:05:58,060 --> 0:06:00,060
 explosive limit.

109
0:06:00,060 --> 0:06:02,060
 The gas tension in a bottle

110
0:06:02,060 --> 0:06:04,060
 at room temperature is 8.3 bars.

111
0:06:04,060 --> 0:06:06,060
 This is the, yeah,

112
0:06:06,060 --> 0:06:08,060
 if you do flame effects like we do,

113
0:06:08,060 --> 0:06:10,060
 it's the most important thing

114
0:06:10,060 --> 0:06:12,060
 because you have 8.3 bars

115
0:06:12,060 --> 0:06:14,060
 which you can turn down

116
0:06:14,060 --> 0:06:16,060
 with a high pressure regulator.

117
0:06:16,060 --> 0:06:17,060
 But when you draw gas,

118
0:06:17,060 --> 0:06:19,060
 the evaporation causes energy.

119
0:06:19,060 --> 0:06:20,060
 The bottle gets cold.

120
0:06:20,060 --> 0:06:21,060
 It freezes up.

121
0:06:21,060 --> 0:06:22,060
 The temperature drops.

122
0:06:22,060 --> 0:06:25,060
 And also the pressure in your bottle will drop

123
0:06:25,060 --> 0:06:27,060
 to the point that hardly anything comes out.

124
0:06:27,060 --> 0:06:29,060
 You can see that at night when we start,

125
0:06:29,060 --> 0:06:30,060
 we have big flames.

126
0:06:30,060 --> 0:06:31,060
 And over time,

127
0:06:31,060 --> 0:06:33,060
 you will see them getting lower.

128
0:06:33,060 --> 0:06:35,060
 That's not only the gas running out.

129
0:06:35,060 --> 0:06:37,060
 It's also the bottle freezing up.

130
0:06:37,060 --> 0:06:41,060
 So we have to fight the freezing of the bottle.

131
0:06:41,060 --> 0:06:43,060
 And I come back to that later.

132
0:06:46,060 --> 0:06:48,060
 So then if you make an effect yourself,

133
0:06:48,060 --> 0:06:50,060
 safety is important.

134
0:06:50,060 --> 0:06:51,060
 In the Netherlands,

135
0:06:51,060 --> 0:06:53,060
 the fire brigade comes and they check.

136
0:06:53,060 --> 0:06:55,060
 So they ask you to flame it, to fire it.

137
0:06:55,060 --> 0:06:57,060
 They measure the distance.

138
0:06:57,060 --> 0:06:59,060
 And they said a safe distance would be

139
0:06:59,060 --> 0:07:01,060
 at least five meters, preferably more.

140
0:07:01,060 --> 0:07:03,060
 So that's the reason I always want to

141
0:07:03,060 --> 0:07:05,060
 mount them up in towers

142
0:07:05,060 --> 0:07:07,060
 six meters up, nine meters up.

143
0:07:07,060 --> 0:07:10,060
 That makes them visible over the whole terrain

144
0:07:10,060 --> 0:07:13,060
 and immediately fills in that requirement

145
0:07:13,060 --> 0:07:14,060
 by the fire brigade

146
0:07:14,060 --> 0:07:16,060
 to have them at least five meters away

147
0:07:16,060 --> 0:07:18,060
 so people can stand next to your tower

148
0:07:18,060 --> 0:07:20,060
 and still be in the safe area.

149
0:07:21,060 --> 0:07:24,060
 But more is better.

150
0:07:24,060 --> 0:07:26,060
 Always try to mount on something metal.

151
0:07:26,060 --> 0:07:27,060
 They are on the container.

152
0:07:27,060 --> 0:07:30,060
 The container won't combust or bust in flames.

153
0:07:30,060 --> 0:07:32,060
 It's a metal.

154
0:07:32,060 --> 0:07:34,060
 You can do truss as well.

155
0:07:34,060 --> 0:07:36,060
 You can make clamps.

156
0:07:36,060 --> 0:07:39,060
 So make them solid

157
0:07:39,060 --> 0:07:42,060
 and make sure they can tip over or fall over.

158
0:07:42,060 --> 0:07:44,060
 In my future projects, I will make a sensor.

159
0:07:44,060 --> 0:07:46,060
 If it does tip, it doesn't fire.

160
0:07:46,060 --> 0:07:54,060
 So now we have the safety stuff.

161
0:07:54,060 --> 0:07:56,060
 So now it's time to go.

162
0:07:56,060 --> 0:07:59,060
 What if something does go wrong?

163
0:07:59,060 --> 0:08:01,060
 Of course, you can build something yourself

164
0:08:01,060 --> 0:08:04,060
 in your backyard or maybe at your hackerspace.

165
0:08:04,060 --> 0:08:07,060
 You try it and something is not working as you planned.

166
0:08:07,060 --> 0:08:11,060
 The pilot flame is way higher than you expected.

167
0:08:11,060 --> 0:08:13,060
 It can go sideways.

168
0:08:13,060 --> 0:08:15,060
 You're like, okay, that's not good.

169
0:08:15,060 --> 0:08:18,060
 Maybe your valve will turn or whatever.

170
0:08:18,060 --> 0:08:20,060
 So always stay calm.

171
0:08:20,060 --> 0:08:22,060
 It's propane.

172
0:08:22,060 --> 0:08:23,060
 It's burning.

173
0:08:23,060 --> 0:08:25,060
 If you start to panic,

174
0:08:25,060 --> 0:08:27,060
 nasty stuff can happen.

175
0:08:27,060 --> 0:08:29,060
 So just remain calm.

176
0:08:29,060 --> 0:08:31,060
 Shut down the gas.

177
0:08:31,060 --> 0:08:34,060
 I mean, you take away the fuel in the fire triangle.

178
0:08:34,060 --> 0:08:36,060
 So you take away the fire

179
0:08:36,060 --> 0:08:38,060
 and it will slowly go out.

180
0:08:38,060 --> 0:08:42,060
 If you can and you have a filled storage buffer,

181
0:08:42,060 --> 0:08:43,060
 you can fire it.

182
0:08:43,060 --> 0:08:45,060
 If you see it's safe to go,

183
0:08:45,060 --> 0:08:47,060
 just let all the gas go.

184
0:08:47,060 --> 0:08:49,060
 And then immediately, of course,

185
0:08:49,060 --> 0:08:51,060
 most of the gas is gone

186
0:08:51,060 --> 0:08:53,060
 and then it will even go out faster.

187
0:08:53,060 --> 0:08:55,060
 But only do that if it's possible.

188
0:08:55,060 --> 0:08:57,060
 Else, just let it burn slowly.

189
0:08:57,060 --> 0:08:59,060
 If you mount it on something metal

190
0:08:59,060 --> 0:09:01,060
 or stay away from it,

191
0:09:01,060 --> 0:09:04,060
 it can slowly die, the flame.

192
0:09:04,060 --> 0:09:05,060
 And remember rule zero.

193
0:09:05,060 --> 0:09:07,060
 Don't go there and try to do stuff

194
0:09:07,060 --> 0:09:08,060
 when it's burning.

195
0:09:08,060 --> 0:09:10,060
 Don't put yourself in danger.

196
0:09:10,060 --> 0:09:12,060
 Stay at a safe distance.

197
0:09:12,060 --> 0:09:14,060
 And then on the camp,

198
0:09:14,060 --> 0:09:16,060
 if you see me running,

199
0:09:16,060 --> 0:09:17,060
 try to keep up.

200
0:09:20,060 --> 0:09:21,060
 So that was the safety stuff.

201
0:09:21,060 --> 0:09:22,060
 That is very important.

202
0:09:22,060 --> 0:09:25,060
 And I hope you all use that

203
0:09:25,060 --> 0:09:26,060
 and use this knowledge

204
0:09:26,060 --> 0:09:28,060
 to build your own effects.

205
0:09:28,060 --> 0:09:30,060
 So now, of course,

206
0:09:30,060 --> 0:09:31,060
 people want to know,

207
0:09:31,060 --> 0:09:32,060
 how does it work?

208
0:09:32,060 --> 0:09:35,060
 Well, this is the flamethrower

209
0:09:35,060 --> 0:09:36,060
 or the flame effect

210
0:09:36,060 --> 0:09:38,060
 that is on the left-hand side.

211
0:09:38,060 --> 0:09:40,060
 I keep using the words

212
0:09:40,060 --> 0:09:42,060
 flamethrower and flame effect.

213
0:09:42,060 --> 0:09:44,060
 I try to avoid the word flame

214
0:09:44,060 --> 0:09:46,060
 because, A,

215
0:09:46,060 --> 0:09:48,060
 when you contact a hacker camp

216
0:09:48,060 --> 0:09:50,060
 or a hacker festival,

217
0:09:50,060 --> 0:09:51,060
 and you say,

218
0:09:51,060 --> 0:09:52,060
 hey, I'm bringing a flamethrower,

219
0:09:52,060 --> 0:09:53,060
 people think you bring

220
0:09:53,060 --> 0:09:54,060
 a portable device

221
0:09:54,060 --> 0:09:56,060
 that sprays liquid flames

222
0:09:56,060 --> 0:09:57,060
 in a tent-y environment

223
0:09:57,060 --> 0:09:58,060
 with lots of tents and stuff,

224
0:09:58,060 --> 0:09:59,060
 which is flammable.

225
0:09:59,060 --> 0:10:00,060
 It's not a good idea,

226
0:10:00,060 --> 0:10:02,060
 so it will scare them away.

227
0:10:02,060 --> 0:10:03,060
 But more importantly,

228
0:10:03,060 --> 0:10:05,060
 I found out in practice

229
0:10:05,060 --> 0:10:07,060
 that if you travel across Europe

230
0:10:07,060 --> 0:10:09,060
 and Border Patrol asks

231
0:10:09,060 --> 0:10:10,060
 what you are bringing,

232
0:10:10,060 --> 0:10:11,060
 and you say,

233
0:10:11,060 --> 0:10:12,060
 oh, I bring lasers and flamethrowers,

234
0:10:12,060 --> 0:10:14,060
 you can immediately empty your whole car,

235
0:10:14,060 --> 0:10:16,060
 and if you just say,

236
0:10:16,060 --> 0:10:17,060
 I bring stage effects

237
0:10:17,060 --> 0:10:19,060
 and flame effects,

238
0:10:19,060 --> 0:10:21,060
 or you say just stage effects

239
0:10:21,060 --> 0:10:22,060
 and lasers,

240
0:10:22,060 --> 0:10:23,060
 they're like,

241
0:10:23,060 --> 0:10:24,060
 oh, this is a laser guy or something,

242
0:10:24,060 --> 0:10:25,060
 and then you can go on

243
0:10:25,060 --> 0:10:27,060
 and just continue your trip,

244
0:10:27,060 --> 0:10:28,060
 and else it takes you an hour

245
0:10:28,060 --> 0:10:29,060
 to unpack and pack

246
0:10:29,060 --> 0:10:31,060
 and explain every little detail

247
0:10:31,060 --> 0:10:33,060
 to the Border Patrol.

248
0:10:33,060 --> 0:10:35,060
 So try to avoid the word flamethrower.

249
0:10:35,060 --> 0:10:37,060
 I rather use flame effect.

250
0:10:37,060 --> 0:10:40,060
 So then, how does it work?

251
0:10:40,060 --> 0:10:42,060
 We have the high-pressure gas.

252
0:10:42,060 --> 0:10:44,060
 In the bottle, it's eight bars.

253
0:10:44,060 --> 0:10:48,060
 So we bring it down,

254
0:10:48,060 --> 0:10:49,060
 the eight bars,

255
0:10:49,060 --> 0:10:51,060
 we bring it down

256
0:10:51,060 --> 0:10:53,060
 to something more,

257
0:10:53,060 --> 0:10:55,060
 yeah, handleable,

258
0:10:55,060 --> 0:10:58,060
 like in between 1.5, 3 bars, 4 bars.

259
0:10:58,060 --> 0:11:01,060
 The regulators you can use for that

260
0:11:01,060 --> 0:11:03,060
 is the ones, for instance,

261
0:11:03,060 --> 0:11:05,060
 you can use for the wheat burners.

262
0:11:05,060 --> 0:11:06,060
 You have those wheat burners

263
0:11:06,060 --> 0:11:08,060
 to burn the wheat in your garden.

264
0:11:08,060 --> 0:11:11,060
 They have a high volume

265
0:11:11,060 --> 0:11:14,060
 or high-capacity regulator.

266
0:11:14,060 --> 0:11:16,060
 The barbecue regulator,

267
0:11:16,060 --> 0:11:17,060
 we'll come to that later,

268
0:11:17,060 --> 0:11:18,060
 that's not enough.

269
0:11:18,060 --> 0:11:20,060
 That's only 30 millibars,

270
0:11:20,060 --> 0:11:24,060
 and we want 3,000 millibars.

271
0:11:24,060 --> 0:11:26,060
 So we need more.

272
0:11:26,060 --> 0:11:28,060
 So don't use a barbecue regulator

273
0:11:28,060 --> 0:11:30,060
 because it will take ages,

274
0:11:30,060 --> 0:11:32,060
 and then the pressure in the bottle

275
0:11:32,060 --> 0:11:33,060
 will be low.

276
0:11:33,060 --> 0:11:36,060
 So you need a high-pressure regulator.

277
0:11:36,060 --> 0:11:37,060
 As you can see,

278
0:11:37,060 --> 0:11:39,060
 we go through the barbecue regulator,

279
0:11:39,060 --> 0:11:43,060
 which is there to feed the pilot flame.

280
0:11:43,060 --> 0:11:46,060
 So it will go up in low pressure,

281
0:11:46,060 --> 0:11:47,060
 indicated in blue,

282
0:11:47,060 --> 0:11:49,060
 it will go up.

283
0:11:49,060 --> 0:11:50,060
 It's a copper tube,

284
0:11:50,060 --> 0:11:52,060
 and there's holes in it,

285
0:11:52,060 --> 0:11:55,060
 and around it is steel wool.

286
0:11:55,060 --> 0:11:57,060
 So the stuff you put in your pants

287
0:11:57,060 --> 0:11:58,060
 to clean your pants,

288
0:11:58,060 --> 0:11:59,060
 to scrub them,

289
0:11:59,060 --> 0:12:01,060
 that's there to avoid

290
0:12:01,060 --> 0:12:04,060
 the flame being blown out by the wind

291
0:12:04,060 --> 0:12:07,060
 and also blown out by the gas.

292
0:12:07,060 --> 0:12:09,060
 As you learned,

293
0:12:09,060 --> 0:12:11,060
 pure propane isn't explosive.

294
0:12:11,060 --> 0:12:12,060
 You can light it,

295
0:12:12,060 --> 0:12:14,060
 but it's not explosive.

296
0:12:14,060 --> 0:12:16,060
 So if it comes out of the bottle,

297
0:12:16,060 --> 0:12:17,060
 it's pure,

298
0:12:17,060 --> 0:12:19,060
 and the pressure is free bars,

299
0:12:19,060 --> 0:12:21,060
 so it can blow out the pilot flame.

300
0:12:21,060 --> 0:12:23,060
 So what you want is to have steel wool in the top

301
0:12:23,060 --> 0:12:25,060
 that will trap a bit of the gas

302
0:12:25,060 --> 0:12:27,060
 and burn slowly.

303
0:12:27,060 --> 0:12:29,060
 So if you blow a lot of propane through it,

304
0:12:29,060 --> 0:12:34,060
 there's always some residual gas in there,

305
0:12:34,060 --> 0:12:36,060
 so your flame will come up.

306
0:12:36,060 --> 0:12:38,060
 You can see it very well on the middle one

307
0:12:38,060 --> 0:12:39,060
 we have at Bornack.

308
0:12:39,060 --> 0:12:40,060
 If you fire it,

309
0:12:40,060 --> 0:12:41,060
 you'll see it goes down,

310
0:12:41,060 --> 0:12:43,060
 and it goes back up again.

311
0:12:43,060 --> 0:12:45,060
 So that's the gas that's inside the steel wool

312
0:12:45,060 --> 0:12:47,060
 that keeps the flame burning.

313
0:12:50,060 --> 0:12:51,060
 So this is your pilot flame.

314
0:12:51,060 --> 0:12:53,060
 It's roughly about 50 centimeters.

315
0:12:53,060 --> 0:12:56,060
 There's people that make this recalible.

316
0:12:56,060 --> 0:12:59,060
 They put a small reculator or a tap in between,

317
0:12:59,060 --> 0:13:00,060
 and you can even turn it down.

318
0:13:00,060 --> 0:13:02,060
 So if you don't want a big flame,

319
0:13:02,060 --> 0:13:04,060
 because if you leave it running,

320
0:13:04,060 --> 0:13:05,060
 it looks really nice,

321
0:13:05,060 --> 0:13:08,060
 but it also can already freeze up the bottle,

322
0:13:08,060 --> 0:13:10,060
 and you need that pressure for when you shoot it.

323
0:13:10,060 --> 0:13:12,060
 So you can turn it down a little.

324
0:13:12,060 --> 0:13:14,060
 So if you can find a rec,

325
0:13:14,060 --> 0:13:17,060
 one that is being able to be adjusted,

326
0:13:17,060 --> 0:13:18,060
 that's even better.

327
0:13:20,060 --> 0:13:22,060
 So then the high-pressure gas also goes straight on

328
0:13:22,060 --> 0:13:24,060
 to the T-split,

329
0:13:24,060 --> 0:13:26,060
 and it will fill the storage buffer,

330
0:13:26,060 --> 0:13:28,060
 which is, in my case,

331
0:13:28,060 --> 0:13:30,060
 an old fire extinguisher.

332
0:13:30,060 --> 0:13:33,060
 The only remark I got from the Dutch fire brigade is,

333
0:13:33,060 --> 0:13:35,060
 you can paint it black

334
0:13:35,060 --> 0:13:37,060
 because it might confuse people.

335
0:13:37,060 --> 0:13:39,060
 They think it's a fire extinguishing device,

336
0:13:39,060 --> 0:13:41,060
 but it's the opposite.

337
0:13:41,060 --> 0:13:42,060
 So if you make it black,

338
0:13:42,060 --> 0:13:45,060
 it won't confuse people.

339
0:13:45,060 --> 0:13:47,060
 I use the large ones.

340
0:13:47,060 --> 0:13:51,060
 It's the six-kilogram CO2 bottle.

341
0:13:51,060 --> 0:13:53,060
 But as a test, I did a small one here

342
0:13:53,060 --> 0:13:55,060
 in the middle and bone heck,

343
0:13:55,060 --> 0:13:57,060
 and that one actually works quite good.

344
0:13:57,060 --> 0:13:59,060
 And the advantage is it fills faster,

345
0:13:59,060 --> 0:14:02,060
 so you can do .

346
0:14:02,060 --> 0:14:04,060
 You can play songs with it.

347
0:14:04,060 --> 0:14:06,060
 So it's really cool.

348
0:14:06,060 --> 0:14:07,060
 But then you need a valve

349
0:14:07,060 --> 0:14:08,060
 that holds in the gas

350
0:14:08,060 --> 0:14:11,060
 until the moment it's there to fire it.

351
0:14:11,060 --> 0:14:14,060
 I use the two 30-volts

352
0:14:14,060 --> 0:14:17,060
 because I think they are a little faster

353
0:14:17,060 --> 0:14:19,060
 than the 12- and 24-volts,

354
0:14:19,060 --> 0:14:22,060
 but basically it's a coil that opens the valve.

355
0:14:22,060 --> 0:14:25,060
 And for me it's easier as I use a switchback,

356
0:14:25,060 --> 0:14:28,060
 which is a DMX-controlled box

357
0:14:28,060 --> 0:14:30,060
 with four outlets.

358
0:14:30,060 --> 0:14:31,060
 I just put the plugs in,

359
0:14:31,060 --> 0:14:33,060
 and then I can send the DMX signal

360
0:14:33,060 --> 0:14:35,060
 to open the valve.

361
0:14:35,060 --> 0:14:36,060
 So that's easy for me.

362
0:14:36,060 --> 0:14:37,060
 But you can, of course,

363
0:14:37,060 --> 0:14:40,060
 use Arduinos with relay boards

364
0:14:40,060 --> 0:14:43,060
 and use 12- and 24-volts.

365
0:14:43,060 --> 0:14:44,060
 If you want to go really fast,

366
0:14:44,060 --> 0:14:46,060
 that's my future projects,

367
0:14:46,060 --> 0:14:50,060
 then you can use an air-assisted valve.

368
0:14:50,060 --> 0:14:54,060
 The air-assisted valve requires a compressor,

369
0:14:54,060 --> 0:14:56,060
 which will power the valve,

370
0:14:56,060 --> 0:14:58,060
 and at the moment you switch it open,

371
0:14:58,060 --> 0:15:01,060
 it not only uses the magnetic power

372
0:15:01,060 --> 0:15:02,060
 to open up the valve,

373
0:15:02,060 --> 0:15:04,060
 but it also uses the compressed air,

374
0:15:04,060 --> 0:15:06,060
 so it will really go very fast.

375
0:15:06,060 --> 0:15:07,060
 It will open.

376
0:15:07,060 --> 0:15:09,060
 And that's a requirement you need

377
0:15:09,060 --> 0:15:12,060
 for larger diameter valves.

378
0:15:16,060 --> 0:15:18,060
 And then when you open the valve,

379
0:15:18,060 --> 0:15:21,060
 the high-pressure gas shoots out through a flame.

380
0:15:21,060 --> 0:15:22,060
 As we learned,

381
0:15:22,060 --> 0:15:24,060
 470 degrees is enough to light it.

382
0:15:24,060 --> 0:15:26,060
 The propane is still pure

383
0:15:26,060 --> 0:15:29,060
 when it comes out of the tube.

384
0:15:29,060 --> 0:15:30,060
 So in the movies,

385
0:15:30,060 --> 0:15:31,060
 I'll show you later on,

386
0:15:31,060 --> 0:15:32,060
 you will see sometimes

387
0:15:32,060 --> 0:15:34,060
 that it doesn't burn for the first 50 centimeters

388
0:15:34,060 --> 0:15:36,060
 because it's pure propane.

389
0:15:36,060 --> 0:15:37,060
 The air is getting mixed in,

390
0:15:37,060 --> 0:15:39,060
 and then it shoots up in the flame.

391
0:15:39,060 --> 0:15:40,060
 And you will see also

392
0:15:40,060 --> 0:15:42,060
 that the flame sometimes climbs.

393
0:15:42,060 --> 0:15:45,060
 So first the propane shoots up and evaporates,

394
0:15:45,060 --> 0:15:46,060
 makes a combustible mixture,

395
0:15:46,060 --> 0:15:48,060
 and then the flame follows.

396
0:15:48,060 --> 0:15:50,060
 So it climbs up the flame.

397
0:15:54,060 --> 0:15:56,060
 So now about the parts I use.

398
0:15:56,060 --> 0:15:59,060
 It's all very easy parts.

399
0:15:59,060 --> 0:16:03,060
 You can find them anywhere.

400
0:16:03,060 --> 0:16:05,060
 First you need a...

401
0:16:06,060 --> 0:16:07,060
 like a vessel,

402
0:16:07,060 --> 0:16:08,060
 a fat,

403
0:16:08,060 --> 0:16:11,060
 a barrel to hold in the gas.

404
0:16:11,060 --> 0:16:13,060
 So it needs to be gas-tight.

405
0:16:13,060 --> 0:16:15,060
 I use the fire extinguisher

406
0:16:15,060 --> 0:16:16,060
 because these,

407
0:16:16,060 --> 0:16:17,060
 when they are pressurized,

408
0:16:17,060 --> 0:16:19,060
 there are between 40 and 60 bars of CO2 in there.

409
0:16:19,060 --> 0:16:22,060
 But it means their rating is like 200 bars.

410
0:16:22,060 --> 0:16:24,060
 And we are only using two free bars.

411
0:16:24,060 --> 0:16:26,060
 So you know you're on the safe side.

412
0:16:26,060 --> 0:16:27,060
 You have something that's cheap,

413
0:16:27,060 --> 0:16:29,060
 people often throw them away,

414
0:16:29,060 --> 0:16:30,060
 or you can get them from companies

415
0:16:30,060 --> 0:16:33,060
 when they are not being used anymore

416
0:16:33,060 --> 0:16:35,060
 or not within the specified date.

417
0:16:36,060 --> 0:16:37,060
 And for us it's good.

418
0:16:37,060 --> 0:16:39,060
 I also have diving cylinders,

419
0:16:39,060 --> 0:16:42,060
 all diving cylinders of the German fire department,

420
0:16:42,060 --> 0:16:44,060
 which they use for compressed air.

421
0:16:44,060 --> 0:16:47,060
 Also ones for rescue from the fire brigade

422
0:16:47,060 --> 0:16:49,060
 to have oxygen when they go into fires

423
0:16:49,060 --> 0:16:50,060
 with the oxygen mask.

424
0:16:50,060 --> 0:16:55,060
 These also run out of a certain certification date.

425
0:16:55,060 --> 0:16:58,060
 So these bottles are all very well to use

426
0:16:58,060 --> 0:17:01,060
 and they all have a nice thread in the top.

427
0:17:01,060 --> 0:17:03,060
 This one is three quarters of an inch.

428
0:17:03,060 --> 0:17:06,060
 So you can use standard piping like this.

429
0:17:06,060 --> 0:17:11,060
 So these are just very cheap pipes,

430
0:17:11,060 --> 0:17:14,060
 which you can just buy with the tool station

431
0:17:14,060 --> 0:17:16,060
 or your do-it-yourself shop.

432
0:17:16,060 --> 0:17:19,060
 It's three quarters of an inch and they turn,

433
0:17:19,060 --> 0:17:21,060
 you can screw them into this bottle.

434
0:17:21,060 --> 0:17:24,060
 It's all parts like this tube is,

435
0:17:24,060 --> 0:17:26,060
 I think, two euros or something.

436
0:17:26,060 --> 0:17:28,060
 And the T-split is like three euros.

437
0:17:28,060 --> 0:17:30,060
 So you can use very cheap parts.

438
0:17:30,060 --> 0:17:32,060
 I think the whole thing can be built

439
0:17:32,060 --> 0:17:34,060
 for under 100 euros, easy.

440
0:17:36,060 --> 0:17:39,060
 You need a magnetic valve.

441
0:17:39,060 --> 0:17:43,060
 Most ones are capable of doing one megapascal,

442
0:17:43,060 --> 0:17:44,060
 which is 10 bars.

443
0:17:44,060 --> 0:17:47,060
 Sometimes you can even go up to 16 bars.

444
0:17:47,060 --> 0:17:50,060
 Well, we're using two to three bars,

445
0:17:50,060 --> 0:17:53,060
 maybe sometimes four if you really want a big flame.

446
0:17:53,060 --> 0:17:55,060
 If you go higher, you will probably see,

447
0:17:55,060 --> 0:17:56,060
 even with the steel wool,

448
0:17:56,060 --> 0:17:58,060
 you will blow out the pilot flame.

449
0:17:58,060 --> 0:18:00,060
 So you can buy a six bar regulator,

450
0:18:00,060 --> 0:18:02,060
 turn it all the way up.

451
0:18:02,060 --> 0:18:03,060
 It might work

452
0:18:03,060 --> 0:18:06,060
 or you might make the pilot flame bigger.

453
0:18:06,060 --> 0:18:07,060
 Or more turns,

454
0:18:07,060 --> 0:18:10,060
 but you will see at above four or five bars,

455
0:18:10,060 --> 0:18:11,060
 you will blow it out anyway

456
0:18:11,060 --> 0:18:14,060
 because there's so much propane coming through

457
0:18:14,060 --> 0:18:16,060
 and it's still not combustible at the moment.

458
0:18:16,060 --> 0:18:17,060
 So it will just douse the flame.

459
0:18:17,060 --> 0:18:20,060
 So basically you make some sort of fire extinguisher

460
0:18:20,060 --> 0:18:23,060
 from the fire extinguisher with gas.

461
0:18:23,060 --> 0:18:26,060
 So yeah, you have to have a valve

462
0:18:26,060 --> 0:18:28,060
 that can switch to 10 bars.

463
0:18:28,060 --> 0:18:30,060
 And the seals are very important.

464
0:18:30,060 --> 0:18:32,060
 You have phyton seals, NBR,

465
0:18:32,060 --> 0:18:35,060
 which is something called nitrile butane rubber.

466
0:18:35,060 --> 0:18:40,060
 Different seals are there for different gases or liquids.

467
0:18:40,060 --> 0:18:44,060
 So some valves are very good in switching water.

468
0:18:44,060 --> 0:18:46,060
 Others are better for switching gas.

469
0:18:46,060 --> 0:18:49,060
 So do some research to which seals you use.

470
0:18:49,060 --> 0:18:51,060
 I have a mix of phyton and NBR.

471
0:18:51,060 --> 0:18:53,060
 And for gas, they work.

472
0:18:53,060 --> 0:18:55,060
 But if you want to do other stuff,

473
0:18:55,060 --> 0:18:57,060
 you have to check the valves.

474
0:18:57,060 --> 0:19:00,060
 And some valves are not suitable for gas.

475
0:19:00,060 --> 0:19:02,060
 So don't use those.

476
0:19:02,060 --> 0:19:06,060
 I already talked about the high-pressure regulator,

477
0:19:06,060 --> 0:19:08,060
 the wheat burner or just a regulator.

478
0:19:08,060 --> 0:19:12,060
 Here in Denmark, I saw they have the clip-on stuff.

479
0:19:12,060 --> 0:19:15,060
 A lot of them have the barbecue regulator built in.

480
0:19:15,060 --> 0:19:17,060
 You don't want that one.

481
0:19:17,060 --> 0:19:19,060
 And a lot of them are 0 to 2 bars.

482
0:19:19,060 --> 0:19:20,060
 You can still fire.

483
0:19:20,060 --> 0:19:22,060
 Yesterday we fired with 2 bars.

484
0:19:22,060 --> 0:19:23,060
 It looked good.

485
0:19:23,060 --> 0:19:25,060
 But if you really want to refill faster,

486
0:19:25,060 --> 0:19:27,060
 you need more pressure.

487
0:19:27,060 --> 0:19:30,060
 So the pressure makes more pressure in the barrel.

488
0:19:30,060 --> 0:19:31,060
 It makes sometimes the flame go higher.

489
0:19:31,060 --> 0:19:35,060
 But it also makes the bottle recharge faster.

490
0:19:35,060 --> 0:19:37,060
 So you can fire faster.

491
0:19:37,060 --> 0:19:40,060
 Now you see it takes 5 seconds to charge.

492
0:19:40,060 --> 0:19:42,060
 Also because the line is 25 meters.

493
0:19:42,060 --> 0:19:44,060
 Because I need this for another project.

494
0:19:44,060 --> 0:19:46,060
 So if you keep the line short,

495
0:19:46,060 --> 0:19:50,060
 you will be able to recharge your bottle faster.

496
0:19:50,060 --> 0:19:52,060
 So with a 5 meter and a 2 bar,

497
0:19:52,060 --> 0:19:55,060
 you will probably be able to fill it in 2 seconds.

498
0:19:55,060 --> 0:19:59,060
 The barbecue regulator, I already talked about it.

499
0:19:59,060 --> 0:20:01,060
 In the Netherlands, it's 30 million.

500
0:20:01,060 --> 0:20:04,060
 In some countries, it's 50 millibars.

501
0:20:04,060 --> 0:20:06,060
 If you take the 50 millibars,

502
0:20:06,060 --> 0:20:08,060
 you will notice that your bottle will freeze up faster.

503
0:20:08,060 --> 0:20:10,060
 Even if you just let it run for an hour,

504
0:20:10,060 --> 0:20:12,060
 the bottle will freeze up.

505
0:20:12,060 --> 0:20:14,060
 So the lower, if you can find the 19,

506
0:20:14,060 --> 0:20:17,060
 because some countries also have 29 or lower,

507
0:20:17,060 --> 0:20:18,060
 or the adjustable one,

508
0:20:18,060 --> 0:20:20,060
 it will save your bottle from freezing up.

509
0:20:20,060 --> 0:20:23,060
 Because sometimes on an effect, they want just the flame.

510
0:20:23,060 --> 0:20:25,060
 And then at some point, they want to fire it.

511
0:20:25,060 --> 0:20:27,060
 But they already want it light,

512
0:20:27,060 --> 0:20:29,060
 because you can make a whole path of fire

513
0:20:29,060 --> 0:20:30,060
 that people can come into.

514
0:20:30,060 --> 0:20:32,060
 For instance, the entrance of a festival.

515
0:20:32,060 --> 0:20:34,060
 So it looks really nice.

516
0:20:34,060 --> 0:20:35,060
 But if they are burning,

517
0:20:35,060 --> 0:20:36,060
 then your bottles are frozen.

518
0:20:36,060 --> 0:20:37,060
 And the first time you shoot them,

519
0:20:37,060 --> 0:20:39,060
 there's only one 2 meter flame,

520
0:20:39,060 --> 0:20:41,060
 because the pressure has dropped.

521
0:20:41,060 --> 0:20:43,060
 So the lower you can get this,

522
0:20:43,060 --> 0:20:45,060
 the better it is.

523
0:20:45,060 --> 0:20:47,060
 Well, then I talked about the piping.

524
0:20:47,060 --> 0:20:48,060
 It's very cheap piping.

525
0:20:48,060 --> 0:20:50,060
 In this case, 3 quarters of an inch,

526
0:20:50,060 --> 0:20:52,060
 because it fits in straight into the neck

527
0:20:52,060 --> 0:20:55,060
 of the fire extinguisher.

528
0:20:55,060 --> 0:20:57,060
 Then the copper tubing.

529
0:20:57,060 --> 0:20:59,060
 I have an example here.

530
0:20:59,060 --> 0:21:02,060
 This is 8 millimeter copper tubing.

531
0:21:02,060 --> 0:21:04,060
 I bend it into a ring.

532
0:21:04,060 --> 0:21:08,060
 And then I punch holes in the inside of the ring.

533
0:21:08,060 --> 0:21:10,060
 Because propane is heavier than air.

534
0:21:10,060 --> 0:21:12,060
 If you put it on the underside,

535
0:21:12,060 --> 0:21:14,060
 the propane will drop.

536
0:21:14,060 --> 0:21:16,060
 So you put it on the inside of the ring.

537
0:21:16,060 --> 0:21:19,060
 So the propane will get at least out like this.

538
0:21:19,060 --> 0:21:21,060
 And then get on fire.

539
0:21:21,060 --> 0:21:23,060
 And then you have the pilot flame.

540
0:21:23,060 --> 0:21:25,060
 And I also did some on the top.

541
0:21:25,060 --> 0:21:28,060
 So that it keeps on feeding the pilot flame.

542
0:21:29,060 --> 0:21:31,060
 You can just bend this.

543
0:21:31,060 --> 0:21:32,060
 I bought a pipe bending device.

544
0:21:32,060 --> 0:21:34,060
 One of the new ones I made.

545
0:21:34,060 --> 0:21:36,060
 I had to practice a little.

546
0:21:36,060 --> 0:21:37,060
 If you want really nice bends,

547
0:21:37,060 --> 0:21:39,060
 you can fill them with fine sand.

548
0:21:39,060 --> 0:21:42,060
 You have this fine sand.

549
0:21:42,060 --> 0:21:44,060
 You put it in and then bend it.

550
0:21:44,060 --> 0:21:46,060
 Then you can easily shake the sand out.

551
0:21:46,060 --> 0:21:48,060
 And then you can make nice bends.

552
0:21:48,060 --> 0:21:50,060
 This I just bent on the stone here

553
0:21:50,060 --> 0:21:52,060
 on a born hack.

554
0:21:52,060 --> 0:21:54,060
 This is a radiator clip.

555
0:21:54,060 --> 0:21:57,060
 It's also there to keep it in place.

556
0:21:57,060 --> 0:21:58,060
 The gas hose.

557
0:21:58,060 --> 0:22:00,060
 This is the hose that I use.

558
0:22:00,060 --> 0:22:03,060
 Firefighters are very, very interested in hearing

559
0:22:03,060 --> 0:22:05,060
 that you know that you should replace

560
0:22:05,060 --> 0:22:07,060
 these hoses every five years.

561
0:22:07,060 --> 0:22:09,060
 So the short piece I used here,

562
0:22:09,060 --> 0:22:11,060
 I used the one with the date on it.

563
0:22:11,060 --> 0:22:13,060
 So it says 2021.

564
0:22:13,060 --> 0:22:15,060
 So I can use this piece of hose

565
0:22:15,060 --> 0:22:17,060
 for the next five years on festivals.

566
0:22:17,060 --> 0:22:19,060
 So if they ask me about it,

567
0:22:19,060 --> 0:22:21,060
 I can show them.

568
0:22:21,060 --> 0:22:23,060
 And if you say that you saved this piece of hose

569
0:22:23,060 --> 0:22:25,060
 with the date on it,

570
0:22:25,060 --> 0:22:27,060
 they know that you know your stuff.

571
0:22:27,060 --> 0:22:29,060
 And that helps in getting approved.

572
0:22:29,060 --> 0:22:30,060
 Because some festivals say,

573
0:22:30,060 --> 0:22:31,060
 sorry, it's too dangerous.

574
0:22:31,060 --> 0:22:33,060
 We don't want it.

575
0:22:33,060 --> 0:22:35,060
 Most firefighters, if you show them,

576
0:22:35,060 --> 0:22:36,060
 and you let them know that you know

577
0:22:36,060 --> 0:22:38,060
 that propane is heavier than air,

578
0:22:38,060 --> 0:22:40,060
 that you took care of the gas storage,

579
0:22:40,060 --> 0:22:42,060
 and that you made them high up,

580
0:22:42,060 --> 0:22:44,060
 then they are most of the time

581
0:22:44,060 --> 0:22:46,060
 already very happy with you.

582
0:22:46,060 --> 0:22:48,060
 And they will give you an approval

583
0:22:48,060 --> 0:22:50,060
 to use them at festivals.

584
0:22:50,060 --> 0:22:52,060
 So use proper hoses.

585
0:22:52,060 --> 0:22:54,060
 And use them in a garbage bag.

586
0:22:54,060 --> 0:22:56,060
 So if you are done with the festival,

587
0:22:56,060 --> 0:22:58,060
 roll up the hose,

588
0:22:58,060 --> 0:23:00,060
 and put it in a garbage bag.

589
0:23:00,060 --> 0:23:04,060
 Because UV will make these hoses deteriorate.

590
0:23:04,060 --> 0:23:06,060
 They become cracks in it.

591
0:23:06,060 --> 0:23:09,060
 So the nicer it looks when the fireman checks it,

592
0:23:09,060 --> 0:23:11,060
 the better it is, of course.

593
0:23:11,060 --> 0:23:13,060
 Then you have the T-splits.

594
0:23:13,060 --> 0:23:15,060
 Well, that's the parts over here.

595
0:23:15,060 --> 0:23:17,060
 I already showed you.

596
0:23:17,060 --> 0:23:19,060
 It's very easy.

597
0:23:19,060 --> 0:23:21,060
 You need some connectors for the T-splits

598
0:23:21,060 --> 0:23:23,060
 to put them in.

599
0:23:23,060 --> 0:23:26,060
 I use the left hand and the right hand

600
0:23:26,060 --> 0:23:27,060
 connector.

601
0:23:27,060 --> 0:23:28,060
 I couldn't find it here.

602
0:23:28,060 --> 0:23:29,060
 I forgot it.

603
0:23:29,060 --> 0:23:32,060
 But it's this connector,

604
0:23:32,060 --> 0:23:34,060
 because this in the Netherlands

605
0:23:34,060 --> 0:23:35,060
 is left hand thread,

606
0:23:35,060 --> 0:23:36,060
 because it's gas.

607
0:23:36,060 --> 0:23:38,060
 You can recognize that,

608
0:23:38,060 --> 0:23:40,060
 because on the nut

609
0:23:40,060 --> 0:23:42,060
 there will be an indentation around it.

610
0:23:42,060 --> 0:23:44,060
 So if you see a nut with small marks on it,

611
0:23:44,060 --> 0:23:45,060
 it's not damaged.

612
0:23:45,060 --> 0:23:47,060
 It means it's left hand thread.

613
0:23:47,060 --> 0:23:49,060
 So it's not righty-tighty,

614
0:23:49,060 --> 0:23:51,060
 but it's lefty-tighty.

615
0:23:52,060 --> 0:23:55,060
 The T-split is a normal one.

616
0:23:55,060 --> 0:23:57,060
 A normal one and a half,

617
0:23:57,060 --> 0:23:59,060
 normal half inch thread.

618
0:23:59,060 --> 0:24:00,060
 So therefore you need a converter

619
0:24:00,060 --> 0:24:02,060
 to go from normal thread

620
0:24:02,060 --> 0:24:04,060
 to left hand thread.

621
0:24:04,060 --> 0:24:06,060
 Then there are some converter rings

622
0:24:06,060 --> 0:24:08,060
 which are used in here.

623
0:24:08,060 --> 0:24:10,060
 So you go in with the hose pillar

624
0:24:10,060 --> 0:24:13,060
 and then go to three quarters of an inch.

625
0:24:13,060 --> 0:24:15,060
 So that's all stuff that's only costing

626
0:24:15,060 --> 0:24:17,060
 like one or two euros.

627
0:24:17,060 --> 0:24:19,060
 Then you have the clamp I talked about

628
0:24:19,060 --> 0:24:21,060
 to hold the piece of copper to the big tube.

629
0:24:21,060 --> 0:24:24,060
 Steel wool, kitchen sponges,

630
0:24:24,060 --> 0:24:26,060
 69 cents in the supermarket.

631
0:24:28,060 --> 0:24:30,060
 Something like, what is it?

632
0:24:30,060 --> 0:24:32,060
 Six kroner or something.

633
0:24:35,060 --> 0:24:36,060
 Some iron wire.

634
0:24:36,060 --> 0:24:40,060
 That's very nice to hold the copper steel wool

635
0:24:40,060 --> 0:24:43,060
 into place as the pilot flame.

636
0:24:43,060 --> 0:24:47,060
 You need the Teflon tape to seal.

637
0:24:47,060 --> 0:24:48,060
 You can see it here.

638
0:24:48,060 --> 0:24:50,060
 All the white stuff is Teflon tape.

639
0:24:50,060 --> 0:24:52,060
 But if you have to build this,

640
0:24:52,060 --> 0:24:53,060
 you have like one, two, three.

641
0:24:53,060 --> 0:24:54,060
 You have lots of connections.

642
0:24:54,060 --> 0:24:58,060
 You have to roll the Teflon tape or wire.

643
0:24:58,060 --> 0:24:59,060
 Wire is easier.

644
0:24:59,060 --> 0:25:00,060
 This is Teflon wire.

645
0:25:00,060 --> 0:25:02,060
 You can nicely fit it in the threads.

646
0:25:02,060 --> 0:25:05,060
 Makes it already work easier.

647
0:25:05,060 --> 0:25:09,060
 But I find this is a hydraulic sealant.

648
0:25:09,060 --> 0:25:12,060
 This is capable of extending 320 bars.

649
0:25:12,060 --> 0:25:14,060
 So you can also put this on

650
0:25:14,060 --> 0:25:15,060
 and it's really quick.

651
0:25:15,060 --> 0:25:17,060
 It needs some time to dry.

652
0:25:17,060 --> 0:25:18,060
 So you can't use it immediately.

653
0:25:18,060 --> 0:25:19,060
 But if you're making it

654
0:25:19,060 --> 0:25:20,060
 and using it the next day,

655
0:25:20,060 --> 0:25:22,060
 you can put this in the threads.

656
0:25:22,060 --> 0:25:24,060
 You can just screw the whole thing together.

657
0:25:24,060 --> 0:25:26,060
 So it's all mounted.

658
0:25:26,060 --> 0:25:28,060
 Leave it to harden.

659
0:25:28,060 --> 0:25:29,060
 And then you're done.

660
0:25:29,060 --> 0:25:30,060
 And you don't have to check.

661
0:25:30,060 --> 0:25:33,060
 And then, yeah, it's very good.

662
0:25:33,060 --> 0:25:35,060
 It fills the threads.

663
0:25:35,060 --> 0:25:37,060
 And then I would suggest buying a bottle of,

664
0:25:37,060 --> 0:25:40,060
 yeah, it's basically dishwashing liquid

665
0:25:40,060 --> 0:25:42,060
 in a spray can.

666
0:25:42,060 --> 0:25:43,060
 It's a leak detector.

667
0:25:43,060 --> 0:25:44,060
 So when you're done,

668
0:25:44,060 --> 0:25:46,060
 you put pressure on it.

669
0:25:46,060 --> 0:25:47,060
 You could also use air

670
0:25:47,060 --> 0:25:48,060
 if you're really careful.

671
0:25:49,060 --> 0:25:59,060
 Sorry.

672
0:25:59,060 --> 0:26:02,060
 You could use compressed air to test it.

673
0:26:02,060 --> 0:26:04,060
 So you pressurize the whole system.

674
0:26:04,060 --> 0:26:05,060
 If the valve is closed,

675
0:26:05,060 --> 0:26:08,060
 only some air should go out there,

676
0:26:08,060 --> 0:26:11,060
 but not through all the connections.

677
0:26:11,060 --> 0:26:14,060
 But you can use this liquid gas leak detection.

678
0:26:14,060 --> 0:26:15,060
 You spray it on.

679
0:26:15,060 --> 0:26:16,060
 And if there's a gas leak,

680
0:26:16,060 --> 0:26:18,060
 it will form bubbles.

681
0:26:18,060 --> 0:26:20,060
 So then stop the gas,

682
0:26:20,060 --> 0:26:22,060
 take apart that connection,

683
0:26:22,060 --> 0:26:24,060
 and try again.

684
0:26:24,060 --> 0:26:26,060
 And then there's some hose clamps.

685
0:26:26,060 --> 0:26:28,060
 You need some hose clamps

686
0:26:28,060 --> 0:26:30,060
 to keep this in place,

687
0:26:30,060 --> 0:26:32,060
 to keep this in place,

688
0:26:32,060 --> 0:26:33,060
 and one on the regulator.

689
0:26:33,060 --> 0:26:35,060
 So you need four hose clamps.

690
0:26:35,060 --> 0:26:36,060
 So all in all,

691
0:26:36,060 --> 0:26:38,060
 you can build this for around,

692
0:26:38,060 --> 0:26:40,060
 I think, 100 euros.

693
0:26:40,060 --> 0:26:44,060
 So that's 700 kroner.

694
0:26:48,060 --> 0:26:56,060
 Some best practices.

695
0:26:56,060 --> 0:26:58,060
 Store gas cans in a container

696
0:26:58,060 --> 0:27:00,060
 or bucket of water.

697
0:27:00,060 --> 0:27:02,060
 On the EMF camp,

698
0:27:02,060 --> 0:27:05,060
 I used the 600 liter garbage container,

699
0:27:05,060 --> 0:27:06,060
 the blue ones,

700
0:27:06,060 --> 0:27:07,060
 the very big ones,

701
0:27:07,060 --> 0:27:10,060
 normally used for paper collection.

702
0:27:10,060 --> 0:27:12,060
 I put four gas bottles in them,

703
0:27:12,060 --> 0:27:13,060
 600 liters of water.

704
0:27:13,060 --> 0:27:14,060
 In the end of the night,

705
0:27:14,060 --> 0:27:16,060
 it was one cubic meter of ice

706
0:27:16,060 --> 0:27:18,060
 with four bottles frozen into them.

707
0:27:18,060 --> 0:27:20,060
 So the bottles will freeze up.

708
0:27:20,060 --> 0:27:21,060
 The best thing is

709
0:27:21,060 --> 0:27:23,060
 to really submerge them in water.

710
0:27:23,060 --> 0:27:24,060
 The regulator can take that.

711
0:27:24,060 --> 0:27:25,060
 It's no problem.

712
0:27:25,060 --> 0:27:27,060
 So take the whole bottle.

713
0:27:27,060 --> 0:27:28,060
 We took four.

714
0:27:28,060 --> 0:27:29,060
 We took a pallet,

715
0:27:29,060 --> 0:27:30,060
 a wooden pallet,

716
0:27:30,060 --> 0:27:31,060
 put it on top,

717
0:27:31,060 --> 0:27:32,060
 pressed them down

718
0:27:32,060 --> 0:27:33,060
 so the bottles were completely

719
0:27:33,060 --> 0:27:34,060
 submerged in water.

720
0:27:34,060 --> 0:27:35,060
 And even then,

721
0:27:35,060 --> 0:27:37,060
 it took a night of playing,

722
0:27:37,060 --> 0:27:38,060
 but even then,

723
0:27:38,060 --> 0:27:39,060
 the bottles were frozen up.

724
0:27:39,060 --> 0:27:41,060
 We burned 600 kilos of propane

725
0:27:41,060 --> 0:27:42,060
 in that weekend.

726
0:27:42,060 --> 0:27:43,060
 So in three days,

727
0:27:43,060 --> 0:27:45,060
 we burned 600 kilos of propane.

728
0:27:45,060 --> 0:27:46,060
 It was a lot,

729
0:27:46,060 --> 0:27:48,060
 and it was really awesome.

730
0:27:48,060 --> 0:27:50,060
 This is how we do it at Bornhek.

731
0:27:50,060 --> 0:27:52,060
 They are behind the info desk.

732
0:27:52,060 --> 0:27:54,060
 We took cement tubs,

733
0:27:54,060 --> 0:27:57,060
 but you see they are not completely covered,

734
0:27:57,060 --> 0:28:00,060
 so they are freezing up faster.

735
0:28:00,060 --> 0:28:01,060
 A better idea would be

736
0:28:01,060 --> 0:28:03,060
 to take the gray containers

737
0:28:03,060 --> 0:28:05,060
 and put them in completely

738
0:28:05,060 --> 0:28:06,060
 and press them down.

739
0:28:06,060 --> 0:28:08,060
 That would have been a better solution,

740
0:28:08,060 --> 0:28:10,060
 but we're short of containers.

741
0:28:10,060 --> 0:28:12,060
 So we fix it like this.

742
0:28:12,060 --> 0:28:13,060
 So the bottles are there,

743
0:28:13,060 --> 0:28:15,060
 open air as you can see.

744
0:28:15,060 --> 0:28:16,060
 So if there is something,

745
0:28:16,060 --> 0:28:17,060
 a leak or whatever,

746
0:28:17,060 --> 0:28:19,060
 the gas will just blow away.

747
0:28:19,060 --> 0:28:21,060
 So don't, again,

748
0:28:21,060 --> 0:28:23,060
 don't make a box around it

749
0:28:23,060 --> 0:28:25,060
 or try to seal them or whatever.

750
0:28:25,060 --> 0:28:26,060
 Leave them there,

751
0:28:26,060 --> 0:28:29,060
 and everybody sees it's the flames,

752
0:28:29,060 --> 0:28:32,060
 so they won't touch it.

753
0:28:34,060 --> 0:28:37,060
 This is what happens after 45 minutes.

754
0:28:37,060 --> 0:28:38,060
 This is the regulator.

755
0:28:38,060 --> 0:28:40,060
 This is my high pressure regulator,

756
0:28:40,060 --> 0:28:41,060
 zero to four bars.

757
0:28:41,060 --> 0:28:42,060
 As you can see,

758
0:28:42,060 --> 0:28:44,060
 it's almost fully open,

759
0:28:44,060 --> 0:28:46,060
 so it was at four bars.

760
0:28:46,060 --> 0:28:48,060
 And after 45 minutes,

761
0:28:48,060 --> 0:28:50,060
 the water in the buckets,

762
0:28:50,060 --> 0:28:52,060
 these buckets,

763
0:28:52,060 --> 0:28:54,060
 dropped to 5.5 degrees.

764
0:28:54,060 --> 0:28:56,060
 So my friends dropped their beer in it.

765
0:28:56,060 --> 0:28:59,060
 It was a very good beer cooler,

766
0:28:59,060 --> 0:29:01,060
 but the regulator froze up.

767
0:29:01,060 --> 0:29:02,060
 And when this is starting to happen,

768
0:29:02,060 --> 0:29:04,060
 you will see the pressure drops.

769
0:29:04,060 --> 0:29:06,060
 So then you will see the flames go down.

770
0:29:06,060 --> 0:29:08,060
 If you submerge the whole bottle,

771
0:29:08,060 --> 0:29:09,060
 including the regulator,

772
0:29:09,060 --> 0:29:12,060
 you will prevent the water from,

773
0:29:12,060 --> 0:29:14,060
 the regulator from freezing up.

774
0:29:14,060 --> 0:29:15,060
 So you keep longer high pressure.

775
0:29:16,060 --> 0:29:19,060
 This was the bottom of the gas bottle.

776
0:29:19,060 --> 0:29:20,060
 When we were done,

777
0:29:20,060 --> 0:29:23,060
 it was covered in two centimeters of ice.

778
0:29:23,060 --> 0:29:24,060
 So we took it out.

779
0:29:24,060 --> 0:29:25,060
 Beer was ice cold,

780
0:29:25,060 --> 0:29:28,060
 and we had like a cap of ice underneath the bottle.

781
0:29:28,060 --> 0:29:30,060
 When we put it on the floor,

782
0:29:30,060 --> 0:29:31,060
 it broke off,

783
0:29:31,060 --> 0:29:33,060
 and it was two centimeters thick.

784
0:29:33,060 --> 0:29:36,060
 And that was just probably one hour of playing.

785
0:29:39,060 --> 0:29:42,060
 Some improvements I made during camp,

786
0:29:42,060 --> 0:29:44,060
 which I was really happy with.

787
0:29:44,060 --> 0:29:45,060
 The first nights,

788
0:29:45,060 --> 0:29:47,060
 I took a,

789
0:29:47,060 --> 0:29:48,060
 how do you say,

790
0:29:48,060 --> 0:29:49,060
 fireplace lighter,

791
0:29:49,060 --> 0:29:50,060
 the long lighter,

792
0:29:50,060 --> 0:29:53,060
 and put it on a long stick with a wire.

793
0:29:53,060 --> 0:29:54,060
 It worked for the first night.

794
0:29:54,060 --> 0:29:55,060
 The second night,

795
0:29:55,060 --> 0:29:57,060
 the button already broke.

796
0:29:57,060 --> 0:30:00,060
 So we were trying to get it to light at three meters high,

797
0:30:00,060 --> 0:30:01,060
 stay away from the flame,

798
0:30:01,060 --> 0:30:03,060
 and we tried to light it.

799
0:30:03,060 --> 0:30:05,060
 It didn't work really well.

800
0:30:05,060 --> 0:30:07,060
 So I thought of automating it.

801
0:30:07,060 --> 0:30:10,060
 I brought glow plugs with me,

802
0:30:10,060 --> 0:30:11,060
 the diesel heater glow plugs.

803
0:30:11,060 --> 0:30:14,060
 They are like four centimeter sticks of silicon nitride.

804
0:30:14,060 --> 0:30:17,060
 With two wires,

805
0:30:17,060 --> 0:30:19,060
 basically wire wrapped around them,

806
0:30:19,060 --> 0:30:21,060
 because you can't solder on that stuff.

807
0:30:21,060 --> 0:30:22,060
 And basically it's just short.

808
0:30:22,060 --> 0:30:24,060
 It's a one ohm resistor,

809
0:30:24,060 --> 0:30:29,060
 and it turns into 1300 degree orange glow.

810
0:30:29,060 --> 0:30:31,060
 So you will see if I light them,

811
0:30:31,060 --> 0:30:32,060
 it glows orange,

812
0:30:32,060 --> 0:30:34,060
 and then I'll just open the gas.

813
0:30:34,060 --> 0:30:38,060
 It will flow next to the glow plug,

814
0:30:38,060 --> 0:30:40,060
 and then it will ignite.

815
0:30:40,060 --> 0:30:42,060
 So I don't have to go up.

816
0:30:42,060 --> 0:30:43,060
 We don't have to be with the stick,

817
0:30:43,060 --> 0:30:44,060
 and the lighter.

818
0:30:44,060 --> 0:30:46,060
 We just press a button.

819
0:30:46,060 --> 0:30:49,060
 It's the fourth channel on my DMX controller.

820
0:30:49,060 --> 0:30:50,060
 So it will,

821
0:30:50,060 --> 0:30:52,060
 the outer sides are on glow plugs,

822
0:30:52,060 --> 0:30:55,060
 and the inner one is a,

823
0:30:55,060 --> 0:30:58,060
 an ignition for a central heating system in the house.

824
0:30:58,060 --> 0:31:00,060
 So if you have a gas heating in the house,

825
0:31:00,060 --> 0:31:02,060
 there's a small box that makes 11 kilovolts,

826
0:31:02,060 --> 0:31:04,060
 two electrodes,

827
0:31:04,060 --> 0:31:05,060
 and it sparks,

828
0:31:05,060 --> 0:31:06,060
 and you can hear it.

829
0:31:06,060 --> 0:31:07,060
 When I light the button,

830
0:31:07,060 --> 0:31:09,060
 you hear zzzzzzzz.

831
0:31:09,060 --> 0:31:10,060
 And then when you flow the gas,

832
0:31:10,060 --> 0:31:11,060
 it goes on.

833
0:31:11,060 --> 0:31:12,060
 So,

834
0:31:12,060 --> 0:31:14,060
 sometimes it can take a while with the glow plugs,

835
0:31:14,060 --> 0:31:16,060
 because the left glow plug is a bit slow,

836
0:31:16,060 --> 0:31:17,060
 I saw.

837
0:31:17,060 --> 0:31:19,060
 So it took some tries.

838
0:31:19,060 --> 0:31:21,060
 And what you can then do is just fire the thing.

839
0:31:21,060 --> 0:31:24,060
 So then the glow plug gets a lot of propane,

840
0:31:24,060 --> 0:31:25,060
 and it goes around.

841
0:31:25,060 --> 0:31:27,060
 It gets into a combustible mixture,

842
0:31:27,060 --> 0:31:29,060
 and then it turns on anyway.

843
0:31:32,060 --> 0:31:33,060
 If you can,

844
0:31:33,060 --> 0:31:35,060
 use a DMX safety channel.

845
0:31:35,060 --> 0:31:37,060
 So most DMX controllers,

846
0:31:37,060 --> 0:31:39,060
 you can say,

847
0:31:39,060 --> 0:31:42,060
 if this channel is between 25 and 30,

848
0:31:42,060 --> 0:31:45,060
 and 128 for instance,

849
0:31:45,060 --> 0:31:48,060
 then you are only allowed to open up the other channel,

850
0:31:48,060 --> 0:31:50,060
 and then you will fire.

851
0:31:50,060 --> 0:31:51,060
 If you make it like that,

852
0:31:51,060 --> 0:31:52,060
 in your Arduino application,

853
0:31:52,060 --> 0:31:55,060
 if you do it in Arduino or Raspberry Pi,

854
0:31:55,060 --> 0:31:57,060
 then you have to open two channels.

855
0:31:57,060 --> 0:32:00,060
 So when somebody pulls all the buttons all the way down,

856
0:32:00,060 --> 0:32:03,060
 then they are not between that certain safety range,

857
0:32:03,060 --> 0:32:05,060
 and then nothing will happen.

858
0:32:05,060 --> 0:32:08,060
 So the safety slider needs to be at a certain position,

859
0:32:08,060 --> 0:32:10,060
 and you can decide how much it is.

860
0:32:10,060 --> 0:32:11,060
 You can also say,

861
0:32:11,060 --> 0:32:12,060
 like 57 and 60,

862
0:32:12,060 --> 0:32:14,060
 so it is very specific.

863
0:32:14,060 --> 0:32:16,060
 So if someone starts playing with it,

864
0:32:16,060 --> 0:32:17,060
 it won't fire.

865
0:32:17,060 --> 0:32:18,060
 So if you can do that,

866
0:32:18,060 --> 0:32:19,060
 it is safer,

867
0:32:19,060 --> 0:32:22,060
 and especially when you do shows with bands and stuff,

868
0:32:22,060 --> 0:32:24,060
 they want to see this.

869
0:32:24,060 --> 0:32:27,060
 They want to see if you have a safety channel.

870
0:32:28,060 --> 0:32:30,060
 You can tune the length of the pipes.

871
0:32:30,060 --> 0:32:32,060
 Yesterday I tried to play some songs,

872
0:32:32,060 --> 0:32:34,060
 by just...

873
0:32:34,060 --> 0:32:36,060
 But if you make different lengths of pipe,

874
0:32:36,060 --> 0:32:37,060
 you can tune them,

875
0:32:37,060 --> 0:32:39,060
 and you can make your own organ with them.

876
0:32:39,060 --> 0:32:40,060
 So if you make four of them,

877
0:32:40,060 --> 0:32:42,060
 and you make a 10-centimeter pipe,

878
0:32:42,060 --> 0:32:44,060
 15, 20, and 30,

879
0:32:44,060 --> 0:32:46,060
 then you have different tones,

880
0:32:46,060 --> 0:32:49,060
 from low bass to really...

881
0:32:49,060 --> 0:32:50,060
 very high ones.

882
0:32:50,060 --> 0:32:52,060
 So that is really nice.

883
0:32:54,060 --> 0:32:56,060
 And use the biggest gas bottle.

884
0:32:56,060 --> 0:32:58,060
 That doesn't have to...

885
0:32:58,060 --> 0:33:00,060
 I don't mean that you need a lot of gas,

886
0:33:00,060 --> 0:33:01,060
 of course,

887
0:33:01,060 --> 0:33:04,060
 it takes you longer to switch the bottle,

888
0:33:04,060 --> 0:33:07,060
 but the bigger bottle has a bigger surface.

889
0:33:07,060 --> 0:33:09,060
 So the evaporation goes faster,

890
0:33:09,060 --> 0:33:11,060
 so your refilling of the storage buffer,

891
0:33:11,060 --> 0:33:13,060
 the fire extinguisher,

892
0:33:13,060 --> 0:33:14,060
 that goes faster.

893
0:33:14,060 --> 0:33:16,060
 If you can evaporate more gas,

894
0:33:16,060 --> 0:33:18,060
 then you can do...

895
0:33:18,060 --> 0:33:19,060
 You can continue to shoot,

896
0:33:19,060 --> 0:33:22,060
 and now you have to sometimes wait

897
0:33:22,060 --> 0:33:24,060
 for it to fill.

898
0:33:24,060 --> 0:33:26,060
 So bigger bottle,

899
0:33:26,060 --> 0:33:28,060
 shorter hose length,

900
0:33:28,060 --> 0:33:30,060
 high pressure regulator,

901
0:33:30,060 --> 0:33:31,060
 that is all...

902
0:33:31,060 --> 0:33:33,060
 are all factors

903
0:33:33,060 --> 0:33:35,060
 that make how fast you can reload your bottle,

904
0:33:35,060 --> 0:33:37,060
 and the size of the bottle.

905
0:33:37,060 --> 0:33:38,060
 As you can see, the middle one,

906
0:33:38,060 --> 0:33:40,060
 it's way faster than the other ones,

907
0:33:40,060 --> 0:33:42,060
 because it's only two kilos.

908
0:33:42,060 --> 0:33:44,060
 So it's a third of the capacity,

909
0:33:44,060 --> 0:33:46,060
 and the flame should shot just as high.

910
0:33:46,060 --> 0:33:49,060
 So I might be looking for small bottles in the future.

911
0:33:49,060 --> 0:33:51,060
 They're a little rare,

912
0:33:51,060 --> 0:33:53,060
 but at least I have six at home,

913
0:33:53,060 --> 0:33:55,060
 so the first six I can build.

914
0:33:57,060 --> 0:33:58,060
 Then, well,

915
0:33:58,060 --> 0:34:00,060
 we talked already about storing them

916
0:34:00,060 --> 0:34:02,060
 in a bucket of water.

917
0:34:02,060 --> 0:34:04,060
 Yeah, the last thing is

918
0:34:04,060 --> 0:34:06,060
 always unplug them when surfacing.

919
0:34:06,060 --> 0:34:07,060
 So when you are there,

920
0:34:07,060 --> 0:34:09,060
 your friend is not able to push the button,

921
0:34:09,060 --> 0:34:11,060
 because that's not funny.

922
0:34:11,060 --> 0:34:12,060
 It needs to be safe,

923
0:34:12,060 --> 0:34:14,060
 so always unplug it.

924
0:34:14,060 --> 0:34:16,060
 You never know if you make your own Arduino,

925
0:34:16,060 --> 0:34:17,060
 I don't know,

926
0:34:17,060 --> 0:34:18,060
 you make a counter wrong or whatever,

927
0:34:18,060 --> 0:34:19,060
 and you're there,

928
0:34:19,060 --> 0:34:20,060
 and the thing fires,

929
0:34:20,060 --> 0:34:21,060
 and you don't want to be near the fire

930
0:34:21,060 --> 0:34:22,060
 when it fires.

931
0:34:22,060 --> 0:34:23,060
 It's very hot,

932
0:34:23,060 --> 0:34:25,060
 and you don't want to get burned.

933
0:34:25,060 --> 0:34:27,060
 Rule zero, don't be on fire.

934
0:34:29,060 --> 0:34:32,060
 So now I will switch to a video I made.

935
0:34:32,060 --> 0:34:38,060
 This is during camp,

936
0:34:38,060 --> 0:34:41,060
 and here you see a prototype.

937
0:34:41,060 --> 0:34:42,060
 And as I said,

938
0:34:42,060 --> 0:34:44,060
 use something metal to mount it.

939
0:34:44,060 --> 0:34:45,060
 It was on the floor.

940
0:34:45,060 --> 0:34:47,060
 We didn't want to climb up every time,

941
0:34:47,060 --> 0:34:49,060
 so I used a cart,

942
0:34:49,060 --> 0:34:51,060
 a trolley,

943
0:34:51,060 --> 0:34:53,060
 which we put on the side,

944
0:34:53,060 --> 0:34:55,060
 so we have something metal to attach it to.

945
0:34:55,060 --> 0:34:58,060
 So we ratchet strapped it to the metal trolley,

946
0:34:58,060 --> 0:35:01,060
 and then we just tested this.

947
0:35:01,060 --> 0:35:02,060
 This is the small bottle.

948
0:35:02,060 --> 0:35:04,060
 This is a two kilo fire extinguisher,

949
0:35:04,060 --> 0:35:06,060
 but we put it on four bars,

950
0:35:06,060 --> 0:35:08,060
 so it went something like this.

951
0:35:14,060 --> 0:35:16,060
 So here you see the pilot flame.

952
0:35:16,060 --> 0:35:17,060
 It's still burning.

953
0:35:17,060 --> 0:35:19,060
 I have made some videos,

954
0:35:19,060 --> 0:35:22,060
 some different videos to show you.

955
0:35:22,060 --> 0:35:23,060
 These are the three of them.

956
0:35:23,060 --> 0:35:25,060
 The middle one is the small bottle,

957
0:35:25,060 --> 0:35:27,060
 but look at the size in flames.

958
0:35:27,060 --> 0:35:31,060
 You don't really see a very big difference.

959
0:35:31,060 --> 0:35:33,060
 So this one goes up.

960
0:35:33,060 --> 0:35:38,060
 This one shoots up maybe a little lower.

961
0:35:38,060 --> 0:35:41,060
 Could also be that the pressure was low,

962
0:35:41,060 --> 0:35:43,060
 because in the next video we'll see

963
0:35:43,060 --> 0:35:45,060
 it shoot up at least the same height.

964
0:35:45,060 --> 0:35:47,060
 We mounted them on pellets,

965
0:35:47,060 --> 0:35:49,060
 so we put pellets on the container,

966
0:35:49,060 --> 0:35:52,060
 and we put a wooden stick on it,

967
0:35:52,060 --> 0:35:54,060
 and then we ratchet strapped it.

968
0:35:54,060 --> 0:35:59,060
 These are made at 240 frames per second,

969
0:35:59,060 --> 0:36:00,060
 so we can see.

970
0:36:00,060 --> 0:36:02,060
 And now you can see that the middle one

971
0:36:02,060 --> 0:36:04,060
 is not lower than the other one.

972
0:36:04,060 --> 0:36:07,060
 So the two liter bottle works fine as well.

973
0:36:11,060 --> 0:36:13,060
 And now I think the next movie will show you

974
0:36:13,060 --> 0:36:14,060
 that the pilot flame,

975
0:36:14,060 --> 0:36:16,060
 when you shoot,

976
0:36:16,060 --> 0:36:21,060
 you will see some distance between the pilot flame

977
0:36:21,060 --> 0:36:23,060
 and where the gas ignites.

978
0:36:23,060 --> 0:36:24,060
 So when it shoots,

979
0:36:24,060 --> 0:36:26,060
 you see a space where it isn't burning.

980
0:36:28,060 --> 0:36:30,060
 And that's because it's not,

981
0:36:30,060 --> 0:36:33,060
 it's there, it's pure propane at that point.

982
0:36:38,060 --> 0:36:41,060
 And this is the only time you are allowed

983
0:36:41,060 --> 0:36:44,060
 to film vertically.

984
0:36:44,060 --> 0:36:45,060
 So the vertical video syndrome,

985
0:36:45,060 --> 0:36:46,060
 when you make flamethrowers,

986
0:36:46,060 --> 0:36:48,060
 is not an issue.

987
0:36:48,060 --> 0:36:50,060
 Because you want to have the full flame on it,

988
0:36:50,060 --> 0:36:51,060
 and not be like,

989
0:36:51,060 --> 0:36:54,060
 ah shit, I missed the top of the flame.

990
0:36:57,060 --> 0:36:58,060
 So yeah.

991
0:36:58,060 --> 0:37:01,060
 This is the end of my presentation.

992
0:37:01,060 --> 0:37:03,060
 If there's any questions,

993
0:37:03,060 --> 0:37:05,060
 I would love to hear them.

994
0:37:05,060 --> 0:37:07,060
 You can always contact me,

995
0:37:07,060 --> 0:37:09,060
 I'll be Bob at Bitler.

996
0:37:09,060 --> 0:37:11,060
 I'm the chairman of Bitler Hackerspace.

997
0:37:11,060 --> 0:37:13,060
 You can find me on Twitter.

998
0:37:13,060 --> 0:37:15,060
 And I saw a question in the back.

999
0:37:18,060 --> 0:37:19,060
 Thank you.

1000
0:37:19,060 --> 0:37:20,060
 I'll be right down.

1001
0:37:24,060 --> 0:37:25,060
 Bye bye.

1002
0:37:28,060 --> 0:37:33,060
 Do you ever have issues with the backfire?

1003
0:37:33,060 --> 0:37:34,060
 So when you,

1004
0:37:34,060 --> 0:37:37,060
 we're talking about the mix of the gas,

1005
0:37:37,060 --> 0:37:39,060
 and if it's too high or too low,

1006
0:37:39,060 --> 0:37:40,060
 then nothing happens.

1007
0:37:40,060 --> 0:37:42,060
 But when you turn this thing on and off,

1008
0:37:42,060 --> 0:37:45,060
 you must have the proper mix inside the barrel

1009
0:37:45,060 --> 0:37:46,060
 from time to time,

1010
0:37:46,060 --> 0:37:48,060
 so you'll have fire going inside.

1011
0:37:53,060 --> 0:37:54,060
 Hello.

1012
0:37:54,060 --> 0:37:55,060
 Yeah.

1013
0:37:55,060 --> 0:37:57,060
 That's a very good question.

1014
0:37:57,060 --> 0:37:59,060
 Inside the bottle,

1015
0:37:59,060 --> 0:38:01,060
 the mixture is pure propane.

1016
0:38:01,060 --> 0:38:02,060
 There's a valve in between,

1017
0:38:02,060 --> 0:38:04,060
 that has a very small hole.

1018
0:38:04,060 --> 0:38:07,060
 And the mixture is still pure propane,

1019
0:38:07,060 --> 0:38:08,060
 so it doesn't go back,

1020
0:38:08,060 --> 0:38:10,060
 because the pressure is upwards.

1021
0:38:10,060 --> 0:38:12,060
 It's the pressure difference

1022
0:38:12,060 --> 0:38:14,060
 between outside the bottle and inside

1023
0:38:14,060 --> 0:38:17,060
 is at least two to three bars.

1024
0:38:17,060 --> 0:38:19,060
 So the pressure is upwards.

1025
0:38:19,060 --> 0:38:20,060
 So the flame won't go in

1026
0:38:20,060 --> 0:38:22,060
 because there's no combustible mixture

1027
0:38:22,060 --> 0:38:24,060
 there at that moment.

1028
0:38:24,060 --> 0:38:26,060
 So in the whole hose from the gas bottle,

1029
0:38:26,060 --> 0:38:28,060
 to the container,

1030
0:38:28,060 --> 0:38:30,060
 it's all pure propane.

1031
0:38:30,060 --> 0:38:31,060
 And only when it gets out,

1032
0:38:31,060 --> 0:38:33,060
 it gets to the point that it can combust.

1033
0:38:33,060 --> 0:38:36,060
 So there's no chance of the flame shooting backwards.

1034
0:38:36,060 --> 0:38:41,060
 And there is always the valve in between.

1035
0:38:41,060 --> 0:38:43,060
 And if you look inside the valve,

1036
0:38:43,060 --> 0:38:47,060
 it seriously has only a diameter of a very thin hole.

1037
0:38:47,060 --> 0:38:48,060
 So a lot of,

1038
0:38:48,060 --> 0:38:52,060
 the air speed through the valve is really high.

1039
0:38:52,060 --> 0:38:55,060
 So as long as you have pure propane,

1040
0:38:55,060 --> 0:38:56,060
 people say,

1041
0:38:56,060 --> 0:38:58,060
 hey, why don't you put a compressor on it?

1042
0:38:58,060 --> 0:38:59,060
 And then you can compress it,

1043
0:38:59,060 --> 0:39:01,060
 and then you can go up to 16 bars,

1044
0:39:01,060 --> 0:39:03,060
 and then you have propane in there and air,

1045
0:39:03,060 --> 0:39:05,060
 and then it gets dangerous,

1046
0:39:05,060 --> 0:39:07,060
 because then you're making a combustible mixture

1047
0:39:07,060 --> 0:39:08,060
 inside the bottle.

1048
0:39:08,060 --> 0:39:10,060
 And then you can't guarantee

1049
0:39:10,060 --> 0:39:12,060
 that the flame won't go back,

1050
0:39:12,060 --> 0:39:14,060
 because you have a very highly explosive mixture

1051
0:39:14,060 --> 0:39:15,060
 in the bottle.

1052
0:39:15,060 --> 0:39:17,060
 So stay away from that.

1053
0:39:17,060 --> 0:39:19,060
 That's a good question.

1054
0:39:19,060 --> 0:39:22,060
 Yes, other questions?

1055
0:39:25,060 --> 0:39:34,060
 Have you thought about doing a supply line

1056
0:39:34,060 --> 0:39:36,060
 of ice cubes to the bar?

1057
0:39:36,060 --> 0:39:39,060
 I think we could have a good slogan,

1058
0:39:39,060 --> 0:39:42,060
 cool by fire flamethrowers.

1059
0:39:42,060 --> 0:39:44,060
 That would be a good idea for next year.

1060
0:39:44,060 --> 0:39:45,060
 Put the beer in there,

1061
0:39:45,060 --> 0:39:48,060
 and then have a gas line running from the bar

1062
0:39:48,060 --> 0:39:49,060
 to the flamethrowers,

1063
0:39:49,060 --> 0:39:51,060
 and then we can make ice.

1064
0:39:51,060 --> 0:39:54,060
 You're allowed to put your beer in there tonight,

1065
0:39:54,060 --> 0:39:55,060
 and you can see for yourself

1066
0:39:55,060 --> 0:39:57,060
 that we can really cool it.

1067
0:39:57,060 --> 0:39:59,060
 And in fact, everyone is welcome tonight

1068
0:39:59,060 --> 0:40:01,060
 at around 10ish, 10 o'clock.

1069
0:40:01,060 --> 0:40:03,060
 You will hear the flames go off,

1070
0:40:03,060 --> 0:40:05,060
 so I invite you all to get there,

1071
0:40:05,060 --> 0:40:08,060
 and if you like, I can show you backstage,

1072
0:40:08,060 --> 0:40:10,060
 and you can feel the water.

1073
0:40:10,060 --> 0:40:13,060
 We put a digital temp meter in it,

1074
0:40:13,060 --> 0:40:15,060
 so you can see really the temperature go down

1075
0:40:15,060 --> 0:40:18,060
 as the flames are used more and more.

1076
0:40:21,060 --> 0:40:23,060
 Have you tried different gas mixtures

1077
0:40:23,060 --> 0:40:24,060
 in the flamethrowers?

1078
0:40:24,060 --> 0:40:27,060
 I have just propane, propane, butane mix.

1079
0:40:27,060 --> 0:40:30,060
 Yes, I have also tried pure butane,

1080
0:40:30,060 --> 0:40:33,060
 and I noticed that it's great for indoor use,

1081
0:40:33,060 --> 0:40:35,060
 because you get flames like this high,

1082
0:40:35,060 --> 0:40:38,060
 so the caloric value is around the same,

1083
0:40:38,060 --> 0:40:39,060
 but for some reason,

1084
0:40:39,060 --> 0:40:42,060
 the boiling point of butane is around zero degrees,

1085
0:40:42,060 --> 0:40:43,060
 so if the bottle gets cold,

1086
0:40:43,060 --> 0:40:45,060
 the pressure drops immediately,

1087
0:40:45,060 --> 0:40:47,060
 so you end up in like half an hour

1088
0:40:47,060 --> 0:40:49,060
 with a half a meter flame,

1089
0:40:49,060 --> 0:40:51,060
 so you can fire as much as you like.

1090
0:40:51,060 --> 0:40:53,060
 So that is not a good mixture.

1091
0:40:53,060 --> 0:40:55,060
 I am planning on using,

1092
0:40:55,060 --> 0:40:57,060
 but that's a whole different story,

1093
0:40:57,060 --> 0:40:59,060
 but I'm planning on using an ethanol-based system,

1094
0:40:59,060 --> 0:41:01,060
 because the gas is getting,

1095
0:41:01,060 --> 0:41:03,060
 the prices go really up for the gas,

1096
0:41:03,060 --> 0:41:06,060
 so I'm looking now to build an ethanol-based system,

1097
0:41:06,060 --> 0:41:08,060
 which is using like alcohol,

1098
0:41:08,060 --> 0:41:10,060
 but it's liquid,

1099
0:41:10,060 --> 0:41:14,060
 and then you run into a whole lot of different risks,

1100
0:41:14,060 --> 0:41:16,060
 because it's liquid.

1101
0:41:16,060 --> 0:41:17,060
 If it doesn't ignite,

1102
0:41:17,060 --> 0:41:19,060
 you shoot ethanol in the air.

1103
0:41:19,060 --> 0:41:22,060
 The system I have now in mind and designed

1104
0:41:22,060 --> 0:41:25,060
 only shoots like 15 milliliters of ethanol at 10 bars,

1105
0:41:25,060 --> 0:41:27,060
 so if you shoot it out,

1106
0:41:27,060 --> 0:41:30,060
 it makes it very fine particles,

1107
0:41:30,060 --> 0:41:31,060
 so if you shoot it up,

1108
0:41:31,060 --> 0:41:34,060
 it probably goes 8 to 10 meters up,

1109
0:41:34,060 --> 0:41:38,060
 so then there's less chance of it getting down,

1110
0:41:38,060 --> 0:41:40,060
 but there is some risk involved,

1111
0:41:40,060 --> 0:41:42,060
 and I'm still working out those details,

1112
0:41:42,060 --> 0:41:44,060
 but maybe in the future,

1113
0:41:44,060 --> 0:41:45,060
 I bring another device,

1114
0:41:45,060 --> 0:41:48,060
 and then you can shoot faster,

1115
0:41:48,060 --> 0:41:49,060
 higher,

1116
0:41:49,060 --> 0:41:50,060
 and more,

1117
0:41:50,060 --> 0:41:52,060
 and it's cheaper to use.

1118
0:41:52,060 --> 0:41:54,060
 It's using ethanol,

1119
0:41:54,060 --> 0:41:56,060
 but I'm experimenting with stuff,

1120
0:41:56,060 --> 0:42:01,060
 and I'm also trying to build the first,

1121
0:42:01,060 --> 0:42:03,060
 world's first RGB flamethrower,

1122
0:42:03,060 --> 0:42:05,060
 so with three colors you can mix,

1123
0:42:05,060 --> 0:42:08,060
 so I will dissolve salts in ethanol,

1124
0:42:08,060 --> 0:42:10,060
 and then shoot the flame,

1125
0:42:10,060 --> 0:42:12,060
 so then you can have R, G, and B,

1126
0:42:12,060 --> 0:42:14,060
 and you can have a flame that first turns red,

1127
0:42:14,060 --> 0:42:15,060
 and then turns green,

1128
0:42:15,060 --> 0:42:16,060
 and then turns blue,

1129
0:42:16,060 --> 0:42:18,060
 and I hope to be the first one to make this,

1130
0:42:18,060 --> 0:42:19,060
 but probably saying this

1131
0:42:19,060 --> 0:42:21,060
 will make other people make it faster,

1132
0:42:21,060 --> 0:42:23,060
 so that's my idea,

1133
0:42:23,060 --> 0:42:25,060
 so yes, I have experimented.

1134
0:42:25,060 --> 0:42:27,060
 Does that answer your question?

1135
0:42:31,060 --> 0:42:34,060
 I see that you are using a straight tube as an exit,

1136
0:42:34,060 --> 0:42:37,060
 have you also tried other shapes,

1137
0:42:37,060 --> 0:42:40,060
 other nozzles or fan shapes at the top

1138
0:42:40,060 --> 0:42:42,060
 to make other shaped flames?

1139
0:42:42,060 --> 0:42:46,060
 Yeah, we have tried to go from the tube straight to wider,

1140
0:42:46,060 --> 0:42:49,060
 in some cases it helps,

1141
0:42:49,060 --> 0:42:50,060
 in some cases not,

1142
0:42:50,060 --> 0:42:51,060
 we are still investigating,

1143
0:42:51,060 --> 0:42:54,060
 and we also on the right flamethrower,

1144
0:42:54,060 --> 0:42:56,060
 if you stand in front of the info desk,

1145
0:42:56,060 --> 0:42:58,060
 we put a nozzle that makes it smaller,

1146
0:42:58,060 --> 0:43:01,060
 so we go from three quarters of an inch,

1147
0:43:01,060 --> 0:43:03,060
 to half an inch,

1148
0:43:03,060 --> 0:43:06,060
 and then you will hear it really go whoosh,

1149
0:43:06,060 --> 0:43:08,060
 like some sort of jet engine,

1150
0:43:08,060 --> 0:43:11,060
 and if you go even smaller it starts to whistle,

1151
0:43:11,060 --> 0:43:13,060
 on EMF we also tried the ship's horn,

1152
0:43:13,060 --> 0:43:14,060
 which is really nice,

1153
0:43:14,060 --> 0:43:16,060
 you have a ship's horn and the flames come out,

1154
0:43:16,060 --> 0:43:19,060
 not really exploding really far,

1155
0:43:19,060 --> 0:43:21,060
 but you go whoosh,

1156
0:43:21,060 --> 0:43:23,060
 but people didn't like it at night,

1157
0:43:23,060 --> 0:43:25,060
 because we kept them awake from their sleep,

1158
0:43:25,060 --> 0:43:28,060
 but yes, we have experimented,

1159
0:43:28,060 --> 0:43:32,060
 and one of the other plans I have is to make a bigger vessel,

1160
0:43:32,060 --> 0:43:35,060
 so a bigger bottle with a three inch valve,

1161
0:43:35,060 --> 0:43:38,060
 and then you want to go from the three inch valve

1162
0:43:38,060 --> 0:43:40,060
 to something like five or six inch pipe,

1163
0:43:40,060 --> 0:43:42,060
 and then have the ring in there,

1164
0:43:42,060 --> 0:43:43,060
 the fire ring,

1165
0:43:43,060 --> 0:43:45,060
 so you don't see the pilot flame,

1166
0:43:45,060 --> 0:43:48,060
 and you have a larger expansion of the gas,

1167
0:43:48,060 --> 0:43:50,060
 so you get a bigger column,

1168
0:43:50,060 --> 0:43:54,060
 so hopefully a more intense higher flame,

1169
0:43:54,060 --> 0:43:57,060
 but you can experiment with that,

1170
0:43:57,060 --> 0:43:59,060
 and it's always,

1171
0:43:59,060 --> 0:44:02,060
 the tip here is to go from small to big,

1172
0:44:02,060 --> 0:44:04,060
 it's better than to try and go narrow,

1173
0:44:04,060 --> 0:44:06,060
 to see if you shoot higher,

1174
0:44:06,060 --> 0:44:09,060
 because then you cannot pass the gas fast enough,

1175
0:44:09,060 --> 0:44:11,060
 and then you will burn off a lot of gas,

1176
0:44:11,060 --> 0:44:13,060
 which is unburned,

1177
0:44:13,060 --> 0:44:17,060
 so going from small to wide will make the expansion easier,

1178
0:44:17,060 --> 0:44:19,060
 and will make the ignition easier,

1179
0:44:19,060 --> 0:44:23,060
 but sometimes you end up with fireballs instead of a column of fire,

1180
0:44:23,060 --> 0:44:25,060
 but yes, some people want that,

1181
0:44:25,060 --> 0:44:29,060
 and then you can make like a fireball shoot in the air,

1182
0:44:29,060 --> 0:44:32,060
 so yes, experimenting is really important here,

1183
0:44:32,060 --> 0:44:36,060
 and helps you in defining which shape you like.

1184
0:44:36,060 --> 0:44:40,060
 Yes, any last questions?

1185
0:44:40,060 --> 0:44:43,060
 If there are no more questions,

1186
0:44:43,060 --> 0:44:45,060
 I'm here all camp,

1187
0:44:45,060 --> 0:44:46,060
 again thanks to Borneck

1188
0:44:46,060 --> 0:44:48,060
 for having me on stage here,

1189
0:44:48,060 --> 0:44:49,060
 if you want to ask questions,

1190
0:44:49,060 --> 0:44:51,060
 or tomorrow you think of something,

1191
0:44:51,060 --> 0:44:52,060
 just drop by,

1192
0:44:52,060 --> 0:44:54,060
 at night I'm in front of the info container,

1193
0:44:54,060 --> 0:44:57,060
 I'm 10 meters ahead with a table and a laptop,

1194
0:44:57,060 --> 0:44:58,060
 you can have a go tonight,

1195
0:44:58,060 --> 0:44:59,060
 if you want to play,

1196
0:44:59,060 --> 0:45:01,060
 or want to ask some more questions,

1197
0:45:01,060 --> 0:45:02,060
 and as I said,

1198
0:45:02,060 --> 0:45:04,060
 I can show you backstage,

1199
0:45:04,060 --> 0:45:05,060
 how it's done,

1200
0:45:05,060 --> 0:45:07,060
 and how it all operates,

1201
0:45:07,060 --> 0:45:09,060
 so thank you so much.

1202
0:45:09,060 --> 0:45:10,060
 Thank you.

1203
0:45:16,060 --> 0:45:17,060
 Thank you.
