0:00:00,000 --> 0:00:09,340
 So welcome to almost the last talk of this year,

2
0:00:09,480 --> 0:00:11,920
 and this is the time where Morten gets to brag

3
0:00:11,920 --> 0:00:14,420
 about how well the network has run through the camp.

4
0:00:21,420 --> 0:00:25,600
 So it's nice to see so many people.

5
0:00:25,600 --> 0:00:32,400
 I have added something by request from the NOC team.

6
0:00:33,680 --> 0:00:39,600
 So this is the usual end-of-camp network talk

7
0:00:40,440 --> 0:00:42,560
 where we will go through what we've been doing,

8
0:00:42,800 --> 0:00:45,520
 and we have done all kinds of interesting things,

9
0:00:45,700 --> 0:00:48,720
 and you guys have also, and this is the talk about that.

10
0:00:49,260 --> 0:00:52,700
 So you all know Hypnotoad, right?

11
0:00:54,380 --> 0:00:54,900
 Okay.

12
0:00:54,900 --> 0:00:58,280
 Okay, so first things first, this is the mandatory slide

13
0:00:58,280 --> 0:01:00,520
 about how much bandwidth we've been using,

14
0:01:01,440 --> 0:01:05,980
 and last year I had this recurring thing saying,

15
0:01:06,220 --> 0:01:08,900
 use more bandwidth, and hmm.

16
0:01:11,860 --> 0:01:14,160
 Well, I just skipped that hashtag

17
0:01:14,160 --> 0:01:16,360
 because apparently it's not working to say it.

18
0:01:16,980 --> 0:01:19,900
 So just a quick one on the slides.

19
0:01:24,900 --> 0:01:32,520
 Yes?

20
0:01:33,520 --> 0:01:34,820
 Oh, this is much better.

21
0:01:35,260 --> 0:01:38,300
 Anyway, so what you see is the red line.

22
0:01:38,420 --> 0:01:40,020
 That is 200 megabit.

23
0:01:45,020 --> 0:01:50,240
 I'm, yeah, and I'm pretty sure that the big line here

24
0:01:50,240 --> 0:01:52,160
 is probably someone doing an iPerf

25
0:01:52,160 --> 0:01:54,540
 or maxing out the network or whatever.

26
0:01:54,900 --> 0:01:56,900
 I'm not sure what kind of testing you could do,

27
0:01:56,900 --> 0:01:58,900
 but when I look at this slide, I'm thinking,

28
0:01:58,900 --> 0:02:01,900
 I'm going to have a hard time convincing Orca

29
0:02:01,900 --> 0:02:04,900
 to give us three gigabit next year, or five, or 10.

30
0:02:04,900 --> 0:02:07,900
 So we kind of need to do some design changes

31
0:02:07,900 --> 0:02:10,900
 in order to use massive amounts of bandwidth

32
0:02:10,900 --> 0:02:12,900
 because we, of course, all like bandwidth.

33
0:02:12,900 --> 0:02:15,900
 It's just not something we use, but we like it.

34
0:02:20,400 --> 0:02:23,400
 So I have divided this talk into two parts.

35
0:02:23,400 --> 0:02:24,360
 All the core stuff.

36
0:02:24,360 --> 0:02:25,360
 And all the non-core stuff.

37
0:02:25,360 --> 0:02:31,360
 So just to give you a bit of agenda for this.

38
0:02:31,360 --> 0:02:35,360
 So we, of course, started, as we always do, in the weekend.

39
0:02:35,360 --> 0:02:39,360
 And we start looking at all the stuff we have.

40
0:02:39,360 --> 0:02:41,360
 And there have been a lot of switches and stuff

41
0:02:41,360 --> 0:02:45,360
 that we brought, we being my team, not me.

42
0:02:45,360 --> 0:02:48,360
 And then Sunday, or was it Saturday?

43
0:02:48,360 --> 0:02:49,360
 Oh, it was Saturday.

44
0:02:49,360 --> 0:02:54,360
 Yay, now we have the fiber link, you know, the converter from,

45
0:02:54,360 --> 0:02:57,360
 MX to LC, you know, if you were here last year,

46
0:02:57,360 --> 0:03:00,360
 you probably remember me talking about MX connectors.

47
0:03:00,360 --> 0:03:02,360
 Nobody uses that except broadcast people,

48
0:03:02,360 --> 0:03:05,360
 so of course nobody has that in stock.

49
0:03:05,360 --> 0:03:10,360
 But this year, we were well prepared.

50
0:03:10,360 --> 0:03:14,360
 And the thing that happened was that,

51
0:03:14,360 --> 0:03:19,360
 Asbjorn, he brought the MX to LC converter,

52
0:03:19,360 --> 0:03:21,360
 and there was an MX thing in the well.

53
0:03:21,360 --> 0:03:23,360
 So what's the problem?

54
0:03:23,360 --> 0:03:27,360
 Well, of course, then some bright person said,

55
0:03:27,360 --> 0:03:31,360
 Didn't we have two cables last year?

56
0:03:31,360 --> 0:03:35,360
 The thing that happened was that, if you see here,

57
0:03:35,360 --> 0:03:38,360
 this is a connector with a flange,

58
0:03:38,360 --> 0:03:42,360
 which is, you know, for built-in to equipment.

59
0:03:42,360 --> 0:03:45,360
 And this here is the thing for the connector cables.

60
0:03:45,360 --> 0:03:48,360
 So we had two of those.

61
0:03:48,360 --> 0:03:51,360
 Wonderful.

62
0:03:51,360 --> 0:03:52,360
 So.

63
0:03:52,360 --> 0:03:57,360
 So we, well, I went through my phone book

64
0:03:57,360 --> 0:04:01,360
 to find broadcast people who actually had some of this stuff,

65
0:04:01,360 --> 0:04:04,360
 but all of them had gone to Le Mans

66
0:04:04,360 --> 0:04:06,360
 and some place in Jutland,

67
0:04:06,360 --> 0:04:08,360
 so my connections were no good,

68
0:04:08,360 --> 0:04:13,360
 but we acquired one in a proper connector cable during Saturday.

69
0:04:13,360 --> 0:04:17,360
 But before that, we actually punched a hole through,

70
0:04:17,360 --> 0:04:20,360
 which I think is immensely super nice.

71
0:04:20,360 --> 0:04:21,360
 So.

72
0:04:21,360 --> 0:04:25,360
 So this is apparently a picture we're going to do every year,

73
0:04:25,360 --> 0:04:26,360
 because I like this.

74
0:04:26,360 --> 0:04:30,360
 This is the uplink, and we have light.

75
0:04:30,360 --> 0:04:33,360
 Awesome.

76
0:04:33,360 --> 0:04:36,360
 As I said, we were short of cable.

77
0:04:36,360 --> 0:04:41,360
 So how do you fix that when you work with light?

78
0:04:41,360 --> 0:04:42,360
 Yes.

79
0:04:42,360 --> 0:04:47,360
 We used scotch in order to have the two flange ends meet up

80
0:04:47,360 --> 0:04:50,360
 so that we could actually test if we had a connection,

81
0:04:50,360 --> 0:04:55,360
 which worked well.

82
0:04:55,360 --> 0:04:57,360
 Actually, it worked well.

83
0:04:57,360 --> 0:04:59,360
 It was just that, you know,

84
0:04:59,360 --> 0:05:02,360
 shouldn't be too windy or anyone touching it,

85
0:05:02,360 --> 0:05:04,360
 because, you know, light and, you know,

86
0:05:04,360 --> 0:05:06,360
 different angles would not be a good thing.

87
0:05:06,360 --> 0:05:07,360
 So.

88
0:05:07,360 --> 0:05:13,360
 But we actually had light through the equipment on Saturday.

89
0:05:13,360 --> 0:05:18,360
 This was quick.

90
0:05:18,360 --> 0:05:19,360
 So.

91
0:05:19,360 --> 0:05:23,360
 We, of course, ran into other issues,

92
0:05:23,360 --> 0:05:26,360
 because, you know, this is BornHack,

93
0:05:26,360 --> 0:05:30,360
 and what would networking be without extra issues?

94
0:05:30,360 --> 0:05:32,360
 This one was a new one.

95
0:05:32,360 --> 0:05:34,360
 You know, we planned for a lot of things.

96
0:05:34,360 --> 0:05:36,360
 We bring a lot of equipment and, you know, spare fibers,

97
0:05:36,360 --> 0:05:37,360
 all kinds of stuff.

98
0:05:37,360 --> 0:05:41,360
 And what we hadn't planned for was a beautiful red digger

99
0:05:41,360 --> 0:05:43,360
 next to the well.

100
0:05:43,360 --> 0:05:47,360
 So, well, I don't know how to say this,

101
0:05:47,360 --> 0:05:48,360
 but you see this.

102
0:05:48,360 --> 0:05:50,360
 But you see the red digger.

103
0:05:50,360 --> 0:05:53,360
 This is...

104
0:05:53,360 --> 0:05:57,360
 This one here is our pole, you know,

105
0:05:57,360 --> 0:05:59,360
 for the crossing road.

106
0:05:59,360 --> 0:06:02,360
 And we have this nice, large digger next to it.

107
0:06:02,360 --> 0:06:07,360
 And it's just the strings we attach in order to make the pole

108
0:06:07,360 --> 0:06:11,360
 not fall over was actually going across the digger.

109
0:06:11,360 --> 0:06:17,360
 So we kind of, you know, this might be an issue, you know.

110
0:06:17,360 --> 0:06:21,360
 And so I wrote this nice thing and put it in the windscreen

111
0:06:21,360 --> 0:06:25,360
 with some of the BornHack flabber tape.

112
0:06:25,360 --> 0:06:27,360
 Flabber?

113
0:06:27,360 --> 0:06:28,360
 Flatterband.

114
0:06:28,360 --> 0:06:29,360
 Flatterband.

115
0:06:29,360 --> 0:06:30,360
 I'm learning Dutch.

116
0:06:30,360 --> 0:06:33,360
 With some Flatterband and wrote that,

117
0:06:33,360 --> 0:06:35,360
 hey, please take care of our fiber.

118
0:06:35,360 --> 0:06:39,360
 And the guy, he called Monday morning.

119
0:06:39,360 --> 0:06:40,360
 I was not here.

120
0:06:40,360 --> 0:06:44,360
 We were all, you know, planned for the worst,

121
0:06:44,360 --> 0:06:45,360
 hoped for the best situation.

122
0:06:45,360 --> 0:06:46,360
 It could have been worse.

123
0:06:46,360 --> 0:06:49,360
 It could have been some idiot driving this thing

124
0:06:49,360 --> 0:06:53,360
 and complete no-brainer start digging everywhere.

125
0:06:53,360 --> 0:07:00,360
 But it turned out to be a nice guy who was super helpful.

126
0:07:00,360 --> 0:07:05,360
 And we had some...

127
0:07:05,360 --> 0:07:07,360
 We had some help building this.

128
0:07:07,360 --> 0:07:09,360
 Actually, I've inverted these two slides.

129
0:07:09,360 --> 0:07:11,360
 Let's do the next one.

130
0:07:11,360 --> 0:07:13,360
 So we had this guy.

131
0:07:13,360 --> 0:07:14,360
 We actually installed

132
0:07:14,360 --> 0:07:19,360
 an extra little tube going from our well to the fence.

133
0:07:19,360 --> 0:07:20,360
 So...

134
0:07:20,360 --> 0:07:21,360
 And then move the pole.

135
0:07:21,360 --> 0:07:24,360
 And he was helpful doing that with us.

136
0:07:24,360 --> 0:07:26,360
 And then we have our two...

137
0:07:26,360 --> 0:07:28,360
 These are not publicly employed.

138
0:07:28,360 --> 0:07:30,360
 These are from the network team.

139
0:07:30,360 --> 0:07:32,360
 You see, we have this...

140
0:07:32,360 --> 0:07:33,360
 I'm the manager.

141
0:07:33,360 --> 0:07:34,360
 I don't do much.

142
0:07:34,360 --> 0:07:35,360
 And then we have our supervisor.

143
0:07:35,360 --> 0:07:38,360
 And then we have the techie people doing the work, right?

144
0:07:38,360 --> 0:07:40,360
 This is moral support.

145
0:07:40,360 --> 0:07:41,360
 I've heard that is super important

146
0:07:41,360 --> 0:07:43,360
 so you don't feel alone when you work hard.

147
0:07:44,360 --> 0:07:46,360
 Yes.

148
0:07:46,360 --> 0:07:49,360
 And, of course, we have tried to anonymize them

149
0:07:49,360 --> 0:07:50,360
 so that...

150
0:07:50,360 --> 0:07:53,360
 To protect the innocent and such.

151
0:07:53,360 --> 0:07:58,360
 Anyway, I just wanted to show you this one where I...

152
0:07:58,360 --> 0:08:01,360
 This is how it looks yesterday.

153
0:08:01,360 --> 0:08:05,360
 I tried to bake a panoramic view of this.

154
0:08:05,360 --> 0:08:08,360
 And you see there's a big hole here.

155
0:08:08,360 --> 0:08:11,360
 We have our well here.

156
0:08:11,360 --> 0:08:12,360
 And then there's a big hole on the other side.

157
0:08:12,360 --> 0:08:13,360
 So there's a big hole.

158
0:08:13,360 --> 0:08:19,360
 Two meters including our well and a big hole on the other side.

159
0:08:19,360 --> 0:08:24,360
 And it was also there that they, you know, killed the water pipe earlier.

160
0:08:24,360 --> 0:08:25,360
 But they were nice.

161
0:08:25,360 --> 0:08:28,360
 They killed the water, not our fiber.

162
0:08:28,360 --> 0:08:30,360
 We like that.

163
0:08:30,360 --> 0:08:33,360
 So sensible people kill water, not our fiber,

164
0:08:33,360 --> 0:08:35,360
 because that would have been problematic.

165
0:08:35,360 --> 0:08:37,360
 Who wants a fiber cut?

166
0:08:37,360 --> 0:08:39,360
 But he was really nice, that guy.

167
0:08:39,360 --> 0:08:41,360
 And he got two packets of Stroopwafel.

168
0:08:41,360 --> 0:08:44,360
 And so that worked.

169
0:08:44,360 --> 0:08:46,360
 And this is...

170
0:08:46,360 --> 0:08:50,360
 This just makes me happy when you meet people who are sensible,

171
0:08:50,360 --> 0:08:55,360
 who just find solutions to crap problems that none of us have invented

172
0:08:55,360 --> 0:08:59,360
 and you just ram into them.

173
0:08:59,360 --> 0:09:03,360
 And this is the kind of problems that since we actually were well prepared,

174
0:09:03,360 --> 0:09:07,360
 we had actually configured all the switches and stuff in advance,

175
0:09:07,360 --> 0:09:08,360
 we can...

176
0:09:08,360 --> 0:09:10,360
 I think that when you do good planning,

177
0:09:10,360 --> 0:09:12,360
 and are well prepared,

178
0:09:12,360 --> 0:09:15,360
 you have capacity to handle...

179
0:09:15,360 --> 0:09:17,360
 Yeah, who foresaw this one?

180
0:09:17,360 --> 0:09:21,360
 It might be in some book at the municipality that they're going to dig now,

181
0:09:21,360 --> 0:09:24,360
 but I'm not going to look into that one.

182
0:09:24,360 --> 0:09:26,360
 I don't even know where to find it.

183
0:09:26,360 --> 0:09:29,360
 So a lot of crap will appear, and they will have a lot of problems.

184
0:09:29,360 --> 0:09:32,360
 We also had this issue with all our knock equipment

185
0:09:32,360 --> 0:09:35,360
 being at the furthest end of the container.

186
0:09:35,360 --> 0:09:38,360
 So power cables for the switches and such,

187
0:09:38,360 --> 0:09:39,360
 it's...

188
0:09:39,360 --> 0:09:42,360
 It's not something that the Dutch people have

189
0:09:42,360 --> 0:09:44,360
 that brings most of the equipment.

190
0:09:44,360 --> 0:09:46,360
 They use, you know, Schuko,

191
0:09:46,360 --> 0:09:48,360
 which is not what we use in Denmark,

192
0:09:48,360 --> 0:09:52,360
 because safety, monopoly...

193
0:09:52,360 --> 0:09:55,360
 I don't know why we use these three-legged things.

194
0:09:55,360 --> 0:09:57,360
 So, but that was foreseen.

195
0:09:57,360 --> 0:10:01,360
 We actually bought an extra box from my home I have spare,

196
0:10:01,360 --> 0:10:03,360
 because then we could get started.

197
0:10:03,360 --> 0:10:05,360
 This is planning to make stuff easier,

198
0:10:05,360 --> 0:10:08,360
 and then we have capacity to handle weird shit,

199
0:10:08,360 --> 0:10:11,360
 which always happens for some reason.

200
0:10:11,360 --> 0:10:14,360
 Okay, so the end result of this

201
0:10:14,360 --> 0:10:20,360
 was that we actually got this light through.

202
0:10:20,360 --> 0:10:23,360
 So when you build something like this,

203
0:10:23,360 --> 0:10:26,360
 we know that as soon as possible,

204
0:10:26,360 --> 0:10:29,360
 we want to know if we have a light going through

205
0:10:29,360 --> 0:10:34,360
 from our end to the data center in Gilstedt.

206
0:10:34,360 --> 0:10:36,360
 Because that means that we have layer one up and running.

207
0:10:36,360 --> 0:10:37,360
 We have, you know,

208
0:10:37,360 --> 0:10:40,360
 stuff has been configured-ish, right?

209
0:10:40,360 --> 0:10:42,360
 And when you have layer one up and running,

210
0:10:42,360 --> 0:10:44,360
 you want to have layer three up and running also.

211
0:10:44,360 --> 0:10:47,360
 And of course, there was some configuration issue

212
0:10:47,360 --> 0:10:50,360
 so that we didn't have layer three at once.

213
0:10:50,360 --> 0:10:51,360
 That's fine.

214
0:10:51,360 --> 0:10:52,360
 That happens every year

215
0:10:52,360 --> 0:10:54,360
 that we have some non-standard configuration,

216
0:10:54,360 --> 0:10:57,360
 and our provider kind of forgets something.

217
0:10:57,360 --> 0:11:00,360
 So we call them, and we know that this happens.

218
0:11:00,360 --> 0:11:03,360
 But what happened, this born hack was

219
0:11:03,360 --> 0:11:06,360
 that we actually had internet up and running

220
0:11:06,360 --> 0:11:08,360
 since Monday afternoon.

221
0:11:08,360 --> 0:11:10,360
 I think that is super cool,

222
0:11:10,360 --> 0:11:14,360
 and I think the network team should get an applause for that.

223
0:11:24,360 --> 0:11:29,360
 Okay, we continue as always.

224
0:11:29,360 --> 0:11:34,360
 This is one of those marketing pictures

225
0:11:34,360 --> 0:11:38,360
 where this is after we cleaned up.

226
0:11:38,360 --> 0:11:40,360
 It didn't look like that all the time,

227
0:11:40,360 --> 0:11:42,360
 but now it looks nice and clean, right?

228
0:11:42,360 --> 0:11:44,360
 It also helps with other things,

229
0:11:44,360 --> 0:11:46,360
 like finding the right cables and such.

230
0:11:46,360 --> 0:11:48,360
 But this is our server room.

231
0:11:48,360 --> 0:11:50,360
 We actually have room to move now.

232
0:11:50,360 --> 0:11:52,360
 We kind of move all the firefighting equipment elsewhere.

233
0:11:52,360 --> 0:11:54,360
 I think that's a super nice idea.

234
0:11:54,360 --> 0:11:56,360
 We're going to do that next year also.

235
0:11:56,360 --> 0:11:58,360
 And then you have all our equipment.

236
0:11:58,360 --> 0:12:01,360
 We have our Nox server,

237
0:12:01,360 --> 0:12:04,360
 which runs virtual machines,

238
0:12:04,360 --> 0:12:06,360
 for DSCP and DNS,

239
0:12:06,360 --> 0:12:08,360
 and what's the third one?

240
0:12:08,360 --> 0:12:11,360
 And we have some equipment in the stack,

241
0:12:11,360 --> 0:12:13,360
 which is the core switches,

242
0:12:13,360 --> 0:12:15,360
 the wireless controller,

243
0:12:15,360 --> 0:12:20,360
 and this year we also had an extra virtual machine host.

244
0:12:20,360 --> 0:12:22,360
 We have another server.

245
0:12:22,360 --> 0:12:24,360
 And then we have all the cables coming in and out.

246
0:12:24,360 --> 0:12:26,360
 And that's a nice setup.

247
0:12:26,360 --> 0:12:30,360
 One of the designs that we use here

248
0:12:30,360 --> 0:12:33,360
 that is different from most places

249
0:12:33,360 --> 0:12:38,360
 is that we really don't want your data.

250
0:12:38,360 --> 0:12:42,360
 We want to make an effort in preserving your privacy,

251
0:12:42,360 --> 0:12:46,360
 and that includes turning off a lot of logging on these devices,

252
0:12:46,360 --> 0:12:49,360
 and when we leave, we are going to wipe the servers.

253
0:12:49,360 --> 0:12:51,360
 That's just how it works,

254
0:12:51,360 --> 0:12:53,360
 so that we will not have your MAC addresses.

255
0:12:53,360 --> 0:12:56,360
 We will not know when you went from one tent to the other.

256
0:12:56,360 --> 0:12:58,360
 You know, normal wireless systems,

257
0:12:58,360 --> 0:13:00,360
 they can track you by MAC address

258
0:13:00,360 --> 0:13:02,360
 when you move from AP to AP and such.

259
0:13:02,360 --> 0:13:06,360
 And all this DNS stuff and so on.

260
0:13:06,360 --> 0:13:08,360
 This is simply not something we log.

261
0:13:08,360 --> 0:13:10,360
 And now, when we are done here,

262
0:13:10,360 --> 0:13:12,360
 we are going to wipe the servers,

263
0:13:12,360 --> 0:13:14,360
 as we always do.

264
0:13:20,360 --> 0:13:21,360
 Yes.

265
0:13:21,360 --> 0:13:24,360
 So this was a little view into our R31,

266
0:13:24,360 --> 0:13:26,360
 our server room.

267
0:13:26,360 --> 0:13:27,360
 It's not the toilet.

268
0:13:27,360 --> 0:13:29,360
 It's the one between the toilets.

269
0:13:29,360 --> 0:13:31,360
 Just saying.

270
0:13:31,360 --> 0:13:34,360
 Yes.

271
0:13:34,360 --> 0:13:37,360
 Okay.

272
0:13:37,360 --> 0:13:41,360
 We use a bit of fiber on field.

273
0:13:41,360 --> 0:13:44,360
 What you see here is me and my phone

274
0:13:44,360 --> 0:13:46,360
 going for a walk.

275
0:13:46,360 --> 0:13:48,360
 A long walk.

276
0:13:48,360 --> 0:13:50,360
 And for some reason,

277
0:13:50,360 --> 0:13:53,360
 somebody decided to put them through the nettles,

278
0:13:53,360 --> 0:13:55,360
 so that I, you know,

279
0:13:55,360 --> 0:13:57,360
 it's wonderful, you know.

280
0:13:57,360 --> 0:13:59,360
 Might have an issue with that, just saying.

281
0:13:59,360 --> 0:14:00,360
 Okay.

282
0:14:00,360 --> 0:14:02,360
 But the interesting part here is that

283
0:14:02,360 --> 0:14:04,360
 we have kilometers of fiber.

284
0:14:04,360 --> 0:14:06,360
 And you can see this design we have

285
0:14:06,360 --> 0:14:08,360
 where we, you know,

286
0:14:08,360 --> 0:14:10,360
 this looks like a standard star topology.

287
0:14:10,360 --> 0:14:12,360
 No, actually, it doesn't.

288
0:14:12,360 --> 0:14:13,360
 But it is.

289
0:14:13,360 --> 0:14:16,360
 So we have R31 here

290
0:14:16,360 --> 0:14:18,360
 in the middle of everything.

291
0:14:18,360 --> 0:14:20,360
 Oh, I forgot Noisy on this one.

292
0:14:20,360 --> 0:14:21,360
 Noisy is over here.

293
0:14:21,360 --> 0:14:23,360
 I have that one stuck also.

294
0:14:23,360 --> 0:14:25,360
 So...

295
0:14:25,360 --> 0:14:27,360
 Cute.

296
0:14:27,360 --> 0:14:28,360
 So we have a fiber going,

297
0:14:28,360 --> 0:14:31,360
 we have a distribution point next to R31,

298
0:14:31,360 --> 0:14:33,360
 and we have fibers coming in and out.

299
0:14:33,360 --> 0:14:35,360
 And what you can do with fiber,

300
0:14:35,360 --> 0:14:37,360
 which is super cool,

301
0:14:37,360 --> 0:14:39,360
 is that you can make passive connections.

302
0:14:39,360 --> 0:14:42,360
 So what you have from all the way up to the well,

303
0:14:42,360 --> 0:14:44,360
 through campsite,

304
0:14:44,360 --> 0:14:46,360
 through down into R31,

305
0:14:46,360 --> 0:14:49,360
 we have a passive connection for the fiber,

306
0:14:49,360 --> 0:14:52,360
 which means that if power drops everywhere else

307
0:14:52,360 --> 0:14:54,360
 than in data centers,

308
0:14:54,360 --> 0:14:56,360
 we have a passive connection for the fiber,

309
0:14:56,360 --> 0:14:59,360
 where else than in data center Gilsted

310
0:14:59,360 --> 0:15:03,360
 or data center R31,

311
0:15:03,360 --> 0:15:07,360
 then we actually still maintain internet connection.

312
0:15:07,360 --> 0:15:09,360
 And it means that when you are on site,

313
0:15:09,360 --> 0:15:10,360
 like imagine you have,

314
0:15:10,360 --> 0:15:12,360
 you are in the general camping,

315
0:15:12,360 --> 0:15:16,360
 and there for some reason is power outage

316
0:15:16,360 --> 0:15:18,360
 in different places,

317
0:15:18,360 --> 0:15:21,360
 you are actually not affecting the other areas.

318
0:15:21,360 --> 0:15:24,360
 And that is a super nice feature of this,

319
0:15:24,360 --> 0:15:26,360
 of these fibers.

320
0:15:26,360 --> 0:15:28,360
 So we have fibers with two cores,

321
0:15:28,360 --> 0:15:29,360
 we have fibers with eight cores,

322
0:15:29,360 --> 0:15:30,360
 four, twelve,

323
0:15:30,360 --> 0:15:32,360
 I don't remember the numbers,

324
0:15:32,360 --> 0:15:34,360
 but one like the one that crosses the road

325
0:15:34,360 --> 0:15:37,360
 from R31 to our distribution point,

326
0:15:37,360 --> 0:15:39,360
 it's a twelve core thingy.

327
0:15:39,360 --> 0:15:43,360
 And it just means that we have a different site

328
0:15:43,360 --> 0:15:47,360
 or different area per fiber,

329
0:15:47,360 --> 0:15:50,360
 and that's actually quite nice.

330
0:15:50,360 --> 0:15:53,360
 This is something we have been discussing,

331
0:15:53,360 --> 0:15:55,360
 because I'm always doing this,

332
0:15:55,360 --> 0:15:59,360
 I'm always doing this stupid drunk guy scenario,

333
0:15:59,360 --> 0:16:03,360
 and it turns out that the stupid drunk guy

334
0:16:03,360 --> 0:16:07,360
 is not someone who touches our network at Bonehack.

335
0:16:07,360 --> 0:16:10,360
 And it's really nice to be around people

336
0:16:10,360 --> 0:16:12,360
 who treat our equipment nice,

337
0:16:12,360 --> 0:16:14,360
 and you know, play along,

338
0:16:14,360 --> 0:16:16,360
 because otherwise we really should have

339
0:16:16,360 --> 0:16:18,360
 insane amounts of protection

340
0:16:18,360 --> 0:16:20,360
 and ensure that everything is super armored

341
0:16:20,360 --> 0:16:22,360
 and locked down and all kinds of stuff

342
0:16:22,360 --> 0:16:24,360
 that we don't want to spend our time doing.

343
0:16:24,360 --> 0:16:27,360
 So you treat our equipment well,

344
0:16:27,360 --> 0:16:29,360
 and that's all we can ask for.

345
0:16:29,360 --> 0:16:31,360
 So thank you for that.

346
0:16:34,360 --> 0:16:36,360
 These fibers, yes,

347
0:16:36,360 --> 0:16:40,360
 some people have them under their pillow or something,

348
0:16:40,360 --> 0:16:42,360
 we borrow some left and right.

349
0:16:42,360 --> 0:16:45,360
 Actually, the 2.4 kilometers,

350
0:16:45,360 --> 0:16:49,360
 I don't think they include the 300 meters from Kamsa,

351
0:16:49,360 --> 0:16:51,360
 so it's actually more we have.

352
0:16:51,360 --> 0:16:53,360
 But we still have a bit in spare,

353
0:16:53,360 --> 0:16:55,360
 so we, of course, have not abused,

354
0:16:55,360 --> 0:16:57,360
 only used a bit more than 2 kilometers.

355
0:16:57,360 --> 0:16:59,360
 Why not?

356
0:16:59,360 --> 0:17:03,360
 And all this stuff, we get it from Event Infra.

357
0:17:03,360 --> 0:17:07,360
 Event Infra is an organization in Holland

358
0:17:07,360 --> 0:17:11,360
 that just has a lot of equipment.

359
0:17:11,360 --> 0:17:13,360
 And now we're back to the good part

360
0:17:13,360 --> 0:17:15,360
 about doing Bonehack during Corona.

361
0:17:15,360 --> 0:17:18,360
 There are not other hacker camps.

362
0:17:18,360 --> 0:17:20,360
 Which means, like last year, we can just say,

363
0:17:20,360 --> 0:17:21,360
 two of those, three of those, one of those,

364
0:17:21,360 --> 0:17:22,360
 oh, that was good.

365
0:17:22,360 --> 0:17:25,360
 And then just pick and choose, right?

366
0:17:25,360 --> 0:17:27,360
 And that's really cool.

367
0:17:27,360 --> 0:17:32,360
 And we might need to do a bit more detailed planning

368
0:17:32,360 --> 0:17:35,360
 and borrow a bit less in the coming years

369
0:17:35,360 --> 0:17:38,360
 if there are other hacker camps.

370
0:17:38,360 --> 0:17:41,360
 So that's actually one of the reasons

371
0:17:41,360 --> 0:17:45,360
 why I do this fairly detailed map

372
0:17:45,360 --> 0:17:47,360
 about where stuff is with GPS

373
0:17:47,360 --> 0:17:49,360
 and, you know, which cable we use for where.

374
0:17:49,360 --> 0:17:50,360
 Because when we get press,

375
0:17:50,360 --> 0:17:53,360
 on the equipment,

376
0:17:53,360 --> 0:17:56,360
 we want to know in fairly great detail

377
0:17:56,360 --> 0:17:59,360
 where stuff was so that we can, you know,

378
0:17:59,360 --> 0:18:01,360
 do a more minimal solution than this thing

379
0:18:01,360 --> 0:18:03,360
 where we can just, you know,

380
0:18:03,360 --> 0:18:05,360
 oh, 100 meters, that's fine.

381
0:18:05,360 --> 0:18:07,360
 Here you have a 200 meter cable.

382
0:18:07,360 --> 0:18:09,360
 That's not going to be as easy

383
0:18:09,360 --> 0:18:14,360
 if we cannot borrow all we want.

384
0:18:14,360 --> 0:18:17,360
 Bonehack actually has very little fiber,

385
0:18:17,360 --> 0:18:19,360
 if any.

386
0:18:19,360 --> 0:18:21,360
 Do we have any fiber?

387
0:18:21,360 --> 0:18:22,360
 I don't think so.

388
0:18:22,360 --> 0:18:24,360
 We have a couple of hundred meters.

389
0:18:24,360 --> 0:18:25,360
 Bonehackers?

390
0:18:25,360 --> 0:18:27,360
 Yeah, we have at least 350 meters.

391
0:18:27,360 --> 0:18:28,360
 Awesome.

392
0:18:28,360 --> 0:18:31,360
 And you broke yours last year, yourself.

393
0:18:35,360 --> 0:18:37,360
 I'm glad that we don't have a microphone

394
0:18:37,360 --> 0:18:40,360
 in the audience, with the audience.

395
0:18:42,360 --> 0:18:45,360
 Some people might say slander.

396
0:18:45,360 --> 0:18:49,360
 But the point is that this will simply not happen

397
0:18:49,360 --> 0:18:51,360
 without being able to borrow

398
0:18:51,360 --> 0:18:54,360
 ridiculous amounts of stuff from somewhere.

399
0:18:54,360 --> 0:18:57,360
 This is not something that we ever want to buy.

400
0:18:57,360 --> 0:18:59,360
 This is to use for a week.

401
0:18:59,360 --> 0:19:01,360
 Well, I don't know, maybe you can rent it,

402
0:19:01,360 --> 0:19:04,360
 but that would also be very expensive.

403
0:19:04,360 --> 0:19:06,360
 So, sorry?

404
0:19:06,360 --> 0:19:07,360
 No, sorry.

405
0:19:07,360 --> 0:19:09,360
 One of the things that we have been discussing,

406
0:19:09,360 --> 0:19:12,360
 which we have kind of shelved for now,

407
0:19:12,360 --> 0:19:14,360
 is talking to Juniper

408
0:19:14,360 --> 0:19:17,360
 and have them deliver everything we point at.

409
0:19:17,360 --> 0:19:19,360
 But we don't want that.

410
0:19:19,360 --> 0:19:23,360
 We don't want to draw that card before we actually know

411
0:19:23,360 --> 0:19:25,360
 that everything is going to be peachy

412
0:19:25,360 --> 0:19:27,360
 and corona is kind of settled.

413
0:19:27,360 --> 0:19:31,360
 So, this would be one way of handling some of the equipment.

414
0:19:31,360 --> 0:19:34,360
 It's much easier for us to have a lot of the same equipment,

415
0:19:34,360 --> 0:19:37,360
 but, well, we are pros,

416
0:19:37,360 --> 0:19:39,360
 so it might not be necessary.

417
0:19:39,360 --> 0:19:42,360
 It's just way easier.

418
0:19:42,360 --> 0:19:43,360
 Okay.

419
0:19:43,360 --> 0:19:46,360
 So, I just want to send a lot of love to Event Infra

420
0:19:46,360 --> 0:19:48,360
 and say thank you.

421
0:19:48,360 --> 0:19:50,360
 Do give them an applause.

422
0:19:58,360 --> 0:19:59,360
 Yes.

423
0:19:59,360 --> 0:20:01,360
 So, when the Dutch people arrive,

424
0:20:01,360 --> 0:20:03,360
 they have their cars packed.

425
0:20:03,360 --> 0:20:05,360
 And it's just very cool to see,

426
0:20:05,360 --> 0:20:07,360
 and perhaps you should, you know,

427
0:20:07,360 --> 0:20:09,360
 rent something bigger next year.

428
0:20:09,360 --> 0:20:11,360
 Let's see what happens.

429
0:20:11,360 --> 0:20:12,360
 Okay.

430
0:20:12,360 --> 0:20:15,360
 That was what I wanted to say about our core functionality.

431
0:20:15,360 --> 0:20:16,360
 The non-core stuff,

432
0:20:16,360 --> 0:20:18,360
 we have a lot of,

433
0:20:18,360 --> 0:20:20,360
 a lot of stuff that if it breaks,

434
0:20:20,360 --> 0:20:25,360
 it's, well, doesn't affect everybody,

435
0:20:25,360 --> 0:20:27,360
 only a lot of people.

436
0:20:27,360 --> 0:20:32,360
 So, what we have done is that we have set up 24 access points.

437
0:20:32,360 --> 0:20:36,360
 And just take note,

438
0:20:36,360 --> 0:20:40,360
 because this is going to be on Jevity next year.

439
0:20:40,360 --> 0:20:44,360
 So, how many access points were connected to CAMP in 2021?

440
0:20:44,360 --> 0:20:46,360
 23.

441
0:20:46,360 --> 0:20:47,360
 What is?

442
0:20:48,360 --> 0:20:53,360
 I said to the camping.

443
0:20:53,360 --> 0:20:55,360
 So, the idea is that,

444
0:20:55,360 --> 0:20:57,360
 well, this is our internal documentation,

445
0:20:57,360 --> 0:21:00,360
 which we are going to put somewhere sensible.

446
0:21:00,360 --> 0:21:04,360
 But we have put a lot in different places.

447
0:21:04,360 --> 0:21:06,360
 And actually,

448
0:21:06,360 --> 0:21:10,360
 I didn't know we had a location called Hammock Hill.

449
0:21:10,360 --> 0:21:13,360
 I find that to be a super cool name.

450
0:21:13,360 --> 0:21:16,360
 So, I went on a field trip to find it.

451
0:21:16,360 --> 0:21:18,360
 I didn't,

452
0:21:18,360 --> 0:21:21,360
 I just knew that there were three access points in the bar.

453
0:21:21,360 --> 0:21:23,360
 I forgot to read our documentation.

454
0:21:23,360 --> 0:21:25,360
 So, it was very difficult to find.

455
0:21:25,360 --> 0:21:26,360
 But Hammock Hill,

456
0:21:26,360 --> 0:21:29,360
 the hill part was correct.

457
0:21:29,360 --> 0:21:32,360
 And apparently,

458
0:21:32,360 --> 0:21:35,360
 my guess is that this one,

459
0:21:35,360 --> 0:21:38,360
 the end of CAMP is the last one to be taken down.

460
0:21:38,360 --> 0:21:39,360
 I don't know.

461
0:21:39,360 --> 0:21:41,360
 Maybe.

462
0:21:41,360 --> 0:21:43,360
 No.

463
0:21:43,360 --> 0:21:45,360
 So, and then another interesting detail

464
0:21:45,360 --> 0:21:47,360
 is that the information disk,

465
0:21:47,360 --> 0:21:50,360
 they have their own access point.

466
0:21:50,360 --> 0:21:52,360
 It's because, you know,

467
0:21:52,360 --> 0:21:54,360
 a big metal container

468
0:21:54,360 --> 0:21:58,360
 is not really good for wireless traffic.

469
0:21:58,360 --> 0:22:03,360
 So, we have an access point just outside the information disk,

470
0:22:03,360 --> 0:22:05,360
 but it still doesn't penetrate.

471
0:22:05,360 --> 0:22:07,360
 And that's very cool to just,

472
0:22:07,360 --> 0:22:10,360
 so they have had their access point.

473
0:22:10,360 --> 0:22:14,360
 Yes.

474
0:22:14,360 --> 0:22:19,360
 The APs were of course used.

475
0:22:19,360 --> 0:22:22,360
 And as you can see,

476
0:22:22,360 --> 0:22:24,360
 apparently we have a day-night cycle.

477
0:22:24,360 --> 0:22:27,360
 And I didn't check,

478
0:22:27,360 --> 0:22:31,360
 but nighttime is,

479
0:22:31,360 --> 0:22:36,360
 I don't think you guys go to bed at midnight.

480
0:22:36,360 --> 0:22:38,360
 And we had some issues.

481
0:22:38,360 --> 0:22:40,360
 We have one over there which is,

482
0:22:40,360 --> 0:22:41,360
 who knows,

483
0:22:41,360 --> 0:22:43,360
 and we have a dropout

484
0:22:43,360 --> 0:22:45,360
 in the collection.

485
0:22:45,360 --> 0:22:46,360
 But otherwise,

486
0:22:46,360 --> 0:22:48,360
 this is a graph that looks as we expect.

487
0:22:48,360 --> 0:22:49,360
 So.

488
0:22:49,360 --> 0:22:54,360
 What's the max?

489
0:22:54,360 --> 0:22:55,360
 Huh, good question.

490
0:22:55,360 --> 0:22:56,360
 Two seconds.

491
0:22:56,360 --> 0:22:58,360
 305.

492
0:22:58,360 --> 0:23:02,360
 305.

493
0:23:02,360 --> 0:23:04,360
 I remember last year's average

494
0:23:04,360 --> 0:23:07,360
 was 1.5 per participant.

495
0:23:07,360 --> 0:23:12,360
 So, we are actually doing less than that this year.

496
0:23:12,360 --> 0:23:14,360
 But this is,

497
0:23:14,360 --> 0:23:15,360
 I actually like this graph.

498
0:23:15,360 --> 0:23:16,360
 It just,

499
0:23:16,360 --> 0:23:18,360
 it actually says a lot about the activity, right?

500
0:23:18,360 --> 0:23:25,360
 So, we apparently are at 40, 60-ish,

501
0:23:25,360 --> 0:23:30,360
 and then people start arriving Thursday at 12, right?

502
0:23:30,360 --> 0:23:33,360
 And then we had some extra activity over the weekend,

503
0:23:33,360 --> 0:23:35,360
 which actually continued until Monday.

504
0:23:35,360 --> 0:23:39,360
 So, that's cool.

505
0:23:39,360 --> 0:23:40,360
 When I look at this graph,

506
0:23:40,360 --> 0:23:46,360
 we had a discussion about IoT devices.

507
0:23:46,360 --> 0:23:49,360
 So, if we are 300 people,

508
0:23:49,360 --> 0:23:50,360
 and we give every,

509
0:23:50,360 --> 0:23:53,360
 and everybody has Wi-Fi on their badge,

510
0:23:53,360 --> 0:23:55,360
 like they do in other hacker camps,

511
0:23:55,360 --> 0:23:57,360
 we kind of perhaps need to know this in advance

512
0:23:57,360 --> 0:23:59,360
 in the network team,

513
0:23:59,360 --> 0:24:03,360
 because that will basically double the amount of people connected.

514
0:24:03,360 --> 0:24:04,360
 It might not be an issue

515
0:24:04,360 --> 0:24:07,360
 if they are using really, really no power,

516
0:24:07,360 --> 0:24:08,360
 no traffic,

517
0:24:08,360 --> 0:24:09,360
 but,

518
0:24:09,360 --> 0:24:11,360
 I think it's worth discussing

519
0:24:11,360 --> 0:24:13,360
 if you want twice as many devices connected.

520
0:24:13,360 --> 0:24:17,360
 So, we are going to have a wireless discussion.

521
0:24:35,360 --> 0:24:37,360
 The comment is that last year,

522
0:24:37,360 --> 0:24:40,360
 we actually had Pixel Flute running over Wi-Fi,

523
0:24:40,360 --> 0:24:43,360
 which gave us extra connected.

524
0:24:43,360 --> 0:24:46,360
 Yes.

525
0:24:46,360 --> 0:24:48,360
 Yes, I remember two years ago

526
0:24:48,360 --> 0:24:51,360
 when I held this speech, this talk,

527
0:24:51,360 --> 0:24:55,360
 I said that having a Wi-Fi guy on terrain

528
0:24:55,360 --> 0:24:57,360
 is really, really cool.

529
0:24:57,360 --> 0:25:00,360
 It solves a lot of problems before they arise,

530
0:25:00,360 --> 0:25:02,360
 and we have had this this year also,

531
0:25:02,360 --> 0:25:05,360
 that, well, when we set all this up,

532
0:25:05,360 --> 0:25:06,360
 we actually don't know

533
0:25:06,360 --> 0:25:08,360
 where people is going to make their camps,

534
0:25:08,360 --> 0:25:09,360
 we have some black spots,

535
0:25:09,360 --> 0:25:11,360
 we have all these things that,

536
0:25:11,360 --> 0:25:15,360
 so we kind of need to move the access points a bit during camp,

537
0:25:15,360 --> 0:25:19,360
 and that requires to have on-site knowledge about this.

538
0:25:19,360 --> 0:25:21,360
 So, that is what we have been doing this time,

539
0:25:21,360 --> 0:25:25,360
 and I think it works-ish.

540
0:25:25,360 --> 0:25:28,360
 My impression is that it have worked fairly well.

541
0:25:28,360 --> 0:25:31,360
 I know that there have been some issues in different places,

542
0:25:31,360 --> 0:25:33,360
 but we'll try to rectify them.

543
0:25:33,360 --> 0:25:35,360
 If we have a guy coming in

544
0:25:35,360 --> 0:25:38,360
 at the beginning and taking it down at the end,

545
0:25:38,360 --> 0:25:41,360
 we would not have the option

546
0:25:41,360 --> 0:25:46,360
 of changing the topology a bit.

547
0:25:46,360 --> 0:25:49,360
 So, I think that's a plan that is here to stay,

548
0:25:49,360 --> 0:25:56,360
 that we somehow run the APs ourselves.

549
0:25:56,360 --> 0:26:00,360
 Okay.

550
0:26:00,360 --> 0:26:03,360
 Yes.

551
0:26:03,360 --> 0:26:04,360
 I've decided that I'm allowed

552
0:26:04,360 --> 0:26:11,360
 to spell Pixel Flute however I want to.

553
0:26:11,360 --> 0:26:16,360
 Anyway, this picture is from the bar a couple of days ago,

554
0:26:16,360 --> 0:26:20,360
 and you, of course, see that this is a big mess,

555
0:26:20,360 --> 0:26:22,360
 as Pixel Flute is supposed to be.

556
0:26:22,360 --> 0:26:24,360
 We have...

557
0:26:24,360 --> 0:26:25,360
 Hmm.

558
0:26:25,360 --> 0:26:26,360
 But I actually like this one,

559
0:26:26,360 --> 0:26:28,360
 where I don't recall his name,

560
0:26:28,360 --> 0:26:31,360
 from The Lion...

561
0:26:31,360 --> 0:26:33,360
 What's his name?

562
0:26:33,360 --> 0:26:35,360
 Rafiki.

563
0:26:35,360 --> 0:26:37,360
 Rafiki, that's true.

564
0:26:37,360 --> 0:26:39,360
 And he's just sitting there, super zen,

565
0:26:39,360 --> 0:26:42,360
 and it was a really powerful connection

566
0:26:42,360 --> 0:26:44,360
 that just made sure he stayed there.

567
0:26:44,360 --> 0:26:45,360
 That was very cool.

568
0:26:45,360 --> 0:26:49,360
 And then we, of course, have our NOC weather map,

569
0:26:49,360 --> 0:26:51,360
 just because...

570
0:26:51,360 --> 0:26:53,360
 And then...

571
0:26:53,360 --> 0:26:55,360
 I hope this is not a spoiler,

572
0:26:55,360 --> 0:26:58,360
 but my guess is that this is a token.

573
0:26:58,360 --> 0:26:59,360
 That's my guess.

574
0:26:59,360 --> 0:27:00,360
 I didn't play.

575
0:27:00,360 --> 0:27:02,360
 And then some weirdo decided

576
0:27:02,360 --> 0:27:05,360
 that we should have our NEM ID login screen also.

577
0:27:11,360 --> 0:27:12,360
 It's...

578
0:27:12,360 --> 0:27:14,360
 When I saw it the first time, I thought,

579
0:27:14,360 --> 0:27:15,360
 oh, it's a Windows machine,

580
0:27:15,360 --> 0:27:17,360
 and some Windows popped up.

581
0:27:17,360 --> 0:27:19,360
 But apparently...

582
0:27:19,360 --> 0:27:21,360
 Apparently not.

583
0:27:21,360 --> 0:27:23,360
 Anyway, as I wrote,

584
0:27:23,360 --> 0:27:25,360
 we do Pixel Flute because...

585
0:27:25,360 --> 0:27:26,360
 Because...

586
0:27:26,360 --> 0:27:27,360
 Because...

587
0:27:27,360 --> 0:27:28,360
 Because why not?

588
0:27:28,360 --> 0:27:30,360
 And so we had some infrastructure set up

589
0:27:30,360 --> 0:27:31,360
 in the...

590
0:27:31,360 --> 0:27:32,360
 In the buy area.

591
0:27:32,360 --> 0:27:33,360
 This was...

592
0:27:33,360 --> 0:27:34,360
 This was Espeon's doing.

593
0:27:34,360 --> 0:27:36,360
 We actually did not have much to do with it.

594
0:27:36,360 --> 0:27:39,360
 Otherwise, I would probably have found some graphs on that.

595
0:27:39,360 --> 0:27:42,360
 And there was something we discussed last year also,

596
0:27:42,360 --> 0:27:44,360
 that what we did...

597
0:27:44,360 --> 0:27:46,360
 We set up Pixel Flute last year also.

598
0:27:46,360 --> 0:27:47,360
 They set up.

599
0:27:47,360 --> 0:27:50,360
 And then you sat in the bar on wireless.

600
0:27:50,360 --> 0:27:53,360
 So all your flooding of this device

601
0:27:53,360 --> 0:27:57,360
 was sent over wireless to the access point.

602
0:27:57,360 --> 0:28:00,360
 The access point sent the data back to the wireless controller,

603
0:28:00,360 --> 0:28:04,360
 which sent the data back to the Pixel Flute machine.

604
0:28:04,360 --> 0:28:06,360
 Yeah, about that.

605
0:28:06,360 --> 0:28:09,360
 So we decided to have this stuff in the...

606
0:28:09,360 --> 0:28:10,360
 In the bar.

607
0:28:10,360 --> 0:28:11,360
 So there was a switch,

608
0:28:11,360 --> 0:28:12,360
 and you could sit there.

609
0:28:12,360 --> 0:28:13,360
 And...

610
0:28:13,360 --> 0:28:14,360
 We...

611
0:28:14,360 --> 0:28:17,360
 We kind of killed it from Wi-Fi,

612
0:28:17,360 --> 0:28:20,360
 and then rate limited it on cable.

613
0:28:20,360 --> 0:28:21,360
 So that was our solution,

614
0:28:21,360 --> 0:28:24,360
 so you could play along if you were not in the bar.

615
0:28:24,360 --> 0:28:26,360
 But it was a bar...

616
0:28:26,360 --> 0:28:27,360
 It was a bar game.

617
0:28:27,360 --> 0:28:28,360
 It was.

618
0:28:30,360 --> 0:28:33,360
 Okay.

619
0:28:33,360 --> 0:28:34,360
 And then...

620
0:28:34,360 --> 0:28:35,360
 The other day,

621
0:28:35,360 --> 0:28:39,360
 someone from Pyjamas, Pyjam A.S.,

622
0:28:39,360 --> 0:28:40,360
 whatever they are actually called...

623
0:28:43,360 --> 0:28:45,360
 He came and said,

624
0:28:45,360 --> 0:28:48,360
 how many public IPs can we get?

625
0:28:50,360 --> 0:28:52,360
 When I get a request like that,

626
0:28:52,360 --> 0:28:54,360
 I'm always thinking,

627
0:28:54,360 --> 0:28:56,360
 what are they up to?

628
0:28:56,360 --> 0:28:59,360
 Because, of course, I want to say yes,

629
0:28:59,360 --> 0:29:05,320
 when they want a lot of IP addresses

630
0:29:05,320 --> 0:29:07,880
 it usually means that we should have a chat about what they're doing

631
0:29:07,880 --> 0:29:09,880
 so we can see how it fits with our infrastructure

632
0:29:09,880 --> 0:29:12,520
 so the solution was

633
0:29:12,520 --> 0:29:14,620
 sure, do DHCP

634
0:29:14,620 --> 0:29:16,700
 and when you run out of the DHCP pool

635
0:29:16,700 --> 0:29:19,540
 subtract 20 so other people can connect also

636
0:29:19,540 --> 0:29:23,660
 but it was

637
0:29:23,660 --> 0:29:26,600
 in my opinion a pretty weird thing

638
0:29:26,600 --> 0:29:28,360
 that is super cool

639
0:29:28,360 --> 0:29:31,260
 so perhaps if you were here an hour ago

640
0:29:31,260 --> 0:29:32,720
 you would have heard their talk about this

641
0:29:32,720 --> 0:29:34,680
 but they have of course

642
0:29:34,680 --> 0:29:37,300
 set up a Raspberry Pi cluster

643
0:29:37,300 --> 0:29:38,920
 where when you connect to this

644
0:29:38,920 --> 0:29:42,100
 you get your own Docker instance with root access

645
0:29:42,100 --> 0:29:43,440
 where you can do whatever you want

646
0:29:43,440 --> 0:29:45,000
 of course you do

647
0:29:45,000 --> 0:29:48,960
 yeah, that's the link, right?

648
0:29:49,160 --> 0:29:50,540
 so SSH, root, whatever

649
0:29:50,540 --> 0:29:52,080
 and then you get your own

650
0:29:52,080 --> 0:29:56,780
 you get your own Docker instance

651
0:29:56,780 --> 0:29:58,180
 and as I also said

652
0:29:58,180 --> 0:30:00,140
 yeah, yeah

653
0:30:00,140 --> 0:30:04,340
 this can be abused to make problems for us

654
0:30:04,340 --> 0:30:05,760
 but hey, if that happens

655
0:30:05,760 --> 0:30:07,820
 we're probably going to do something and fix it

656
0:30:07,820 --> 0:30:09,100
 and that was fun

657
0:30:09,100 --> 0:30:11,580
 anyway, this is interesting

658
0:30:11,580 --> 0:30:13,680
 this is basically give everybody root access

659
0:30:13,680 --> 0:30:16,800
 to a hacking-capable machine on our network

660
0:30:16,800 --> 0:30:18,020
 yeah, why not?

661
0:30:18,300 --> 0:30:20,020
 this is BornHack, so of course we do that

662
0:30:20,020 --> 0:30:22,920
 and the network team just says yes

663
0:30:22,920 --> 0:30:25,160
 they are not

664
0:30:25,160 --> 0:30:26,460
 they're not all there

665
0:30:26,460 --> 0:30:27,300
 but hey, come on

666
0:30:28,180 --> 0:30:31,900
 okay

667
0:30:31,900 --> 0:30:34,000
 and then I got another one from

668
0:30:34,000 --> 0:30:35,520
 the pyjamas

669
0:30:35,520 --> 0:30:38,040
 pyjamas, whatever

670
0:30:38,040 --> 0:30:42,600
 oh, VLAN for our ESPs

671
0:30:42,600 --> 0:30:45,260
 we want it for our pixel flute

672
0:30:45,260 --> 0:30:46,520
 it was just

673
0:30:46,520 --> 0:30:47,700
 what?

674
0:30:49,400 --> 0:30:49,700
 hmm

675
0:30:49,700 --> 0:30:50,960
 okay

676
0:30:50,960 --> 0:30:52,580
 sure

677
0:30:52,580 --> 0:30:54,340
 we can set this up

678
0:30:54,340 --> 0:30:58,160
 I wasn't even going to say this

679
0:30:58,180 --> 0:30:59,920
 I was just going into the discussion about

680
0:30:59,920 --> 0:31:03,940
 comparing some wireless VLAN thing with

681
0:31:03,940 --> 0:31:06,600
 the 10 gig cable connections in the bar

682
0:31:06,600 --> 0:31:08,340
 but hey

683
0:31:08,340 --> 0:31:09,180
 so

684
0:31:09,180 --> 0:31:10,020
 it wasn't the client

685
0:31:10,020 --> 0:31:12,540
 it was the pixel flute server

686
0:31:12,540 --> 0:31:14,180
 on the ESP

687
0:31:14,180 --> 0:31:18,860
 we're not competing with the client

688
0:31:18,860 --> 0:31:21,900
 so, how did it go for them?

689
0:31:21,900 --> 0:31:22,900
 huh?

690
0:31:22,900 --> 0:31:25,900
 so, so the question is

691
0:31:25,900 --> 0:31:26,900
 so, so the question is

692
0:31:26,900 --> 0:31:27,900
 so, so the question is

693
0:31:27,900 --> 0:31:32,900
 which of the images you saw on the other pixel flute thing was them?

694
0:31:32,900 --> 0:31:35,900
 well, well

695
0:31:35,900 --> 0:31:38,900
 this was the pixel flute thing

696
0:31:38,900 --> 0:31:43,900
 that made so much more sense

697
0:31:43,900 --> 0:31:45,900
 I actually think it's really nice

698
0:31:45,900 --> 0:31:50,900
 it's just a bunch of the IODs and then hammer it just like you do with the other pixel flute

699
0:31:50,900 --> 0:31:52,900
 and then get a nice blanket out of it

700
0:31:52,900 --> 0:31:55,900
 it was a nice idea but, you know, first things

701
0:31:55,900 --> 0:31:56,740
 we want a VLAN for all of us, right?

702
0:31:56,740 --> 0:31:57,100
 we want a VLAN for all of us, right?

703
0:31:57,100 --> 0:31:57,600
 we want a VLAN for all of us, right?

704
0:31:57,600 --> 0:31:57,700
 we want a VLAN for all of us, right?

705
0:31:57,700 --> 0:31:58,700
 it was all good

706
0:31:58,700 --> 0:31:59,700
 we wanted to have a VLAN for pixel flute

707
0:31:59,700 --> 0:32:00,700
 mmmmmmmm

708
0:32:00,700 --> 0:32:01,700
 mmmmmm

709
0:32:01,700 --> 0:32:02,700
 mmmmmm

710
0:32:02,700 --> 0:32:03,700
 mmmmmm

711
0:32:03,700 --> 0:32:04,700
 mmmmmm

712
0:32:04,700 --> 0:32:05,700
 good luck

713
0:32:05,700 --> 0:32:06,700
 good luck

714
0:32:06,700 --> 0:32:07,700
 I've seen the machinery people have brought

715
0:32:07,700 --> 0:32:08,700
 I don't think you're gonna rule that machine

716
0:32:08,700 --> 0:32:09,700
 I don't think so

717
0:32:09,700 --> 0:32:10,700
 but anyway

718
0:32:10,700 --> 0:32:11,700
 that looks nice

719
0:32:11,700 --> 0:32:12,700
 that looks nice

720
0:32:12,700 --> 0:32:21,700
 and then we had a workshop on DDoS

721
0:32:21,700 --> 0:32:25,200
 Yay!

722
0:32:25,200 --> 0:32:26,200
 yes

723
0:32:26,200 --> 0:32:26,700
 yeah

724
0:32:26,700 --> 0:32:33,900
 had a super successful workshop on DDoS and it was so successful it took down network

725
0:32:33,900 --> 0:32:45,640
 on the entire camp. Yay! So as DDoS goes, I think that was one of the more successful

726
0:32:45,640 --> 0:32:55,480
 workshops. But the thing that actually happened was that Kramse moved from noisy to camping.

727
0:32:55,480 --> 0:33:01,440
 Who would have thought that? Maybe even perhaps people in the NOC team, like Kramse, might

728
0:33:01,440 --> 0:33:07,640
 have known a bit about topology, but hey. But the thing we have done is that we have

729
0:33:07,640 --> 0:33:16,760
 a south VLAN for the camp and a north, and noisy is in the south, and the building is

730
0:33:16,760 --> 0:33:22,600
 in the south, and camping is in the north. So if you do weird stuff like having your

731
0:33:22,600 --> 0:33:25,460
 own 10 gig connection in your tent, and do...

732
0:33:25,460 --> 0:33:34,360
 If you do a workshop on DDoS, it's smart to be in the same group, in the same segment.

733
0:33:34,360 --> 0:33:42,840
 And so moving to north means that everything had to go through our router. So it kind of

734
0:33:42,840 --> 0:33:51,100
 just gave up. It was just maxed out and that's fine. We kind of changed the design just a

735
0:33:51,100 --> 0:33:54,460
 tad for the second workshop, so nobody noticed it.

736
0:33:55,460 --> 0:34:11,600
 Okay, I'm not to say that we used HPing 3 and T50. That's a secret. Anyway, I think

737
0:34:11,600 --> 0:34:17,080
 it's funny to make a DDoS workshop and take down the entire network. I think that's so

738
0:34:17,080 --> 0:34:25,440
 cool. No, anyway. That's what I've decided to include in my presentation for today. I

739
0:34:25,460 --> 0:34:33,220
 noticed that last year I kind of forgot this slide, so I just... We cut the feed and then

740
0:34:33,220 --> 0:34:38,460
 we started it again because there might have been questions. So let's remember this today.

741
0:34:38,460 --> 0:34:43,460
 Are there any questions? Mike?

742
0:34:43,460 --> 0:34:47,460
 .

743
0:34:47,460 --> 0:34:52,460
 .

744
0:34:52,460 --> 0:34:53,460
 .

745
0:34:53,460 --> 0:34:54,460
 .

746
0:34:54,460 --> 0:34:55,460
 .

747
0:34:55,460 --> 0:34:55,740
 .

748
0:34:55,740 --> 0:35:02,700
 Alright, good.

749
0:35:02,700 --> 0:35:06,560
 .

750
0:35:06,560 --> 0:35:09,720
 How many IP addresses do we have on cam?

751
0:35:09,720 --> 0:35:11,020
 .

752
0:35:11,020 --> 0:35:13,460
 .

753
0:35:13,460 --> 0:35:15,380
 That's a really good question.

754
0:35:15,380 --> 0:35:17,560
 .

755
0:35:17,560 --> 0:35:19,440
 Public.

756
0:35:19,440 --> 0:35:22,500
 Public?

757
0:35:22,500 --> 0:35:24,440
 Well, we have slash 23 or something of IP version, IP version 4, and then We have our own segment for IP

758
0:35:24,440 --> 0:35:24,960
 version 6 or permanent one. I actually don't recall these numbers.

759
0:35:24,960 --> 0:35:25,460
 .

760
0:35:25,460 --> 0:35:28,580
 So that would be public IP version 6.

761
0:35:29,120 --> 0:35:31,600
 These would be, yeah, some of you may have noticed

762
0:35:31,600 --> 0:35:34,420
 that when you go to different sites,

763
0:35:35,040 --> 0:35:37,760
 they think you are in some other country.

764
0:35:38,860 --> 0:35:42,580
 I remember one year in Bornheg, they thought we were in Poland.

765
0:35:43,300 --> 0:35:47,240
 But it's about which geolocation database you use

766
0:35:47,240 --> 0:35:48,740
 and how fast they update it and such,

767
0:35:49,140 --> 0:35:51,440
 because the IP version 4 addresses we have

768
0:35:51,440 --> 0:35:54,600
 are ones that we borrow from RIPE for this event.

769
0:35:54,600 --> 0:35:56,380
 It's event IP addresses.

770
0:35:57,240 --> 0:36:01,300
 And the IP version 6 is ours, and they will not change.

771
0:36:01,700 --> 0:36:04,700
 So we, of course, are going to transition to IP version 6,

772
0:36:05,520 --> 0:36:06,140
 says Kramse.

773
0:36:08,120 --> 0:36:09,800
 IP version 6 only next year.

774
0:36:10,260 --> 0:36:11,000
 Good luck with that.

775
0:36:11,620 --> 0:36:12,980
 Why did the Wi-Fi crash?

776
0:36:19,860 --> 0:36:23,080
 I have this comment.

777
0:36:23,080 --> 0:36:24,580
 And this is the official...

778
0:36:24,600 --> 0:36:26,240
 What's the unofficial comment to this?

779
0:36:26,780 --> 0:36:27,920
 What's the unofficial comment?

780
0:36:29,300 --> 0:36:29,860
 Aliens.

781
0:36:30,280 --> 0:36:30,720
 Aliens.

782
0:36:31,300 --> 0:36:34,660
 It was a solar flare, which, you know,

783
0:36:34,780 --> 0:36:37,340
 and the UFO did, and a little small goblin,

784
0:36:37,560 --> 0:36:39,880
 and a massive... I don't know.

785
0:36:40,580 --> 0:36:41,380
 It's a secret.

786
0:36:42,220 --> 0:36:47,200
 It wasn't a manual error in any way.

787
0:36:49,080 --> 0:36:52,680
 I can neither confirm nor deny that it was a manual error.

788
0:36:54,600 --> 0:36:56,260
 It's being verycovered.

789
0:36:56,280 --> 0:36:58,920
 Well, yeah, Dudeau, really, good chat with you.

790
0:36:59,120 --> 0:37:00,260
 What about the about Kiwi?

791
0:37:00,860 --> 0:37:02,040
 Just que thank you a lot.

792
0:37:02,920 --> 0:37:05,120
 So this is the very first message to Let's Set off.

793
0:37:05,160 --> 0:37:06,280
 Let's Start.

794
0:37:06,640 --> 0:37:08,180
 To Good even if you wanna come to me?

795
0:37:08,400 --> 0:37:09,660
 That créer por favor.

796
0:37:09,660 --> 0:37:10,440
 As always.

797
0:37:10,440 --> 0:37:11,060
 Thanks, guys.

798
0:37:11,400 --> 0:37:11,920
 Thank you.

799
0:37:12,380 --> 0:37:13,480
 Yes, thanks very much.

800
0:37:13,480 --> 0:37:15,000
 We had the opportunity to meet,

801
0:37:15,300 --> 0:37:16,660
 and to kind of camera all along.

802
0:37:17,060 --> 0:37:18,240
 That Đoan Huy and Philips were with me đó

803
0:37:18,240 --> 0:37:19,480
 the night before.

804
0:37:19,480 --> 0:37:20,560
 That night was really fantastic.

805
0:37:20,960 --> 0:37:22,980
 I really enjoyed that day.

806
0:37:22,980 --> 0:37:38,880
 7.41 terabytes downloaded so we downloaded 7.41 terabytes and we uploaded 2.74 terabytes

807
0:37:38,880 --> 0:37:45,320
 it's comparable to uh to last year i remember it as five last year

808
0:37:45,320 --> 0:37:53,320
 yes we could for example use

809
0:37:53,320 --> 0:38:06,460
 we could for example use five times as much bandwidth for example and even better um

810
0:38:06,460 --> 0:38:12,060
 not to be mentioned to people but there might have been a slight difference in the bandwidth

811
0:38:12,060 --> 0:38:15,160
 available on ip version 4 and 6 as in

812
0:38:15,160 --> 0:38:15,300
 you know we could for example use five times as much bandwidth for example and even better

813
0:38:15,320 --> 0:38:18,520
 factor three or five or something so

814
0:38:18,520 --> 0:38:30,220
 hey there also was uh used more bandwidth than visible there because uh that those graphs

815
0:38:30,220 --> 0:38:35,920
 are five minute averages yes we might have uh peaks that are much larger we had a lot

816
0:38:35,920 --> 0:38:45,160
 of peaks around uh one gig um on 20 second averages yes but um yeah this is uh

817
0:38:45,160 --> 0:38:56,360
 of peaks around uh one gig um on 20 second averages yes but um yeah this is uh five minute averages which of course means that uh there might be in instances probably a lot of instances where someone maxes it out for five seconds and such we will not be able to see that here

818
0:38:56,360 --> 0:38:59,160
 five seconds and such we will not be able to see that here yes

819
0:38:59,160 --> 0:39:04,860
 any more questions

820
0:39:04,860 --> 0:39:09,400
 then i think the network team deserves a big round of applause
