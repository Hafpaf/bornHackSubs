 Tijana Mihajlović Reviewer Reviewer's Name

2
0:00:07,000 --> 0:00:09,000
 Well, thank you very much.

3
0:00:09,000 --> 0:00:12,000
 So, this is the title of my book,

4
0:00:12,000 --> 0:00:17,000
 and you are going to be the test audience for the synopsis of my book.

5
0:00:17,000 --> 0:00:21,000
 So, what I've done now is I've taken the subjects in the order

6
0:00:21,000 --> 0:00:24,000
 I'm going to talk about them and put them into a slide.

7
0:00:24,000 --> 0:00:27,000
 I'm not going to read you the entire book,

8
0:00:27,000 --> 0:00:31,000
 but I'm going to tell you the story in a lecture form,

9
0:00:31,000 --> 0:00:33,000
 so in a shorter way.

10
0:00:33,000 --> 0:00:37,000
 And I would really much like for you afterwards to tell me

11
0:00:37,000 --> 0:00:42,000
 if this order is good for the book or if you think I should change anything.

12
0:00:42,000 --> 0:00:45,000
 But you will also be getting a really nice story,

13
0:00:45,000 --> 0:00:47,000
 so I hope you enjoy it.

14
0:00:47,000 --> 0:00:52,000
 So, first of all, this machine is arguably

15
0:00:52,000 --> 0:00:56,000
 the first serial series-produced Danish microcomputer,

16
0:00:56,000 --> 0:00:59,000
 but the predecessor to it, the Pearl Stripe,

17
0:00:59,000 --> 0:01:03,000
 is undoubtedly the first Danish microcomputer ever.

18
0:01:03,000 --> 0:01:06,000
 So, there was a bit about who did what first,

19
0:01:06,000 --> 0:01:09,000
 and if you announce the computer before you produce it,

20
0:01:09,000 --> 0:01:11,000
 who wins and stuff like that.

21
0:01:11,000 --> 0:01:14,000
 So, I choose to call this the first Danish microcomputer,

22
0:01:14,000 --> 0:01:20,000
 and I have like 50 kilos of arguments for that back in my office

23
0:01:20,000 --> 0:01:23,000
 because I have collected a lot of material.

24
0:01:23,000 --> 0:01:25,000
 This is most likely the...

25
0:01:26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
 most well-prepared talk you'll hear this year.

26
0:01:29,000 --> 0:01:33,000
 I have been studying for this for almost four years.

27
0:01:33,000 --> 0:01:37,000
 So, and when I started researching about this computer,

28
0:01:37,000 --> 0:01:41,000
 I was expecting it to be an article, a really short thing,

29
0:01:41,000 --> 0:01:43,000
 maybe a Wikipedia thing.

30
0:01:43,000 --> 0:01:47,000
 And then I started digging, and suddenly it all blew up in my head,

31
0:01:47,000 --> 0:01:51,000
 and I was taken back to 1972

32
0:01:51,000 --> 0:01:54,000
 where this Danish dude by the name Boe,

33
0:01:54,000 --> 0:01:55,000
 I'm so sorry.

34
0:01:55,000 --> 0:01:58,000
 He died before we could take a good picture of him.

35
0:01:58,000 --> 0:02:05,000
 But Boe Rosgaard Christensen, nice last name,

36
0:02:05,000 --> 0:02:12,000
 was an associate professor in Tønder College of Education.

37
0:02:12,000 --> 0:02:15,000
 That is a Danish school where they train teachers

38
0:02:15,000 --> 0:02:17,000
 for like the rest of the country.

39
0:02:17,000 --> 0:02:21,000
 It's not the only of its kind, but it's one of them.

40
0:02:21,000 --> 0:02:23,000
 He was an eager and insisting advocate

41
0:02:23,000 --> 0:02:24,000
 for proper computer science.

42
0:02:24,000 --> 0:02:26,000
 Proper computer science teaching in Denmark.

43
0:02:26,000 --> 0:02:30,000
 So he's famous for saying that basics should be illegal.

44
0:02:30,000 --> 0:02:34,000
 And he was an extremely productive author.

45
0:02:34,000 --> 0:02:37,000
 I have 12 books by his name,

46
0:02:37,000 --> 0:02:40,000
 and that's only the 12 I succeeded to get my hands on.

47
0:02:40,000 --> 0:02:44,000
 Yeah, and then he was a language geek.

48
0:02:44,000 --> 0:02:47,000
 I don't know if you know about the language Interlingua.

49
0:02:47,000 --> 0:02:49,000
 You most likely know about Esperanto.

50
0:02:49,000 --> 0:02:51,000
 Interlingua is...

51
0:02:51,000 --> 0:02:53,000
 Don't quote me on this, but...

52
0:02:54,000 --> 0:02:55,000
 More or less the same.

53
0:02:55,000 --> 0:02:58,000
 So they're trying to make an international language

54
0:02:58,000 --> 0:03:00,000
 without any exceptions.

55
0:03:00,000 --> 0:03:02,000
 So if you know the grammar rules,

56
0:03:02,000 --> 0:03:05,000
 those will always apply.

57
0:03:05,000 --> 0:03:09,000
 And he spent 20 years of his life as a board member

58
0:03:09,000 --> 0:03:12,000
 for the committee developing this language.

59
0:03:12,000 --> 0:03:16,000
 So it's safe to say that A, that dude likes rules,

60
0:03:16,000 --> 0:03:19,000
 and B, that dude likes languages.

61
0:03:19,000 --> 0:03:22,000
 So that's a bit about him.

62
0:03:22,000 --> 0:03:26,000
 Back in 72, no, 71,

63
0:03:26,000 --> 0:03:30,000
 his institution got a data general computer

64
0:03:30,000 --> 0:03:33,000
 called Nova 1200.

65
0:03:33,000 --> 0:03:35,000
 This was a machine sold by Reines & Thalen

66
0:03:35,000 --> 0:03:37,000
 under a different name,

67
0:03:37,000 --> 0:03:41,000
 but in essence, this was a data general machine.

68
0:03:41,000 --> 0:03:43,000
 He started teaching on it,

69
0:03:43,000 --> 0:03:46,000
 and he started teaching his students BASIC.

70
0:03:46,000 --> 0:03:49,000
 And if any of you know how to program BASIC,

71
0:03:49,000 --> 0:03:50,000
 you know that it's fine,

72
0:03:50,000 --> 0:03:51,000
 as long as all the languages,

73
0:03:51,000 --> 0:03:54,000
 as long as all the lines of code can be on the screen.

74
0:03:54,000 --> 0:03:56,000
 As soon as you reach line number 25,

75
0:03:56,000 --> 0:03:59,000
 it starts becoming chaos.

76
0:03:59,000 --> 0:04:02,000
 So he complained a lot about this,

77
0:04:02,000 --> 0:04:05,000
 and around the spring of 72,

78
0:04:05,000 --> 0:04:07,000
 he met this computer scientist in Aarhus

79
0:04:07,000 --> 0:04:09,000
 called Benedikt Lyfstedt,

80
0:04:09,000 --> 0:04:11,000
 and together with him,

81
0:04:11,000 --> 0:04:13,000
 they started formulating this new language,

82
0:04:13,000 --> 0:04:17,000
 which should be a combination of Pascal and BASIC.

83
0:04:17,000 --> 0:04:20,000
 And this Bero dude is very talkative

84
0:04:20,000 --> 0:04:22,000
 and very convincing,

85
0:04:22,000 --> 0:04:25,000
 and has like the energy of a nuclear bomb.

86
0:04:25,000 --> 0:04:28,000
 So I'm sure he just overwhelmed Reines & Thalen

87
0:04:28,000 --> 0:04:31,000
 with good intentions and with questions

88
0:04:31,000 --> 0:04:32,000
 and with interest,

89
0:04:32,000 --> 0:04:36,000
 because sometime during the first half of 1972,

90
0:04:36,000 --> 0:04:39,000
 they actually gave him the source code for the BASIC

91
0:04:39,000 --> 0:04:41,000
 they used on their systems.

92
0:04:41,000 --> 0:04:42,000
 He hired some student workers

93
0:04:42,000 --> 0:04:44,000
 and got those student workers

94
0:04:44,000 --> 0:04:47,000
 to change this BASIC into a COMAL.

95
0:04:47,000 --> 0:04:49,000
 So one of the main differences is that

96
0:04:49,000 --> 0:04:53,000
 COMAL in COMAL GoTo is like prohibited.

97
0:04:53,000 --> 0:04:56,000
 It's not, but in essence,

98
0:04:56,000 --> 0:04:57,000
 you shouldn't use it.

99
0:04:57,000 --> 0:04:59,000
 So you have function calls and procedure calls,

100
0:04:59,000 --> 0:05:01,000
 and it's a more structured language.

101
0:05:01,000 --> 0:05:04,000
 So they turned this old BASIC

102
0:05:04,000 --> 0:05:06,000
 into a more structured BASIC,

103
0:05:06,000 --> 0:05:07,000
 and in the beginning,

104
0:05:07,000 --> 0:05:09,000
 they actually called it RCE BASIC,

105
0:05:09,000 --> 0:05:10,000
 Reines & Thalen BASIC,

106
0:05:10,000 --> 0:05:12,000
 but soon they changed the name to COMAL,

107
0:05:12,000 --> 0:05:16,000
 which is short for COMAL.

108
0:05:16,000 --> 0:05:18,000
 I should have written this down.

109
0:05:18,000 --> 0:05:20,000
 Common...

110
0:05:20,000 --> 0:05:21,000
 Did I write...?

111
0:05:21,000 --> 0:05:22,000
 Yeah, of course I did write that.

112
0:05:22,000 --> 0:05:24,000
 Common Algorithmic Language.

113
0:05:24,000 --> 0:05:25,000
 I did write it down.

114
0:05:25,000 --> 0:05:26,000
 Thank you.

115
0:05:28,000 --> 0:05:32,000
 And then he used his position

116
0:05:32,000 --> 0:05:34,000
 as a teacher-teacher.

117
0:05:34,000 --> 0:05:36,000
 So he teaches the teachers

118
0:05:36,000 --> 0:05:38,000
 to influence the teachers

119
0:05:38,000 --> 0:05:41,000
 that they should use COMAL,

120
0:05:41,000 --> 0:05:43,000
 which is super awesome,

121
0:05:43,000 --> 0:05:46,000
 because during the last part of the 70s,

122
0:05:46,000 --> 0:05:47,000
 suddenly it became

123
0:05:47,000 --> 0:05:49,000
 a standard demand from schools.

124
0:05:49,000 --> 0:05:50,000
 Oh, by the way,

125
0:05:50,000 --> 0:05:52,000
 your computer doesn't run COMAL.

126
0:05:52,000 --> 0:05:53,000
 We don't want it.

127
0:05:53,000 --> 0:05:55,000
 But it's better and cheaper.

128
0:05:55,000 --> 0:05:56,000
 It doesn't run COMAL.

129
0:05:56,000 --> 0:05:58,000
 So he kind of forced everybody

130
0:05:58,000 --> 0:06:00,000
 to implement COMAL

131
0:06:00,000 --> 0:06:02,000
 in order to get

132
0:06:02,000 --> 0:06:06,000
 systems to the Danish schools.

133
0:06:06,000 --> 0:06:09,000
 We got a story from the head

134
0:06:09,000 --> 0:06:11,000
 of the data department

135
0:06:11,000 --> 0:06:15,000
 on Odense College of Education

136
0:06:15,000 --> 0:06:17,000
 where he called the guy,

137
0:06:17,000 --> 0:06:20,000
 the 26th of December,

138
0:06:20,000 --> 0:06:21,000
 and said,

139
0:06:21,000 --> 0:06:22,000
 oh, can I come by?

140
0:06:22,000 --> 0:06:23,000
 I need to show you something.

141
0:06:23,000 --> 0:06:24,000
 Ah, we're really busy.

142
0:06:24,000 --> 0:06:26,000
 We have this family thing, you know.

143
0:06:26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
 Okay, tomorrow then?

144
0:06:28,000 --> 0:06:33,000
 So during the Christmas holiday,

145
0:06:33,000 --> 0:06:35,000
 he influenced his colleague

146
0:06:35,000 --> 0:06:38,000
 at the next over college of education

147
0:06:38,000 --> 0:06:40,000
 to start using COMAL as well,

148
0:06:40,000 --> 0:06:42,000
 and he succeeded in just one day.

149
0:06:42,000 --> 0:06:44,000
 He gave some guest lectures

150
0:06:44,000 --> 0:06:46,000
 in Germany, West Germany,

151
0:06:46,000 --> 0:06:49,000
 and he got it spread

152
0:06:49,000 --> 0:06:50,000
 to most of Europe

153
0:06:50,000 --> 0:06:52,000
 just by being really energetic

154
0:06:52,000 --> 0:06:54,000
 and talking about it.

155
0:06:54,000 --> 0:06:55,000
 And down the road,

156
0:06:55,000 --> 0:06:58,000
 he actually managed to sell

157
0:06:58,000 --> 0:07:00,000
 this idea to Commodore.

158
0:07:00,000 --> 0:07:01,000
 And during the 80s,

159
0:07:01,000 --> 0:07:03,000
 Commodore made a version,

160
0:07:03,000 --> 0:07:05,000
 the best ever,

161
0:07:05,000 --> 0:07:08,000
 and they sold it in the entire world.

162
0:07:08,000 --> 0:07:10,000
 And actually, it has been taught

163
0:07:10,000 --> 0:07:13,000
 that the biggest user group

164
0:07:13,000 --> 0:07:15,000
 of COMAL in general is American.

165
0:07:15,000 --> 0:07:18,000
 And we have like 2,400 pages

166
0:07:18,000 --> 0:07:21,000
 of their user magazine,

167
0:07:21,000 --> 0:07:24,000
 which is a huge source of information.

168
0:07:24,000 --> 0:07:27,000
 And finally, he used

169
0:07:27,000 --> 0:07:28,000
 the university center

170
0:07:28,000 --> 0:07:29,000
 of Southern Jutland

171
0:07:29,000 --> 0:07:32,000
 to fund lots of his work.

172
0:07:32,000 --> 0:07:34,000
 So this is not a real university.

173
0:07:34,000 --> 0:07:35,000
 It was like,

174
0:07:35,000 --> 0:07:36,000
 so in Southern Jutland,

175
0:07:36,000 --> 0:07:39,000
 they asked the government

176
0:07:39,000 --> 0:07:40,000
 for a university,

177
0:07:40,000 --> 0:07:41,000
 and during,

178
0:07:41,000 --> 0:07:42,000
 I don't remember it exactly,

179
0:07:42,000 --> 0:07:44,000
 but around 1773,

180
0:07:44,000 --> 0:07:45,000
 the government said,

181
0:07:45,000 --> 0:07:46,000
 yes, you can have a university

182
0:07:46,000 --> 0:07:47,000
 in two years.

183
0:07:47,000 --> 0:07:49,000
 So the local municipality said,

184
0:07:49,000 --> 0:07:51,000
 cool, we'll just get started,

185
0:07:51,000 --> 0:07:54,000
 and they funded the startup

186
0:07:54,000 --> 0:07:55,000
 of it themselves.

187
0:07:55,000 --> 0:07:56,000
 And after two years,

188
0:07:56,000 --> 0:07:57,000
 the government was just like,

189
0:07:57,000 --> 0:07:58,000
 nah, we're good.

190
0:07:58,000 --> 0:08:00,000
 And so they just kept

191
0:08:00,000 --> 0:08:02,000
 funding it themselves.

192
0:08:02,000 --> 0:08:03,000
 So it's not a real university,

193
0:08:03,000 --> 0:08:06,000
 but for all practical purposes,

194
0:08:06,000 --> 0:08:07,000
 it is.

195
0:08:07,000 --> 0:08:08,000
 They had some money,

196
0:08:08,000 --> 0:08:09,000
 which they could use

197
0:08:09,000 --> 0:08:10,000
 for research,

198
0:08:10,000 --> 0:08:11,000
 and Berg Christensen

199
0:08:11,000 --> 0:08:13,000
 got paid some money

200
0:08:13,000 --> 0:08:14,000
 to develop Comal.

201
0:08:14,000 --> 0:08:15,000
 And later on,

202
0:08:15,000 --> 0:08:17,000
 he got this crazy idea

203
0:08:17,000 --> 0:08:18,000
 that I'll talk more about

204
0:08:18,000 --> 0:08:20,000
 in a little bit,

205
0:08:20,000 --> 0:08:21,000
 because we need to travel

206
0:08:21,000 --> 0:08:22,000
 back in time again.

207
0:08:22,000 --> 0:08:24,000
 Now we're back in 1777,

208
0:08:24,000 --> 0:08:25,000
 where this dude

209
0:08:25,000 --> 0:08:26,000
 called Mons Pele,

210
0:08:26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
 he finished his degree

211
0:08:28,000 --> 0:08:30,000
 of Electrical Engineering

212
0:08:30,000 --> 0:08:31,000
 in 1773,

213
0:08:31,000 --> 0:08:33,000
 and has been writing

214
0:08:33,000 --> 0:08:34,000
 technical instructions,

215
0:08:34,000 --> 0:08:35,000
 you know,

216
0:08:35,000 --> 0:08:37,000
 build guides for,

217
0:08:37,000 --> 0:08:38,000
 you know,

218
0:08:38,000 --> 0:08:39,000
 back then when you were a geek,

219
0:08:39,000 --> 0:08:40,000
 you didn't have the internet,

220
0:08:40,000 --> 0:08:41,000
 so you bought these things

221
0:08:41,000 --> 0:08:42,000
 out of paper

222
0:08:42,000 --> 0:08:44,000
 called magazines,

223
0:08:44,000 --> 0:08:45,000
 and there was basically

224
0:08:45,000 --> 0:08:46,000
 a large block,

225
0:08:46,000 --> 0:08:49,000
 and he wrote guides

226
0:08:49,000 --> 0:08:50,000
 on to build different stuff

227
0:08:50,000 --> 0:08:52,000
 for this block.

228
0:08:52,000 --> 0:08:54,000
 Well, mostly he read guides

229
0:08:54,000 --> 0:08:56,000
 from international magazines,

230
0:08:56,000 --> 0:08:57,000
 translated them to Danish,

231
0:08:57,000 --> 0:08:59,000
 and republished them.

232
0:08:59,000 --> 0:09:01,000
 And that is so many years ago

233
0:09:01,000 --> 0:09:03,000
 that it's probably not,

234
0:09:03,000 --> 0:09:04,000
 I don't know,

235
0:09:04,000 --> 0:09:05,000
 it's probably still illegal,

236
0:09:05,000 --> 0:09:07,000
 but it was a bit sketchy.

237
0:09:07,000 --> 0:09:08,000
 Anyway,

238
0:09:08,000 --> 0:09:09,000
 that was what he did,

239
0:09:09,000 --> 0:09:11,000
 and he used this platform

240
0:09:11,000 --> 0:09:12,000
 to,

241
0:09:12,000 --> 0:09:13,000
 when he got access

242
0:09:13,000 --> 0:09:15,000
 to a Zilog Z80 processor,

243
0:09:15,000 --> 0:09:17,000
 as one of the first in Denmark,

244
0:09:17,000 --> 0:09:18,000
 he used the platform

245
0:09:18,000 --> 0:09:19,000
 from this magazine

246
0:09:19,000 --> 0:09:21,000
 to start publishing schematics

247
0:09:21,000 --> 0:09:23,000
 for a computer that he designed,

248
0:09:23,000 --> 0:09:27,000
 and started a movement

249
0:09:27,000 --> 0:09:29,000
 of data machine amateurs,

250
0:09:29,000 --> 0:09:31,000
 he called them.

251
0:09:31,000 --> 0:09:33,000
 They were in several

252
0:09:33,000 --> 0:09:35,000
 global Danish medias,

253
0:09:35,000 --> 0:09:38,000
 and he got really a lot

254
0:09:38,000 --> 0:09:39,000
 of press on that,

255
0:09:39,000 --> 0:09:41,000
 so he founded a company

256
0:09:41,000 --> 0:09:43,000
 down here,

257
0:09:43,000 --> 0:09:45,000
 Metanic APS,

258
0:09:45,000 --> 0:09:48,000
 and started selling PCBs,

259
0:09:48,000 --> 0:09:50,000
 and in the beginning

260
0:09:50,000 --> 0:09:52,000
 he only wanted to sell PCBs,

261
0:09:52,000 --> 0:09:54,000
 but then suddenly a guy

262
0:09:54,000 --> 0:09:57,000
 from this Southern University Center

263
0:09:57,000 --> 0:09:59,000
 wrote him and said,

264
0:09:59,000 --> 0:10:00,000
 I read your article

265
0:10:00,000 --> 0:10:01,000
 about that computer,

266
0:10:01,000 --> 0:10:02,000
 I want to buy one.

267
0:10:02,000 --> 0:10:03,000
 And he was just like,

268
0:10:03,000 --> 0:10:04,000
 we don't sell them,

269
0:10:04,000 --> 0:10:05,000
 but I want to buy one,

270
0:10:05,000 --> 0:10:07,000
 you can build one.

271
0:10:07,000 --> 0:10:08,000
 I don't want to buy one,

272
0:10:08,000 --> 0:10:10,000
 I want to buy one.

273
0:10:10,000 --> 0:10:11,000
 So he built one,

274
0:10:11,000 --> 0:10:13,000
 and sold to that guy,

275
0:10:13,000 --> 0:10:14,000
 and that guy was

276
0:10:14,000 --> 0:10:16,000
 Bero Christensen.

277
0:10:16,000 --> 0:10:19,000
 So that escalated,

278
0:10:19,000 --> 0:10:22,000
 but yeah,

279
0:10:22,000 --> 0:10:23,000
 before we get to that,

280
0:10:23,000 --> 0:10:24,000
 I just want to mention,

281
0:10:24,000 --> 0:10:27,000
 the users that started

282
0:10:27,000 --> 0:10:28,000
 building this machine

283
0:10:28,000 --> 0:10:29,000
 also founded the user group,

284
0:10:29,000 --> 0:10:30,000
 and they actually produced

285
0:10:30,000 --> 0:10:32,000
 the NPS 2000 user group magazine

286
0:10:32,000 --> 0:10:33,000
 for about a year,

287
0:10:33,000 --> 0:10:35,000
 which is also one of the great

288
0:10:35,000 --> 0:10:38,000
 sources we have for these stories.

289
0:10:38,000 --> 0:10:39,000
 And I might,

290
0:10:39,000 --> 0:10:41,000
 I might have forgot to mention

291
0:10:41,000 --> 0:10:42,000
 in the beginning,

292
0:10:42,000 --> 0:10:44,000
 but all this information

293
0:10:44,000 --> 0:10:45,000
 is something I have dug out

294
0:10:45,000 --> 0:10:47,000
 from either interviews,

295
0:10:47,000 --> 0:10:48,000
 or old magazines,

296
0:10:48,000 --> 0:10:49,000
 or like,

297
0:10:49,000 --> 0:10:50,000
 there's no history book about this,

298
0:10:50,000 --> 0:10:53,000
 this is what I'm writing.

299
0:10:53,000 --> 0:10:54,000
 So I have been through

300
0:10:54,000 --> 0:10:55,000
 old archives,

301
0:10:55,000 --> 0:10:57,000
 through old reading,

302
0:10:57,000 --> 0:10:59,000
 30 year old newspapers,

303
0:10:59,000 --> 0:11:01,000
 and accountings,

304
0:11:01,000 --> 0:11:03,000
 and it's been a really like

305
0:11:03,000 --> 0:11:05,000
 investigative journalism

306
0:11:05,000 --> 0:11:08,000
 with 40 years of delay.

307
0:11:08,000 --> 0:11:09,000
 Anyway,

308
0:11:09,000 --> 0:11:10,000
 let's go to the

309
0:11:10,000 --> 0:11:12,000
 Southern University Center.

310
0:11:12,000 --> 0:11:13,000
 So in 72,

311
0:11:13,000 --> 0:11:16,000
 they decided that

312
0:11:16,000 --> 0:11:18,000
 we need some of this,

313
0:11:18,000 --> 0:11:20,000
 in Danish we said

314
0:11:20,000 --> 0:11:21,000
 EDB,

315
0:11:21,000 --> 0:11:22,000
 which stands for

316
0:11:22,000 --> 0:11:24,000
 Electronical Data

317
0:11:24,000 --> 0:11:25,000
 Behandling,

318
0:11:25,000 --> 0:11:26,000
 Processing,

319
0:11:26,000 --> 0:11:27,000
 which is,

320
0:11:27,000 --> 0:11:28,000
 you can translate it today

321
0:11:28,000 --> 0:11:29,000
 with IT,

322
0:11:29,000 --> 0:11:30,000
 information technology,

323
0:11:30,000 --> 0:11:32,000
 but they founded

324
0:11:32,000 --> 0:11:35,000
 the EDB Council,

325
0:11:35,000 --> 0:11:38,000
 and the idea with the EDB Council

326
0:11:38,000 --> 0:11:39,000
 was that they should build

327
0:11:39,000 --> 0:11:42,000
 a data center in Esbjerg,

328
0:11:42,000 --> 0:11:44,000
 which is one of the most,

329
0:11:44,000 --> 0:11:45,000
 so well,

330
0:11:45,000 --> 0:11:47,000
 if you leave towards Jutland now

331
0:11:47,000 --> 0:11:49,000
 and just keep driving west,

332
0:11:49,000 --> 0:11:50,000
 you'll end up in Esbjerg,

333
0:11:50,000 --> 0:11:52,000
 that's one of the most,

334
0:11:52,000 --> 0:11:53,000
 I don't know if they still do fishing,

335
0:11:53,000 --> 0:11:55,000
 but it's a big harbor city,

336
0:11:55,000 --> 0:11:57,000
 and the,

337
0:11:57,000 --> 0:11:58,000
 well,

338
0:11:58,000 --> 0:12:00,000
 they were promised

339
0:12:00,000 --> 0:12:01,000
 that by 75,

340
0:12:01,000 --> 0:12:02,000
 they would get funding

341
0:12:02,000 --> 0:12:03,000
 for both the university

342
0:12:03,000 --> 0:12:06,000
 and for the data center,

343
0:12:06,000 --> 0:12:08,000
 and as you might already have spotted,

344
0:12:08,000 --> 0:12:09,000
 there was a lot of money

345
0:12:09,000 --> 0:12:10,000
 spread ahead,

346
0:12:10,000 --> 0:12:11,000
 that was denied,

347
0:12:11,000 --> 0:12:12,000
 so this is transformed

348
0:12:12,000 --> 0:12:14,000
 into a general coordination council,

349
0:12:14,000 --> 0:12:15,000
 which would coordinate

350
0:12:15,000 --> 0:12:18,000
 the educational institutions

351
0:12:18,000 --> 0:12:20,000
 in the municipality,

352
0:12:20,000 --> 0:12:24,000
 and help them avoid wasting money

353
0:12:24,000 --> 0:12:27,000
 on this computer stuff,

354
0:12:27,000 --> 0:12:30,000
 and then in 77,

355
0:12:30,000 --> 0:12:32,000
 Mons Pelle discovered,

356
0:12:32,000 --> 0:12:33,000
 no,

357
0:12:33,000 --> 0:12:35,000
 Berg Christensen discovered Mons Pelle,

358
0:12:35,000 --> 0:12:37,000
 and bought this computer from him,

359
0:12:37,000 --> 0:12:39,000
 and then the Southern University Center

360
0:12:39,000 --> 0:12:41,000
 more or less took over the project,

361
0:12:41,000 --> 0:12:43,000
 so if you read Børsen,

362
0:12:43,000 --> 0:12:45,000
 Børsen is a Danish newspaper

363
0:12:45,000 --> 0:12:47,000
 for business interested people,

364
0:12:47,000 --> 0:12:48,000
 or Jyllands Posten,

365
0:12:48,000 --> 0:12:49,000
 which is,

366
0:12:49,000 --> 0:12:50,000
 yeah,

367
0:12:50,000 --> 0:12:51,000
 all the major newspapers,

368
0:12:51,000 --> 0:12:53,000
 they talked about this machine,

369
0:12:53,000 --> 0:12:56,000
 and they called it the SUC computer,

370
0:12:56,000 --> 0:12:59,000
 and it was called the people's computer,

371
0:12:59,000 --> 0:13:01,000
 because it was built to be cheap,

372
0:13:01,000 --> 0:13:02,000
 and was built,

373
0:13:02,000 --> 0:13:03,000
 you could freely build it yourself,

374
0:13:03,000 --> 0:13:05,000
 and the idea was that you wanted

375
0:13:05,000 --> 0:13:07,000
 to provide ordinary people,

376
0:13:07,000 --> 0:13:08,000
 with computers,

377
0:13:08,000 --> 0:13:10,000
 which is something,

378
0:13:10,000 --> 0:13:11,000
 yeah,

379
0:13:11,000 --> 0:13:12,000
 well,

380
0:13:12,000 --> 0:13:13,000
 that was an idea

381
0:13:13,000 --> 0:13:14,000
 that got very popular

382
0:13:14,000 --> 0:13:15,000
 like 10,

383
0:13:15,000 --> 0:13:16,000
 15 years later,

384
0:13:16,000 --> 0:13:17,000
 mainly by,

385
0:13:17,000 --> 0:13:20,000
 pushed by a guy named Bill Gates,

386
0:13:20,000 --> 0:13:22,000
 so they were a bit ahead,

387
0:13:22,000 --> 0:13:23,000
 but,

388
0:13:23,000 --> 0:13:24,000
 yeah,

389
0:13:24,000 --> 0:13:26,000
 so the idea was that

390
0:13:26,000 --> 0:13:30,000
 the SUC funded this prototype,

391
0:13:30,000 --> 0:13:32,000
 which Berg Christensen

392
0:13:32,000 --> 0:13:34,000
 then bought from Mons Pelle,

393
0:13:34,000 --> 0:13:35,000
 and then he was like,

394
0:13:35,000 --> 0:13:36,000
 I need some software for it,

395
0:13:36,000 --> 0:13:38,000
 so he also got some money

396
0:13:38,000 --> 0:13:39,000
 to develop some software,

397
0:13:39,000 --> 0:13:44,000
 and if you read in 1979,

398
0:13:44,000 --> 0:13:45,000
 when this machine was about

399
0:13:45,000 --> 0:13:46,000
 to be published,

400
0:13:46,000 --> 0:13:49,000
 everybody said that this was supposed

401
0:13:49,000 --> 0:13:51,000
 to be sold under the name

402
0:13:51,000 --> 0:13:53,000
 of SUC Data Maiden,

403
0:13:53,000 --> 0:13:55,000
 it didn't happen like that,

404
0:13:55,000 --> 0:13:57,000
 but,

405
0:13:57,000 --> 0:13:58,000
 and then,

406
0:13:58,000 --> 0:14:00,000
 and I'm going to jump a bit again,

407
0:14:00,000 --> 0:14:01,000
 because I need some more,

408
0:14:01,000 --> 0:14:02,000
 what do you call that,

409
0:14:02,000 --> 0:14:04,000
 prehistory,

410
0:14:04,000 --> 0:14:05,000
 what's that,

411
0:14:05,000 --> 0:14:06,000
 history,

412
0:14:06,000 --> 0:14:07,000
 background history,

413
0:14:07,000 --> 0:14:08,000
 so,

414
0:14:08,000 --> 0:14:10,000
 I mentioned that this

415
0:14:10,000 --> 0:14:12,000
 thing got that popular,

416
0:14:12,000 --> 0:14:13,000
 that school just said,

417
0:14:13,000 --> 0:14:15,000
 we need this,

418
0:14:15,000 --> 0:14:16,000
 and then,

419
0:14:16,000 --> 0:14:17,000
 like,

420
0:14:17,000 --> 0:14:19,000
 one and a half month ago,

421
0:14:19,000 --> 0:14:22,000
 a dude in Jutland died,

422
0:14:22,000 --> 0:14:24,000
 and one of his friends called me,

423
0:14:24,000 --> 0:14:26,000
 because he knew that I might be interested

424
0:14:26,000 --> 0:14:28,000
 in some of his old computers,

425
0:14:28,000 --> 0:14:30,000
 I'm really sad he didn't call me

426
0:14:30,000 --> 0:14:31,000
 half a year ago before he died,

427
0:14:31,000 --> 0:14:32,000
 but,

428
0:14:32,000 --> 0:14:33,000
 yeah,

429
0:14:33,000 --> 0:14:34,000
 you can't win every time,

430
0:14:34,000 --> 0:14:35,000
 however,

431
0:14:35,000 --> 0:14:37,000
 I worked in

432
0:14:39,000 --> 0:14:41,000
 Ribe County,

433
0:14:41,000 --> 0:14:43,000
 or Ribe Amt,

434
0:14:43,000 --> 0:14:45,000
 department for purchasing

435
0:14:45,000 --> 0:14:47,000
 educational materials,

436
0:14:47,000 --> 0:14:50,000
 and in,

437
0:14:50,000 --> 0:14:51,000
 so,

438
0:14:51,000 --> 0:14:52,000
 back in 78,

439
0:14:52,000 --> 0:14:53,000
 they founded this committee,

440
0:14:53,000 --> 0:14:54,000
 and said,

441
0:14:54,000 --> 0:14:56,000
 Ribe Amt needs to buy some computers

442
0:14:56,000 --> 0:14:58,000
 for education,

443
0:14:58,000 --> 0:15:00,000
 so they requested

444
0:15:00,000 --> 0:15:03,000
 which is the Danish version of ICL,

445
0:15:03,000 --> 0:15:04,000
 and they requested ICL,

446
0:15:04,000 --> 0:15:07,000
 which is the British version of Reinecentral,

447
0:15:07,000 --> 0:15:08,000
 Data General,

448
0:15:08,000 --> 0:15:11,000
 and some other large manufacturers,

449
0:15:11,000 --> 0:15:13,000
 and also they visited some of them,

450
0:15:13,000 --> 0:15:15,000
 so they flew to Copenhagen,

451
0:15:15,000 --> 0:15:17,000
 and to Great Britain,

452
0:15:17,000 --> 0:15:19,000
 and saw some of these machines

453
0:15:19,000 --> 0:15:20,000
 in use,

454
0:15:20,000 --> 0:15:21,000
 and at this point,

455
0:15:21,000 --> 0:15:23,000
 we were talking about,

456
0:15:23,000 --> 0:15:24,000
 yeah,

457
0:15:24,000 --> 0:15:25,000
 so the committee said,

458
0:15:25,000 --> 0:15:26,000
 we want Kummel,

459
0:15:26,000 --> 0:15:28,000
 and we want microcomputers.

460
0:15:28,000 --> 0:15:30,000
 Do I need to tell you?

461
0:15:30,000 --> 0:15:32,000
 Probably I do,

462
0:15:32,000 --> 0:15:33,000
 so back in the,

463
0:15:33,000 --> 0:15:36,000
 back before the PCs,

464
0:15:36,000 --> 0:15:38,000
 when we talked about computers,

465
0:15:38,000 --> 0:15:40,000
 a computer would typically be a system

466
0:15:40,000 --> 0:15:43,000
 that would require its own building,

467
0:15:43,000 --> 0:15:46,000
 and a minicomputer would be a computer

468
0:15:46,000 --> 0:15:47,000
 that you could fit inside

469
0:15:47,000 --> 0:15:49,000
 one or two small closets,

470
0:15:49,000 --> 0:15:52,000
 and a microcomputer would be something like,

471
0:15:54,000 --> 0:15:55,000
 like this,

472
0:15:55,000 --> 0:15:57,000
 that you could have,

473
0:15:57,000 --> 0:15:58,000
 okay,

474
0:15:58,000 --> 0:15:59,000
 this one,

475
0:15:59,000 --> 0:16:00,000
 that you could have on your own disk,

476
0:16:00,000 --> 0:16:02,000
 so this was a microcomputer.

477
0:16:02,000 --> 0:16:05,000
 What you would probably call a computer back then,

478
0:16:05,000 --> 0:16:08,000
 we would most likely call that a data center,

479
0:16:08,000 --> 0:16:09,000
 because that is,

480
0:16:09,000 --> 0:16:11,000
 that is five or six,

481
0:16:11,000 --> 0:16:13,000
 at least five or six racks of equipment,

482
0:16:13,000 --> 0:16:14,000
 and readers,

483
0:16:14,000 --> 0:16:15,000
 and really,

484
0:16:15,000 --> 0:16:16,000
 really huge,

485
0:16:16,000 --> 0:16:17,000
 and we,

486
0:16:17,000 --> 0:16:20,000
 some of the offers they got were for one and a half million

487
0:16:20,000 --> 0:16:21,000
 crores,

488
0:16:21,000 --> 0:16:23,000
 divided by seven for euros.

489
0:16:23,000 --> 0:16:26,000
 Yeah,

490
0:16:26,000 --> 0:16:28,000
 so said,

491
0:16:28,000 --> 0:16:29,000
 well,

492
0:16:29,000 --> 0:16:30,000
 we hear you,

493
0:16:30,000 --> 0:16:31,000
 you want Kummel,

494
0:16:31,000 --> 0:16:32,000
 you want to buy a computer,

495
0:16:32,000 --> 0:16:33,000
 well,

496
0:16:33,000 --> 0:16:34,000
 you can have a mainframe.

497
0:16:34,000 --> 0:16:35,000
 ECL was like,

498
0:16:35,000 --> 0:16:36,000
 well,

499
0:16:36,000 --> 0:16:37,000
 Kummel,

500
0:16:37,000 --> 0:16:38,000
 no,

501
0:16:38,000 --> 0:16:39,000
 we have this obscure thing we made ourselves

502
0:16:39,000 --> 0:16:40,000
 that nobody likes,

503
0:16:40,000 --> 0:16:42,000
 and a mainframe.

504
0:16:42,000 --> 0:16:43,000
 So,

505
0:16:43,000 --> 0:16:44,000
 I say,

506
0:16:44,000 --> 0:16:45,000
 said,

507
0:16:45,000 --> 0:16:46,000
 oh,

508
0:16:46,000 --> 0:16:47,000
 well,

509
0:16:47,000 --> 0:16:48,000
 by the way,

510
0:16:48,000 --> 0:16:49,000
 we found this guy called Mons Pelle and Bero Christensen,

511
0:16:49,000 --> 0:16:50,000
 and they have built this computer,

512
0:16:50,000 --> 0:16:52,000
 and now we are selling that for them.

513
0:16:52,000 --> 0:16:53,000
 They said that in the,

514
0:16:53,000 --> 0:16:55,000
 in the fall of 1979,

515
0:16:55,000 --> 0:16:57,000
 and only two weeks later,

516
0:16:57,000 --> 0:16:59,000
 Reiner Strahlen went back and said,

517
0:16:59,000 --> 0:17:00,000
 no,

518
0:17:00,000 --> 0:17:01,000
 we don't want to sell that anyway,

519
0:17:01,000 --> 0:17:04,000
 but we are going to build our own microcomputer,

520
0:17:04,000 --> 0:17:07,000
 which will cost the same as a mainframe,

521
0:17:07,000 --> 0:17:10,000
 but can only be used by one person.

522
0:17:10,000 --> 0:17:12,000
 That was a really good offer.

523
0:17:12,000 --> 0:17:13,000
 Surprisingly,

524
0:17:13,000 --> 0:17:14,000
 surprisingly,

525
0:17:14,000 --> 0:17:15,000
 like 14 days,

526
0:17:15,000 --> 0:17:16,000
 no,

527
0:17:16,000 --> 0:17:17,000
 actually,

528
0:17:17,000 --> 0:17:20,000
 I got the two messages from so-called Telex,

529
0:17:20,000 --> 0:17:22,000
 which was the email of the day,

530
0:17:22,000 --> 0:17:23,000
 and,

531
0:17:23,000 --> 0:17:25,000
 and there are hours in difference from when,

532
0:17:25,000 --> 0:17:27,000
 when they received the message from Reiner Strahlen

533
0:17:27,000 --> 0:17:29,000
 and the message from ICL.

534
0:17:29,000 --> 0:17:30,000
 So it was,

535
0:17:30,000 --> 0:17:32,000
 either it was the same day or the day after.

536
0:17:32,000 --> 0:17:33,000
 So very,

537
0:17:33,000 --> 0:17:34,000
 very close.

538
0:17:34,000 --> 0:17:35,000
 ICL comes back and say,

539
0:17:35,000 --> 0:17:38,000
 now we sell the computer that Mons Pelle and,

540
0:17:38,000 --> 0:17:44,000
 and Bero Christensen is selling.

541
0:17:44,000 --> 0:17:45,000
 So that,

542
0:17:45,000 --> 0:17:46,000
 that's a bit back and forth,

543
0:17:46,000 --> 0:17:47,000
 but all in all,

544
0:17:47,000 --> 0:17:50,000
 it ended up that ICL would be the computer,

545
0:17:50,000 --> 0:17:54,000
 be the manufacturing company who sold this machine.

546
0:17:54,000 --> 0:17:57,000
 So we started with this company called,

547
0:17:57,000 --> 0:17:58,000
 called Metanic.

548
0:17:58,000 --> 0:18:00,000
 And if you,

549
0:18:00,000 --> 0:18:01,000
 it's right here.

550
0:18:01,000 --> 0:18:02,000
 And if you notice,

551
0:18:02,000 --> 0:18:07,000
 it's probably now I need to mention that Bero Christensen is not on this picture.

552
0:18:07,000 --> 0:18:13,000
 Bero Christensen really did not want to be a part of the public story because he was just like this,

553
0:18:13,000 --> 0:18:15,000
 a bit of a hippie type and a commercial,

554
0:18:15,000 --> 0:18:17,000
 commercial companies were a bit yucky.

555
0:18:17,000 --> 0:18:22,000
 And actually Bersen wrote that Bero Christensen was part of that.

556
0:18:22,000 --> 0:18:25,000
 And I think one or two days later,

557
0:18:25,000 --> 0:18:27,000
 there was a message in Bersen saying,

558
0:18:27,000 --> 0:18:28,000
 oh,

559
0:18:28,000 --> 0:18:29,000
 we didn't mean that.

560
0:18:29,000 --> 0:18:30,000
 It was a mistake.

561
0:18:30,000 --> 0:18:31,000
 And I mean,

562
0:18:31,000 --> 0:18:32,000
 they don't do that by themselves.

563
0:18:32,000 --> 0:18:33,000
 Some,

564
0:18:33,000 --> 0:18:35,000
 somebody called them and yelled at them for saying it.

565
0:18:35,000 --> 0:18:36,000
 So,

566
0:18:36,000 --> 0:18:41,000
 so I'm sure he was very eager by not getting commercially associated with this project

567
0:18:41,000 --> 0:18:47,000
 because he wanted to use his contacts in academia without him being accused of wanting to make a buck on it.

568
0:18:47,000 --> 0:18:48,000
 That's my theory.

569
0:18:48,000 --> 0:18:50,000
 I can't prove it because the guy is dead,

570
0:18:50,000 --> 0:18:51,000
 but I have,

571
0:18:51,000 --> 0:18:53,000
 I have a lot of,

572
0:18:53,000 --> 0:18:54,000
 uh,

573
0:18:54,000 --> 0:18:55,000
 indicia for that.

574
0:18:55,000 --> 0:18:56,000
 What is that called?

575
0:18:57,000 --> 0:18:58,000
 So,

576
0:18:58,000 --> 0:18:59,000
 you know,

577
0:18:59,000 --> 0:19:01,000
 not circumstantial evidence that points to that.

578
0:19:01,000 --> 0:19:02,000
 Yeah.

579
0:19:02,000 --> 0:19:03,000
 Okay.

580
0:19:03,000 --> 0:19:04,000
 So,

581
0:19:04,000 --> 0:19:05,000
 um,

582
0:19:05,000 --> 0:19:06,000
 I put Reinenstrahlen in there because,

583
0:19:06,000 --> 0:19:07,000
 um,

584
0:19:07,000 --> 0:19:08,000
 yeah,

585
0:19:08,000 --> 0:19:15,000
 a lot of people mistake this and thinks that Reinenstrahlen made this computer and that is wrong,

586
0:19:15,000 --> 0:19:17,000
 but it could have been true.

587
0:19:17,000 --> 0:19:18,000
 And that's fun.

588
0:19:18,000 --> 0:19:19,000
 That's a fun,

589
0:19:19,000 --> 0:19:20,000
 uh,

590
0:19:20,000 --> 0:19:21,000
 fun fact,

591
0:19:21,000 --> 0:19:22,000
 I think.

592
0:19:22,000 --> 0:19:23,000
 So,

593
0:19:23,000 --> 0:19:24,000
 um,

594
0:19:24,000 --> 0:19:25,000
 in Horsens,

595
0:19:25,000 --> 0:19:26,000
 and I'm probably going to make a whole chapter about this in the book alone.

596
0:19:26,000 --> 0:19:27,000
 In Horsens,

597
0:19:27,000 --> 0:19:28,000
 back in the,

598
0:19:28,000 --> 0:19:29,000
 um,

599
0:19:29,000 --> 0:19:30,000
 in the 70s,

600
0:19:30,000 --> 0:19:31,000
 there was this huge television factory.

601
0:19:31,000 --> 0:19:32,000
 Actually,

602
0:19:32,000 --> 0:19:33,000
 it started out like a bicycle factory.

603
0:19:33,000 --> 0:19:36,000
 They also did chemicals and lots of other stuff,

604
0:19:36,000 --> 0:19:39,000
 but they had a department for building televisions and radios,

605
0:19:39,000 --> 0:19:41,000
 which burned down in the late 60s,

606
0:19:41,000 --> 0:19:42,000
 like,

607
0:19:42,000 --> 0:19:43,000
 69,

608
0:19:43,000 --> 0:19:44,000
 I think,

609
0:19:44,000 --> 0:19:45,000
 70,

610
0:19:45,000 --> 0:19:46,000
 around there.

611
0:19:46,000 --> 0:19:47,000
 All these details will,

612
0:19:47,000 --> 0:19:48,000
 of course,

613
0:19:48,000 --> 0:19:49,000
 be in the book,

614
0:19:49,000 --> 0:19:50,000
 by the books.

615
0:19:50,000 --> 0:19:51,000
 There's a link in the,

616
0:19:51,000 --> 0:19:52,000
 in the bottom of the screen slides.

617
0:19:52,000 --> 0:19:53,000
 Um,

618
0:19:53,000 --> 0:19:54,000
 and,

619
0:19:54,000 --> 0:19:55,000
 um,

620
0:19:55,000 --> 0:19:56,000
 a Dutch or British,

621
0:19:56,000 --> 0:19:57,000
 uh,

622
0:19:57,000 --> 0:19:58,000
 company,

623
0:19:58,000 --> 0:19:59,000
 a,

624
0:19:59,000 --> 0:20:00,000
 a trans-European company,

625
0:20:00,000 --> 0:20:01,000
 uh,

626
0:20:01,000 --> 0:20:02,000
 decided to,

627
0:20:02,000 --> 0:20:03,000
 to,

628
0:20:03,000 --> 0:20:04,000
 to enter this,

629
0:20:04,000 --> 0:20:05,000
 um,

630
0:20:05,000 --> 0:20:06,000
 this,

631
0:20:06,000 --> 0:20:07,000
 um,

632
0:20:07,000 --> 0:20:08,000
 factory and fund the rebuilding of it.

633
0:20:08,000 --> 0:20:09,000
 And,

634
0:20:09,000 --> 0:20:10,000
 um,

635
0:20:10,000 --> 0:20:11,000
 they went bankrupt in 1975.

636
0:20:11,000 --> 0:20:12,000
 Uh,

637
0:20:12,000 --> 0:20:13,000
 and then they had like,

638
0:20:13,000 --> 0:20:14,000
 I think,

639
0:20:14,000 --> 0:20:15,000
 400 workers,

640
0:20:15,000 --> 0:20:16,000
 uh,

641
0:20:16,000 --> 0:20:17,000
 in this,

642
0:20:17,000 --> 0:20:18,000
 um,

643
0:20:18,000 --> 0:20:19,000
 part of the company.

644
0:20:19,000 --> 0:20:20,000
 And they were just like,

645
0:20:20,000 --> 0:20:21,000
 well,

646
0:20:21,000 --> 0:20:22,000
 if this international company can do this,

647
0:20:22,000 --> 0:20:23,000
 sure,

648
0:20:23,000 --> 0:20:24,000
 we can do it ourselves.

649
0:20:24,000 --> 0:20:25,000
 So,

650
0:20:25,000 --> 0:20:26,000
 uh,

651
0:20:26,000 --> 0:20:27,000
 the,

652
0:20:27,000 --> 0:20:28,000
 the,

653
0:20:28,000 --> 0:20:29,000
 the estate,

654
0:20:29,000 --> 0:20:30,000
 can you say that about a company?

655
0:20:30,000 --> 0:20:31,000
 I'm not sure.

656
0:20:31,000 --> 0:20:32,000
 Um,

657
0:20:32,000 --> 0:20:33,000
 anyway,

658
0:20:33,000 --> 0:20:34,000
 so,

659
0:20:34,000 --> 0:20:35,000
 so,

660
0:20:35,000 --> 0:20:36,000
 so,

661
0:20:36,000 --> 0:20:37,000
 so,

662
0:20:37,000 --> 0:20:38,000
 so they took over the company.

663
0:20:38,000 --> 0:20:39,000
 This was a huge story.

664
0:20:39,000 --> 0:20:40,000
 They got the municipality to pay some of it.

665
0:20:40,000 --> 0:20:41,000
 Uh,

666
0:20:41,000 --> 0:20:42,000
 uh,

667
0:20:42,000 --> 0:20:43,000
 lot of it.

668
0:20:43,000 --> 0:20:44,000
 They made,

669
0:20:44,000 --> 0:20:45,000
 uh,

670
0:20:45,000 --> 0:20:46,000
 like stocks you could sell to,

671
0:20:46,000 --> 0:20:47,000
 uh,

672
0:20:47,000 --> 0:20:48,000
 or,

673
0:20:48,000 --> 0:20:49,000
 it's called the people stocks,

674
0:20:49,000 --> 0:20:50,000
 .

675
0:20:50,000 --> 0:20:51,000
 So,

676
0:20:51,000 --> 0:20:52,000
 so it was a huge deal,

677
0:20:52,000 --> 0:20:53,000
 uh,

678
0:20:53,000 --> 0:20:54,000
 with publicity and,

679
0:20:54,000 --> 0:20:55,000
 and,

680
0:20:55,000 --> 0:20:56,000
 the,

681
0:20:56,000 --> 0:20:57,000
 uh,

682
0:20:57,000 --> 0:20:58,000
 most people who released a few hundred shares by the time,

683
0:20:58,000 --> 0:20:59,000
 bought,

684
0:20:59,000 --> 0:21:00,000
 uh,

685
0:21:00,000 --> 0:21:01,000
 the majority of the shares in the company,

686
0:21:01,000 --> 0:21:02,000
 and kept it afloat for,

687
0:21:02,000 --> 0:21:03,000
 uh,

688
0:21:03,000 --> 0:21:04,000
 until,

689
0:21:04,000 --> 0:21:05,000
 uh,

690
0:21:05,000 --> 0:21:06,000
 1979.

691
0:21:06,000 --> 0:21:07,000
 Um,

692
0:21:07,000 --> 0:21:08,000
 but,

693
0:21:08,000 --> 0:21:09,000
 the,

694
0:21:09,000 --> 0:21:10,000
 the,

695
0:21:10,000 --> 0:21:11,000
 the,

696
0:21:11,000 --> 0:21:12,000
 the vibe of the people's television factory was still there,

697
0:21:12,000 --> 0:21:13,000
 and they tried to use that to market the computer as the people's computer.

698
0:21:13,000 --> 0:21:14,000
 But,

699
0:21:14,000 --> 0:21:15,000
 it didn't go,

700
0:21:15,000 --> 0:21:16,000
 3F went,

701
0:21:16,000 --> 0:21:17,000
 uh,

702
0:21:17,000 --> 0:21:18,000
 bankrupt.

703
0:21:18,000 --> 0:21:19,000
 And they went bankrupt,

704
0:21:19,000 --> 0:21:20,000
 like months before they had promised to deliver these machines.

705
0:21:20,000 --> 0:21:21,000
 Um,

706
0:21:21,000 --> 0:21:22,000
 and there are a couple of machines which had,

707
0:21:22,000 --> 0:21:23,000
 uh,

708
0:21:23,000 --> 0:21:27,000
 a couple of machines that were built at this point, but we don't know who built them.

709
0:21:27,000 --> 0:21:31,760
 I have talked to Mons Pele and he doesn't remember what he had for breakfast last day.

710
0:21:31,760 --> 0:21:36,520
 So that's, by the way, that's his own words, I'm not mugging him anyway.

711
0:21:36,520 --> 0:21:38,760
 He really has a bad memory.

712
0:21:38,760 --> 0:21:44,080
 So we're trying to jolt his memory by showing him, yeah, everything I come up with I send

713
0:21:44,080 --> 0:21:46,160
 to him and he says, oh, yeah, I remember that.

714
0:21:46,160 --> 0:21:48,800
 And then slowly we get the memories back from him.

715
0:21:48,800 --> 0:21:51,460
 But he doesn't recall where these machines were built.

716
0:21:51,460 --> 0:21:57,140
 The best I got from him was like that, oh, yeah, I might have built them myself.

717
0:21:57,140 --> 0:22:02,580
 Which is possible because we are talking about somewhere between 30 and 50 machines.

718
0:22:02,580 --> 0:22:07,440
 You can build that in a couple of months, maybe hire a couple of young ones to help

719
0:22:07,440 --> 0:22:08,440
 you.

720
0:22:08,440 --> 0:22:14,540
 So we have another example of a young guy who built 400 machines with his wife at the

721
0:22:14,540 --> 0:22:18,660
 kitchen table and sold them to institutions in all of Finland.

722
0:22:18,660 --> 0:22:21,460
 So it has happened before, so it could have happened.

723
0:22:21,460 --> 0:22:28,060
 So they shipped these machines off to another factory they found in northern Zeeland, which

724
0:22:28,060 --> 0:22:30,340
 started the production.

725
0:22:30,340 --> 0:22:37,140
 And that ended up being what was called the ICL, Comet MPS 2000.

726
0:22:37,140 --> 0:22:42,040
 And just to put Komal back in there, then the same company who built the machine actually

727
0:22:42,040 --> 0:22:47,460
 started developing the first version of Komal for the Z80-based machines.

728
0:22:47,460 --> 0:22:50,140
 So we still have Komal tagging in here.

729
0:22:50,140 --> 0:22:51,340
 And Metanic was designed.

730
0:22:51,460 --> 0:22:53,400
 He was designing the hardware but not building it.

731
0:22:53,400 --> 0:22:55,900
 But he was also designing the software.

732
0:22:55,900 --> 0:23:00,660
 So this Mons Pelle dude was trying to be the intellectual master without having to do the

733
0:23:00,660 --> 0:23:06,420
 actual work, which in theory was a good idea, only in theory.

734
0:23:06,420 --> 0:23:17,140
 So the machine, we think there were made about 200 of them, running with a Zilac Z80 CPU of

735
0:23:17,140 --> 0:23:19,780
 1 megahertz and 4 kilobytes of memory.

736
0:23:19,780 --> 0:23:20,780
 And they used a tape.

737
0:23:20,780 --> 0:23:21,220
 Do you remember?

738
0:23:21,220 --> 0:23:27,540
 Do you remember these small tapes from we used in the 90s for voice answering machines?

739
0:23:27,540 --> 0:23:33,620
 Or for those, you know, the doctor would speak into a thing to make notes, the dictaphone?

740
0:23:33,620 --> 0:23:35,460
 Do you remember those?

741
0:23:35,460 --> 0:23:36,900
 They used those for data.

742
0:23:36,900 --> 0:23:42,940
 They could cram 128 kilobytes of data into one of these machines.

743
0:23:42,940 --> 0:23:47,940
 Impressive.

744
0:23:47,940 --> 0:23:50,160
 And they lived happily ever after.

745
0:23:50,160 --> 0:23:51,060
 Of course they didn't.

746
0:23:51,220 --> 0:23:55,160
 Because this is IT.

747
0:23:55,160 --> 0:23:58,040
 You have to have people not lagging each other.

748
0:23:58,040 --> 0:24:03,540
 So I'm going to talk a bit about HH Electronic, which was the company who took over the production

749
0:24:03,540 --> 0:24:04,860
 of the machines.

750
0:24:04,860 --> 0:24:08,100
 This company was founded in 1976.

751
0:24:08,100 --> 0:24:13,600
 And it didn't stop in 1980, but that's where I'm stopping for this chapter.

752
0:24:13,600 --> 0:24:17,620
 So the company was founded by a young engineer.

753
0:24:17,620 --> 0:24:19,220
 Actually they sprung out of a company who made gas engines.

754
0:24:19,220 --> 0:24:20,220
 And this was the first company to do that.

755
0:24:20,220 --> 0:24:21,220
 And this was the first company to do that.

756
0:24:21,220 --> 0:24:22,220
 And he was like, can you buy gas systems?

757
0:24:22,220 --> 0:24:25,600
 So, like, regulators and stuff like that.

758
0:24:25,600 --> 0:24:30,540
 And the boss of that company asked him to say, can you buy, can you, now, sorry, can

759
0:24:30,540 --> 0:24:33,040
 you develop a process control system for us?

760
0:24:33,040 --> 0:24:35,620
 And he was just like, yeah, I can do that.

761
0:24:35,620 --> 0:24:44,180
 So he also got his hand on a Z80 processor and built a Z80 based process control platform.

762
0:24:44,180 --> 0:24:51,060
 And in 1978, he announced in Børsen, again, the same magazine as we talked about before,

763
0:24:51,220 --> 0:24:56,380
 that he had developed a version of BASIC, which were more structured than BASIC, and

764
0:24:56,380 --> 0:24:58,940
 called it HH BASIC.

765
0:24:58,940 --> 0:25:04,680
 And news like that, you can publish that in a local, in a global, what is it called?

766
0:25:04,680 --> 0:25:09,460
 In a countrywide Danish paper without Børs Kristensen noticing.

767
0:25:09,460 --> 0:25:16,760
 So in 1978, Børs Kristensen called AHS Electronic and got to talk with them about their BASIC.

768
0:25:16,760 --> 0:25:19,220
 So that was how the connection was made.

769
0:25:19,220 --> 0:25:20,220
 Oh, and I'm sorry.

770
0:25:20,220 --> 0:25:21,220
 Sorry.

771
0:25:21,220 --> 0:25:24,220
 Actually, it was in 1979.

772
0:25:24,220 --> 0:25:25,220
 It says here.

773
0:25:25,220 --> 0:25:28,220
 So probably right.

774
0:25:28,220 --> 0:25:29,580
 Yeah.

775
0:25:29,580 --> 0:25:35,040
 So this machine wasn't really usable, mainly because it took 20 minutes to load the tape

776
0:25:35,040 --> 0:25:38,980
 with 128 kilobytes of memory, of program.

777
0:25:38,980 --> 0:25:43,460
 So imagine you're having a class, and you need to teach them COMAL.

778
0:25:43,460 --> 0:25:45,600
 And you've got four machines.

779
0:25:45,600 --> 0:25:48,720
 And each machine, there are four students around each machine.

780
0:25:48,720 --> 0:25:50,760
 And they start at 8 o'clock.

781
0:25:50,760 --> 0:25:53,320
 And they start with loading the tape, and they wait 20 minutes.

782
0:25:53,320 --> 0:25:57,020
 And then two of the machines breaks down and needs to be restarted.

783
0:25:57,020 --> 0:26:00,060
 So now the class is over.

784
0:26:00,060 --> 0:26:01,060
 That wasn't...

785
0:26:01,060 --> 0:26:03,460
 Yeah, they didn't like that.

786
0:26:03,460 --> 0:26:07,080
 So Jørgen Høgh went to ICL and said, you know what?

787
0:26:07,080 --> 0:26:12,740
 I like this idea with these computers, but I don't like this most .

788
0:26:12,740 --> 0:26:17,760
 So either I'm leaving, and you can keep your system, or we are going to make a new computer,

789
0:26:17,760 --> 0:26:18,760
 and you can keep your system, and you can keep your system, and you can keep your system,

790
0:26:18,760 --> 0:26:19,760
 or we are going to make a new computer.

791
0:26:19,760 --> 0:26:25,800
 And we are going to make a new computer based on our process control system, and is leaving.

792
0:26:25,800 --> 0:26:31,800
 And ICL had, at this point, been fighting for almost two years to find a factory that

793
0:26:31,800 --> 0:26:32,940
 could produce these machines.

794
0:26:32,940 --> 0:26:38,180
 So ICL was just like, well, are we going with the guy who had all these crazy ideas and

795
0:26:38,180 --> 0:26:39,520
 couldn't put them into life?

796
0:26:39,520 --> 0:26:45,620
 Or with this guy who actually put these crazy ideas into reality, but now want to scale

797
0:26:45,620 --> 0:26:46,740
 a little bit back?

798
0:26:46,740 --> 0:26:48,960
 So they, of course, went with HH-Electronic.

799
0:26:49,760 --> 0:26:52,840
 And they developed the MPS3000.

800
0:26:52,840 --> 0:26:56,260
 And the MPS2000 was dropped, or phased out slowly.

801
0:26:56,260 --> 0:27:06,780
 A funny story about this was that nobody remembered to tell Mons Pelle that.

802
0:27:06,780 --> 0:27:14,480
 So he didn't know until around 1980, the spring 1980, when he went to this factory and wanted

803
0:27:14,480 --> 0:27:15,760
 to pick up his check.

804
0:27:15,760 --> 0:27:16,960
 So how many computers have you made?

805
0:27:16,960 --> 0:27:17,760
 And can I please have my check?

806
0:27:17,760 --> 0:27:18,760
 And he was just like, we didn't make it.

807
0:27:18,760 --> 0:27:19,760
 And he was like, we didn't make it.

808
0:27:19,760 --> 0:27:21,720
 Any computers, you can't have any check.

809
0:27:22,000 --> 0:27:23,200
 We are doing it ourselves now.

810
0:27:25,340 --> 0:27:28,520
 So that's not a good way to...

811
0:27:28,520 --> 0:27:30,500
 Well, it could have been done smarter.

812
0:27:31,020 --> 0:27:32,640
 More about that during the next slide.

813
0:27:33,500 --> 0:27:36,620
 We made this machine, and this is what most of...

814
0:27:36,620 --> 0:27:37,000
 Ah, okay.

815
0:27:37,400 --> 0:27:40,740
 Most Danish guys in my dad's age

816
0:27:40,740 --> 0:27:44,120
 would probably have seen in the school.

817
0:27:44,120 --> 0:27:46,820
 That would be this orange case

818
0:27:46,820 --> 0:27:52,300
 made out of 1.5 millimeter steel plate.

819
0:27:54,180 --> 0:27:59,120
 And, well, today you would probably not be allowed

820
0:27:59,120 --> 0:28:02,320
 to move this by the government

821
0:28:02,320 --> 0:28:04,360
 because health and safety risks.

822
0:28:04,580 --> 0:28:05,760
 It's really, really heavy.

823
0:28:06,480 --> 0:28:11,120
 And its power supply is...

824
0:28:11,640 --> 0:28:14,760
 Yeah, well, you don't touch the cabinet on the back

825
0:28:14,760 --> 0:28:15,460
 when it's turned on.

826
0:28:15,540 --> 0:28:16,800
 You'll burn because it's...

827
0:28:16,800 --> 0:28:17,760
 Really, really, really hot.

828
0:28:18,420 --> 0:28:19,960
 Anyway, the machines became very popular,

829
0:28:20,300 --> 0:28:22,820
 and overall, they were produced

830
0:28:22,820 --> 0:28:24,600
 about 3,000 units of these machines.

831
0:28:25,940 --> 0:28:27,420
 Nothing much to say about that.

832
0:28:28,180 --> 0:28:28,900
 It's...

833
0:28:28,900 --> 0:28:30,580
 Yeah, it was a new beginning.

834
0:28:31,580 --> 0:28:33,060
 But Mons Pelle was just like,

835
0:28:33,320 --> 0:28:35,640
 no, hell no, I don't want to be part of this,

836
0:28:35,980 --> 0:28:37,340
 and they're not going to screw me over.

837
0:28:37,460 --> 0:28:39,560
 So he made a new computer.

838
0:28:40,120 --> 0:28:42,460
 He made the MPS 2001.

839
0:28:43,320 --> 0:28:44,500
 So now you see what's happening

840
0:28:44,500 --> 0:28:46,000
 is we have this first computer,

841
0:28:46,200 --> 0:28:46,700
 and now it's...

842
0:28:46,700 --> 0:28:46,780
 It's a new computer.

843
0:28:46,780 --> 0:28:48,940
 It's forking out into two different machines.

844
0:28:49,240 --> 0:28:50,140
 Which one is the following?

845
0:28:50,360 --> 0:28:52,520
 Which one is number two, if any?

846
0:28:53,180 --> 0:28:54,680
 If you take this machine apart,

847
0:28:55,180 --> 0:28:56,960
 on the motherboard, you will actually see

848
0:28:56,960 --> 0:28:58,400
 it's called MPS 2001.

849
0:28:58,980 --> 0:29:00,720
 However, that's the only place you will see that

850
0:29:00,720 --> 0:29:03,840
 because he partnered up with a bunch of young salesmen

851
0:29:03,840 --> 0:29:06,500
 from the mid-Utlands,

852
0:29:07,280 --> 0:29:09,940
 and those guys could sell.

853
0:29:11,100 --> 0:29:13,380
 So he built this machine.

854
0:29:13,580 --> 0:29:14,720
 Don't know where, don't know how.

855
0:29:15,720 --> 0:29:16,520
 As he said,

856
0:29:16,780 --> 0:29:18,220
 I might have done it myself.

857
0:29:18,220 --> 0:29:21,020
 I really would like to have interviewed this guy

858
0:29:21,020 --> 0:29:22,620
 for 20 years ago, but...

859
0:29:22,620 --> 0:29:27,120
 So, and this machine was built during the same time,

860
0:29:27,120 --> 0:29:28,320
 and if you look at the specs,

861
0:29:28,320 --> 0:29:31,020
 this is a hell of a lot of a faster machine.

862
0:29:31,020 --> 0:29:32,360
 It's four times faster.

863
0:29:32,360 --> 0:29:34,160
 I know four megahertz doesn't have much today,

864
0:29:34,160 --> 0:29:35,840
 but if you're used to one megahertz,

865
0:29:35,840 --> 0:29:37,660
 this is four times as much.

866
0:29:37,660 --> 0:29:40,800
 And if you're used to a system with 48 kilobytes of memory,

867
0:29:40,800 --> 0:29:43,480
 this one goes up to 128 kilobytes of memory.

868
0:29:43,480 --> 0:29:45,840
 The ROM is not included in that.

869
0:29:45,840 --> 0:29:46,680
 We have ROM,

870
0:29:46,680 --> 0:29:51,620
 and on top of that it's all built into one machine

871
0:29:51,620 --> 0:29:53,120
 that would be eight more years

872
0:29:53,120 --> 0:29:55,920
 until ICL would catch up to this.

873
0:29:55,920 --> 0:29:59,120
 So he got it right the second time at least.

874
0:30:01,260 --> 0:30:03,800
 So I'm probably going to go into a bit

875
0:30:03,800 --> 0:30:05,700
 about Bokeh Datasystemer.

876
0:30:05,700 --> 0:30:10,640
 That means Bokeh doesn't mean anything, data systems.

877
0:30:10,640 --> 0:30:14,100
 That was the young guys who sold it,

878
0:30:14,100 --> 0:30:15,940
 and that's a story as well,

879
0:30:15,940 --> 0:30:17,980
 but I'm not going to get into that yet

880
0:30:17,980 --> 0:30:19,920
 because I collected a lot of materials about it,

881
0:30:19,920 --> 0:30:21,080
 but I haven't read it yet.

882
0:30:21,080 --> 0:30:22,240
 I'm not kidding.

883
0:30:22,240 --> 0:30:24,080
 I have an entire shelf,

884
0:30:25,620 --> 0:30:30,620
 one entire IKEA shelf filled with binders and books

885
0:30:31,880 --> 0:30:34,720
 and photocopies and hardware.

886
0:30:36,160 --> 0:30:38,020
 Actually, I have a room full of hardware,

887
0:30:38,020 --> 0:30:40,260
 but I have a lot of material,

888
0:30:40,260 --> 0:30:42,500
 and I haven't gone through it all yet.

889
0:30:42,500 --> 0:30:45,780
 Anyway, this machine was being traded,

890
0:30:45,940 --> 0:30:48,840
 and it was being sold for the next eight years,

891
0:30:48,840 --> 0:30:50,540
 more or less without modifications,

892
0:30:50,540 --> 0:30:53,120
 and it could keep up with ICL,

893
0:30:53,120 --> 0:30:56,180
 which at this point in time was like this huge international,

894
0:30:56,180 --> 0:30:58,420
 it was the IBM of Europe.

895
0:30:59,880 --> 0:31:04,700
 ICL had to improve, so HH Electronics and ICL

896
0:31:04,700 --> 0:31:06,000
 kept on developing.

897
0:31:06,000 --> 0:31:08,960
 As you see now, they got up to four megahertz as well

898
0:31:08,960 --> 0:31:10,760
 and 64 kilobytes of memory.

899
0:31:10,760 --> 0:31:13,360
 They also managed to put in up to one megabyte of memory

900
0:31:13,360 --> 0:31:14,400
 in this machine.

901
0:31:14,400 --> 0:31:15,780
 If you were very rich, one application,

902
0:31:15,780 --> 0:31:15,800
 one computer, one computer, one computer, one computer,

903
0:31:15,800 --> 0:31:18,000
 you could get up to one gigabyte of memory

904
0:31:18,000 --> 0:31:19,200
 in the same machine.

905
0:31:19,200 --> 0:31:21,180
 So the reason of this was that it was used for drawing,

906
0:31:21,180 --> 0:31:24,040
 for CAD diagrams, and you could add up to one megabyte

907
0:31:24,040 --> 0:31:27,000
 of memory into it, and they had a requirement

908
0:31:27,000 --> 0:31:29,520
 that it should be able to contain the entire drawings

909
0:31:29,520 --> 0:31:32,720
 of the Concorde plane, and that took up one megabyte

910
0:31:32,720 --> 0:31:37,020
 of memory, and I think it was about 120,000 Danish krones

911
0:31:37,020 --> 0:31:38,800
 for that megabyte of memory.

912
0:31:38,800 --> 0:31:41,620
 That was insane, and by the way, my dad did that software,

913
0:31:41,620 --> 0:31:45,640
 so he had memory for 120,000 krones in his computer.

914
0:31:45,640 --> 0:31:49,160
 I don't know if we had an insurance for that, but yeah.

915
0:31:49,420 --> 0:31:51,280
 That was when I connected with these computers

916
0:31:51,280 --> 0:31:53,780
 because when I was like, like, like, yay big,

917
0:31:54,020 --> 0:31:56,700
 my dad worked on one of these machines.

918
0:31:57,780 --> 0:31:59,680
 And it has intrigued me ever since.

919
0:31:59,940 --> 0:32:04,400
 I never really get to play with it until I got, like, what's older?

920
0:32:04,740 --> 0:32:06,080
 Well, that's not true.

921
0:32:06,180 --> 0:32:08,580
 When I was yay big, I get to like,

922
0:32:08,660 --> 0:32:10,220
 eh, I'm working on the computer

923
0:32:10,220 --> 0:32:13,600
 because this keyboard was made of, again, sheet metal.

924
0:32:13,600 --> 0:32:16,880
 Well, if something would break by me using that,

925
0:32:17,140 --> 0:32:18,560
 it would be me breaking.

926
0:32:18,800 --> 0:32:19,660
 The computer would not.

927
0:32:20,700 --> 0:32:21,460
 That was for sure.

928
0:32:23,100 --> 0:32:26,000
 This machine, line-of-machine, supported hard drives

929
0:32:26,000 --> 0:32:28,760
 as one of the first in this series.

930
0:32:29,780 --> 0:32:34,940
 So this was more or less the final iteration of the ICL Comet,

931
0:32:35,220 --> 0:32:36,880
 at least in the early years.

932
0:32:37,120 --> 0:32:39,580
 That's not the final, but anyway, for now it's the final.

933
0:32:40,720 --> 0:32:43,580
 But ATS Electronics, they wanted to develop this further

934
0:32:43,680 --> 0:32:47,420
 and they realized that 8-bit computers and CPM

935
0:32:47,720 --> 0:32:51,720
 was probably not going to outlive, yeah,

936
0:32:52,880 --> 0:32:56,120
 it was obvious that it would be,

937
0:32:57,260 --> 0:33:00,940
 that the market would be troubled over by, among else, IBM.

938
0:33:01,340 --> 0:33:04,540
 So they wanted to try to be better than the IBM.

939
0:33:04,920 --> 0:33:08,140
 So they started developing something that I liked really much.

940
0:33:08,600 --> 0:33:10,460
 They started developing a Unix computer.

941
0:33:11,640 --> 0:33:12,920
 Now we are back home again.

942
0:33:12,920 --> 0:33:12,940
 We like it.

943
0:33:12,940 --> 0:33:12,980
 We like it.

944
0:33:12,980 --> 0:33:13,040
 We like it.

945
0:33:13,040 --> 0:33:13,120
 We like it.

946
0:33:13,120 --> 0:33:13,180
 We like it.

947
0:33:13,180 --> 0:33:13,280
 We like it.

948
0:33:13,280 --> 0:33:13,380
 We like it.

949
0:33:13,380 --> 0:33:13,440
 We like it.

950
0:33:13,440 --> 0:33:13,540
 We like it.

951
0:33:13,540 --> 0:33:13,580
 We like it.

952
0:33:13,580 --> 0:33:13,720
 We like it.

953
0:33:13,720 --> 0:33:13,780
 We like it.

954
0:33:13,780 --> 0:33:13,920
 We like it.

955
0:33:13,920 --> 0:33:14,020
 We like it.

956
0:33:14,020 --> 0:33:14,040
 We like it.

957
0:33:14,040 --> 0:33:15,880
 We like Unix machines.

958
0:33:15,880 --> 0:33:23,880
 So this was a 14 megahertz computer,

959
0:33:23,880 --> 0:33:26,860
 with 2 megabytes of memory and 12 megabytes of hard drive,

960
0:33:26,860 --> 0:33:31,060
 which ran a full Unix system.

961
0:33:31,060 --> 0:33:34,800
 Can you run anything on 12 megabytes today?

962
0:33:34,800 --> 0:33:39,680
 Maybe even the Arduino development suite is larger than that.

963
0:33:41,380 --> 0:33:43,140
 And this is actually about the same weight

964
0:33:43,140 --> 0:33:43,380
 and this is actually about the same weight

965
0:33:43,380 --> 0:33:45,920
 the other computers, but there are more stuff in them.

966
0:33:48,920 --> 0:33:52,460
 This was developed in unison with a Swedish company,

967
0:33:52,640 --> 0:33:56,640
 which I'm still investigating, and I have a contact.

968
0:33:57,160 --> 0:34:00,040
 I'm speaking with a few of the workers from over there,

969
0:34:00,400 --> 0:34:02,820
 but I really don't have anything yet.

970
0:34:02,820 --> 0:34:07,680
 But I suspect there's an entire chapter about this machine as well,

971
0:34:08,000 --> 0:34:09,720
 and I have one of these machines.

972
0:34:09,720 --> 0:34:14,680
 By the way, almost all the pictures I've taken myself,

973
0:34:15,160 --> 0:34:17,380
 and I have, except for the Comet 2000,

974
0:34:17,740 --> 0:34:21,740
 I actually have, either I or the Dressing Museum have all the machines.

975
0:34:25,100 --> 0:34:27,400
 This was sold to commerce schools.

976
0:34:29,120 --> 0:34:31,180
 I don't know what they used them for.

977
0:34:31,840 --> 0:34:33,100
 I'd still like to find that out,

978
0:34:33,220 --> 0:34:36,880
 but I actually think there's an entire book in this machine alone

979
0:34:36,880 --> 0:34:39,120
 when I start digging through it.

980
0:34:39,120 --> 0:34:41,860
 So I don't know what will show up, if anything.

981
0:34:42,740 --> 0:34:48,820
 But the Butler machine, when he started selling that in 1981,

982
0:34:49,260 --> 0:34:52,480
 it was actually already prepared to do multi-user setups.

983
0:34:52,860 --> 0:34:55,460
 So you would have one large machine with a floppy drive,

984
0:34:56,040 --> 0:34:58,160
 and you would have five or six terminals

985
0:34:58,160 --> 0:35:01,140
 that would all use the same printer and the same floppy drive.

986
0:35:01,940 --> 0:35:05,340
 So it only took five years for ICL to catch up with that.

987
0:35:06,020 --> 0:35:09,100
 So this machine contains a processor and some memory,

988
0:35:09,800 --> 0:35:12,000
 and it wasn't a dump terminal.

989
0:35:12,180 --> 0:35:13,840
 It was a semi-intelligent terminal

990
0:35:13,840 --> 0:35:17,120
 because it used the hard drive from the central computer,

991
0:35:17,520 --> 0:35:19,860
 but it did all its calculations by itself.

992
0:35:20,440 --> 0:35:22,620
 So I could load my program into memory,

993
0:35:22,760 --> 0:35:24,400
 and I could work on it all day

994
0:35:24,400 --> 0:35:26,320
 without having to wait for the master computer,

995
0:35:26,760 --> 0:35:28,920
 and I would have my own resources.

996
0:35:29,520 --> 0:35:31,140
 That was a pretty clever move.

997
0:35:31,960 --> 0:35:33,640
 I haven't looked into the pricing yet,

998
0:35:33,720 --> 0:35:35,300
 but this was significantly cheaper,

999
0:35:35,680 --> 0:35:38,120
 both because it only had four...

1000
0:35:39,100 --> 0:35:46,280
 These machines were built on something we call Eurocards,

1001
0:35:46,640 --> 0:35:48,460
 which is a print on that size,

1002
0:35:48,920 --> 0:35:50,240
 which has a standard connector,

1003
0:35:50,580 --> 0:35:54,340
 and you have a row of circuits you can just slide them into,

1004
0:35:54,340 --> 0:35:58,140
 and all the connectors are just connected parallel

1005
0:35:58,140 --> 0:35:59,460
 the entire way through.

1006
0:36:00,020 --> 0:36:02,460
 So you can put anything into that you want.

1007
0:36:02,820 --> 0:36:05,040
 And that's a good system

1008
0:36:05,040 --> 0:36:08,460
 because you can get these prints and the racks,

1009
0:36:09,100 --> 0:36:10,000
 ready-made,

1010
0:36:10,580 --> 0:36:13,080
 and that's cheaper than building large prints.

1011
0:36:14,580 --> 0:36:18,240
 And this machine was actually pretty easy for them to develop

1012
0:36:18,240 --> 0:36:21,040
 because you just take the memory card, the CPU card,

1013
0:36:21,080 --> 0:36:24,160
 and then build a card for the remote storage,

1014
0:36:24,840 --> 0:36:28,000
 and then you could start producing these machines.

1015
0:36:29,880 --> 0:36:34,940
 So this was a cheap research and development process,

1016
0:36:34,940 --> 0:36:38,500
 and they now could sell more users per machine,

1017
0:36:38,760 --> 0:36:38,940
 and...

1018
0:36:39,100 --> 0:36:41,560
 the schools could pay less for more workstations,

1019
0:36:42,920 --> 0:36:46,960
 which would be...

1020
0:36:48,520 --> 0:36:49,960
 Yeah, which is a good argument

1021
0:36:49,960 --> 0:36:53,680
 when your competitors are selling machines for 150,000 drones

1022
0:36:53,680 --> 0:36:54,880
 that can be used by one person.

1023
0:36:56,720 --> 0:36:59,380
 Finally, we get to the ICL Combat MPS 8.

1024
0:36:59,880 --> 0:37:03,500
 So this is when ICL caught fully up to the Butler machine.

1025
0:37:03,840 --> 0:37:05,120
 This machine is more or less the same.

1026
0:37:06,820 --> 0:37:09,020
 Everything is built on one board, like on the Butler,

1027
0:37:09,100 --> 0:37:11,760
 and it has this memory switching,

1028
0:37:12,240 --> 0:37:14,160
 and then it had a pretty nice thing.

1029
0:37:14,260 --> 0:37:17,340
 It used a 1.45 megabyte floppy drive.

1030
0:37:17,900 --> 0:37:19,520
 I don't know if you know anything about CPM,

1031
0:37:19,520 --> 0:37:23,600
 but 1.44 megabyte of CPM software.

1032
0:37:24,540 --> 0:37:28,500
 You can almost have every conceivable piece of software

1033
0:37:28,500 --> 0:37:30,500
 made for a CPM machine on one floppy,

1034
0:37:31,120 --> 0:37:34,040
 and that one floppy is like eight times faster

1035
0:37:34,040 --> 0:37:36,440
 than anything else this machine had ever seen.

1036
0:37:36,760 --> 0:37:38,520
 So this was a huge markup,

1037
0:37:39,100 --> 0:37:40,160
 and a huge improvement.

1038
0:37:41,060 --> 0:37:43,860
 The machine also went from costing 30,000 drones a piece

1039
0:37:43,860 --> 0:37:45,520
 to 5,000 drones a piece.

1040
0:37:46,100 --> 0:37:48,920
 So this was really, really, really efficient,

1041
0:37:49,140 --> 0:37:51,100
 but also you can repair it.

1042
0:37:51,260 --> 0:37:52,460
 I got one which is broken

1043
0:37:52,460 --> 0:37:54,920
 because the keyboard's LED has broken off,

1044
0:37:55,180 --> 0:37:56,100
 and you can repair it

1045
0:37:56,100 --> 0:37:59,600
 because the keyboard has been press-fitted

1046
0:37:59,600 --> 0:38:00,540
 and melded together.

1047
0:38:01,280 --> 0:38:02,200
 So, yeah.

1048
0:38:04,160 --> 0:38:05,320
 So this was the...

1049
0:38:05,320 --> 0:38:06,440
 I made a video about this.

1050
0:38:06,520 --> 0:38:08,560
 This was the last Danish 8-bit computer,

1051
0:38:08,740 --> 0:38:09,080
 and when I made it,

1052
0:38:09,080 --> 0:38:09,600
 I made the video.

1053
0:38:09,720 --> 0:38:10,140
 It worked.

1054
0:38:10,220 --> 0:38:11,160
 You can see that on the picture.

1055
0:38:12,080 --> 0:38:14,060
 It's full of tensile capacitors,

1056
0:38:14,180 --> 0:38:15,120
 so it's not working anymore,

1057
0:38:15,660 --> 0:38:18,420
 but we had it working for just a short while,

1058
0:38:18,540 --> 0:38:19,940
 and I'm, of course, going to fix it.

1059
0:38:21,540 --> 0:38:24,360
 But HHS Electronics had realized

1060
0:38:24,360 --> 0:38:29,280
 that this PC thing will take over the market,

1061
0:38:29,820 --> 0:38:33,100
 so they actually stopped developing the machines themselves

1062
0:38:33,100 --> 0:38:36,880
 and was like,

1063
0:38:36,880 --> 0:38:38,720
 again, I'm going to...

1064
0:38:38,720 --> 0:38:43,040
 Yeah, they stopped the development

1065
0:38:43,040 --> 0:38:44,440
 and the sales process themselves

1066
0:38:44,440 --> 0:38:47,720
 and started making PCs.

1067
0:38:49,340 --> 0:38:50,200
 Oh, well, they tried.

1068
0:38:50,860 --> 0:38:56,020
 So they wanted to use Danish as an argument for buying PCs,

1069
0:38:56,680 --> 0:38:59,500
 and they made an expensive design cabinet

1070
0:38:59,500 --> 0:39:01,900
 and built the boards in Denmark

1071
0:39:01,900 --> 0:39:03,660
 and built everything in Denmark

1072
0:39:03,660 --> 0:39:04,880
 and tried to say,

1073
0:39:04,880 --> 0:39:06,180
 this is so much better quality,

1074
0:39:06,380 --> 0:39:07,880
 but it wasn't because...

1075
0:39:08,720 --> 0:39:13,960
 Yeah, maybe the Chinese factory does it twice as bad,

1076
0:39:14,180 --> 0:39:16,440
 but they can make four in the time you make one,

1077
0:39:16,600 --> 0:39:20,480
 so, yeah, I think I talked to the guy.

1078
0:39:20,580 --> 0:39:21,880
 I think he made 20 of them,

1079
0:39:21,960 --> 0:39:23,380
 so it wasn't really a thing.

1080
0:39:25,140 --> 0:39:26,480
 This is more or less the story.

1081
0:39:27,380 --> 0:39:29,300
 I'm going to finish off with a chapter

1082
0:39:29,300 --> 0:39:33,660
 where I'm going to quickly run through what happens.

1083
0:39:33,660 --> 0:39:36,640
 The IBM PC was launched in 1981,

1084
0:39:37,300 --> 0:39:38,700
 so more or less from the beginning,

1085
0:39:38,720 --> 0:39:40,340
 they knew this was going to be over

1086
0:39:40,340 --> 0:39:42,800
 because IBM has already entered the market.

1087
0:39:44,480 --> 0:39:48,540
 In 1985, Mons Pelle bought the company

1088
0:39:48,540 --> 0:39:51,320
 which sold his machines.

1089
0:39:53,160 --> 0:39:58,200
 Bero Christensen died way, way too early in 1989.

1090
0:39:59,500 --> 0:40:02,380
 1988, HHS Electronics just were like,

1091
0:40:02,560 --> 0:40:04,360
 we don't want to do this shit anymore

1092
0:40:04,360 --> 0:40:06,140
 and started making...

1093
0:40:06,140 --> 0:40:08,220
 And hold on, you can't make this shit up.

1094
0:40:08,720 --> 0:40:10,020
 Bike lights.

1095
0:40:12,340 --> 0:40:16,120
 They patented the first ever LED-based bike light

1096
0:40:16,120 --> 0:40:18,140
 and made a huge fuss about it,

1097
0:40:18,180 --> 0:40:19,020
 and when people asked them,

1098
0:40:19,060 --> 0:40:20,040
 oh, but that's the back light,

1099
0:40:20,320 --> 0:40:21,280
 can we have the front light?

1100
0:40:21,580 --> 0:40:24,360
 And they said, no, we don't have white LEDs yet.

1101
0:40:24,440 --> 0:40:25,580
 They are not invented yet.

1102
0:40:26,040 --> 0:40:27,220
 So they sold back lights,

1103
0:40:27,660 --> 0:40:29,420
 but actually they sold the patent

1104
0:40:29,420 --> 0:40:33,440
 to one of Europe's largest producers of bike lights,

1105
0:40:33,820 --> 0:40:35,660
 Basta, I think they call.

1106
0:40:36,040 --> 0:40:38,660
 So it's more or less being...

1107
0:40:38,720 --> 0:40:39,760
 Used today, still.

1108
0:40:40,340 --> 0:40:43,940
 And then they started selling equipment for ships

1109
0:40:43,940 --> 0:40:48,240
 and in 1989, they bought a plane.

1110
0:40:48,540 --> 0:40:50,180
 So somehow they made money.

1111
0:40:51,960 --> 0:40:54,280
 Unicomal, which was the last...

1112
0:40:54,280 --> 0:40:57,300
 Oh, no, ICL bought Reinecentralen.

1113
0:40:57,920 --> 0:40:59,980
 And Unicomal, which was the last company

1114
0:40:59,980 --> 0:41:01,340
 who actually produced Comal,

1115
0:41:01,800 --> 0:41:03,100
 closed down in 1993.

1116
0:41:04,200 --> 0:41:06,760
 2002, Fujitsu acquired ICL.

1117
0:41:07,480 --> 0:41:08,420
 And 2019,

1118
0:41:08,720 --> 0:41:11,780
 the last known production software

1119
0:41:11,780 --> 0:41:15,000
 written in BASIC was taken out of commission.

1120
0:41:15,600 --> 0:41:16,700
 That was the chimney sweeper

1121
0:41:16,700 --> 0:41:18,860
 in a small town in Jutland

1122
0:41:18,860 --> 0:41:22,520
 who made his own software in Comal

1123
0:41:22,520 --> 0:41:24,460
 that would take care of his business,

1124
0:41:24,740 --> 0:41:27,260
 which customers am I to visit now

1125
0:41:27,260 --> 0:41:28,980
 and who am I going to bill and all that.

1126
0:41:29,200 --> 0:41:32,080
 He wrote that himself and used that until 2019.

1127
0:41:32,760 --> 0:41:34,520
 I think that's so awesome.

1128
0:41:35,420 --> 0:41:36,980
 Same year, Mike decided to write a book.

1129
0:41:38,720 --> 0:41:41,060
 Time for questions.

1130
0:41:43,600 --> 0:41:44,760
 Thank you very much

1131
0:41:44,760 --> 0:41:47,440
 for this very interesting history talk.

1132
0:41:47,600 --> 0:41:48,700
 Are there questions?

1133
0:41:57,700 --> 0:41:59,480
 So, hello, hello.

1134
0:42:00,580 --> 0:42:05,040
 So, this Comal language was designed

1135
0:42:05,040 --> 0:42:07,120
 or inspired by Pascal.

1136
0:42:07,500 --> 0:42:08,600
 Why not go with...

1137
0:42:08,600 --> 0:42:10,460
 Just Pascal instead of BASIC?

1138
0:42:10,760 --> 0:42:12,300
 So, the reason why they didn't do that

1139
0:42:12,300 --> 0:42:14,480
 was that Comal...

1140
0:42:14,480 --> 0:42:16,060
 Have you tried working on a Commodore 64?

1141
0:42:17,560 --> 0:42:18,000
 Okay.

1142
0:42:18,260 --> 0:42:19,340
 When you have a Commodore 64

1143
0:42:19,340 --> 0:42:20,640
 and nothing else,

1144
0:42:20,680 --> 0:42:21,440
 you just turn it on

1145
0:42:21,440 --> 0:42:22,420
 and you're in BASIC.

1146
0:42:22,580 --> 0:42:22,820
 Bam.

1147
0:42:23,360 --> 0:42:24,480
 You write 10

1148
0:42:24,480 --> 0:42:25,960
 and you write space

1149
0:42:25,960 --> 0:42:27,220
 and you write print hello world.

1150
0:42:27,760 --> 0:42:29,400
 Press enter and type run.

1151
0:42:29,760 --> 0:42:30,920
 Now you're a software developer.

1152
0:42:31,900 --> 0:42:32,380
 More or less.

1153
0:42:32,960 --> 0:42:35,780
 That is super easy to teach to students.

1154
0:42:36,440 --> 0:42:37,580
 Let's try that in Pascal.

1155
0:42:37,980 --> 0:42:38,220
 Okay.

1156
0:42:38,220 --> 0:42:40,380
 Now you need to start the computer

1157
0:42:40,380 --> 0:42:41,260
 and insert a Floppy.

1158
0:42:41,540 --> 0:42:42,180
 Enter that Floppy.

1159
0:42:42,320 --> 0:42:44,060
 Start PolyPascal.

1160
0:42:44,600 --> 0:42:45,600
 That's a keyboard combination

1161
0:42:45,600 --> 0:42:47,740
 for going from command mode

1162
0:42:47,740 --> 0:42:49,360
 into text, into insert mode.

1163
0:42:49,680 --> 0:42:51,760
 Now you need to write use CRT.

1164
0:42:52,820 --> 0:42:54,280
 Use something.

1165
0:42:54,400 --> 0:42:55,240
 You need to use the library

1166
0:42:55,240 --> 0:42:56,700
 in order to print out to the screen.

1167
0:42:57,040 --> 0:42:58,620
 Then you have to write begin and end

1168
0:42:58,620 --> 0:43:00,020
 and then write write line

1169
0:43:00,020 --> 0:43:01,340
 and hello world.

1170
0:43:01,460 --> 0:43:02,400
 Now you need to compile it.

1171
0:43:02,620 --> 0:43:05,540
 Now you need to exit your IDE

1172
0:43:05,540 --> 0:43:07,180
 and run that through the command line.

1173
0:43:08,220 --> 0:43:11,100
 Which one of those would you prefer to teach

1174
0:43:11,100 --> 0:43:13,840
 to ground school students?

1175
0:43:15,180 --> 0:43:16,080
 That was the argument.

1176
0:43:17,520 --> 0:43:20,180
 So they merged together,

1177
0:43:20,260 --> 0:43:22,160
 Komal and Pascal,

1178
0:43:22,160 --> 0:43:25,320
 and made an integrated development environment

1179
0:43:25,320 --> 0:43:27,100
 and it got hugely popular.

1180
0:43:27,920 --> 0:43:29,880
 There's probably going to be written books

1181
0:43:29,880 --> 0:43:31,280
 about that in itself,

1182
0:43:31,520 --> 0:43:32,140
 but not by me.

1183
0:43:32,560 --> 0:43:33,700
 I have enough by this book,

1184
0:43:33,920 --> 0:43:35,160
 I hope, I guess, I think.

1185
0:43:36,060 --> 0:43:36,120
 Yeah.

1186
0:43:37,100 --> 0:43:37,300
 So,

1187
0:43:38,220 --> 0:43:40,040
 until more questions come up,

1188
0:43:40,100 --> 0:43:40,460
 I can just,

1189
0:43:40,960 --> 0:43:44,660
 I'm most likely going to publish this book myself.

1190
0:43:45,380 --> 0:43:45,540
 So,

1191
0:43:46,120 --> 0:43:48,460
 why is this not plugged in?

1192
0:43:49,480 --> 0:43:49,920
 No, okay.

1193
0:43:50,440 --> 0:43:51,240
 Apparently not important.

1194
0:43:51,780 --> 0:43:53,960
 I'm most likely going to publish this book myself.

1195
0:43:54,200 --> 0:43:54,300
 So,

1196
0:43:54,940 --> 0:43:56,940
 if any one of you think this is interesting,

1197
0:43:57,220 --> 0:43:58,380
 please go to my website

1198
0:43:58,380 --> 0:44:00,000
 and pre-order.

1199
0:44:00,160 --> 0:44:02,040
 And this is just a pre-order

1200
0:44:02,040 --> 0:44:04,200
 because you're essentially just signing up

1201
0:44:04,200 --> 0:44:05,200
 for a mailing list

1202
0:44:05,200 --> 0:44:06,880
 and once I'm ready to sell the book,

1203
0:44:06,960 --> 0:44:08,000
 I'm going to write out and say,

1204
0:44:08,100 --> 0:44:08,200
 hey,

1205
0:44:08,480 --> 0:44:09,280
 give me money

1206
0:44:09,280 --> 0:44:10,060
 and I'll give you a book.

1207
0:44:10,360 --> 0:44:11,580
 And if you don't want to give me money,

1208
0:44:11,660 --> 0:44:12,580
 I'm not going to give you a book.

1209
0:44:12,800 --> 0:44:14,400
 So, that's how it works.

1210
0:44:15,280 --> 0:44:18,080
 But I hope to raise some money

1211
0:44:18,080 --> 0:44:20,400
 so I can print some really nice books

1212
0:44:20,400 --> 0:44:22,660
 with hardcover and golden letters

1213
0:44:22,660 --> 0:44:24,440
 and make a really, really nice book.

1214
0:44:25,200 --> 0:44:26,440
 I hope, I hope so.

1215
0:44:26,640 --> 0:44:28,280
 It might just be a PDF, I don't know.

1216
0:44:28,640 --> 0:44:29,180
 Let's see.

1217
0:44:30,020 --> 0:44:30,660
 Any more questions?

1218
0:44:38,220 --> 0:44:39,660
 Thank you so much for listening.

1219
0:44:39,760 --> 0:44:40,420
 Oh, that was a question.

1220
0:44:42,580 --> 0:44:43,680
 So, these machines,

1221
0:44:43,800 --> 0:44:45,900
 they actually use Zilog Z80 processors,

1222
0:44:46,600 --> 0:44:48,340
 but did that also mean

1223
0:44:48,340 --> 0:44:49,180
 that they were compatible

1224
0:44:49,180 --> 0:44:50,820
 with like abundance of software

1225
0:44:50,820 --> 0:44:51,680
 from like,

1226
0:44:51,740 --> 0:44:53,460
 from Sinclair and stuff

1227
0:44:53,460 --> 0:44:55,200
 because there are lots of software back then

1228
0:44:55,200 --> 0:44:56,040
 for bookkeeping

1229
0:44:56,040 --> 0:44:57,620
 and it was really compelling

1230
0:44:57,620 --> 0:44:59,780
 for people to actually buy one of those.

1231
0:45:00,540 --> 0:45:02,120
 But did it ever got a chance

1232
0:45:02,120 --> 0:45:03,440
 to run on these machines?

1233
0:45:04,400 --> 0:45:05,660
 Can you repeat the last sentence?

1234
0:45:06,640 --> 0:45:08,200
 Is it possible to run like,

1235
0:45:08,220 --> 0:45:09,800
 like Z80 software

1236
0:45:09,800 --> 0:45:11,940
 for the Sinclair on these machines?

1237
0:45:12,340 --> 0:45:14,500
 So, yeah, it runs CPM.

1238
0:45:14,680 --> 0:45:16,440
 So, every piece of CPM software

1239
0:45:16,440 --> 0:45:18,240
 that's not dependent on special hardware

1240
0:45:18,240 --> 0:45:18,800
 will work.

1241
0:45:19,340 --> 0:45:20,300
 So, every, more or less,

1242
0:45:20,400 --> 0:45:23,340
 every text-based piece of CPM software,

1243
0:45:23,760 --> 0:45:25,420
 we had, we went to Berlin

1244
0:45:25,420 --> 0:45:26,680
 to the Winter Festival,

1245
0:45:26,900 --> 0:45:29,080
 Winter Community Festival Berlin in 2019

1246
0:45:29,080 --> 0:45:31,160
 and displayed one of the machines

1247
0:45:31,160 --> 0:45:31,900
 running Sork.

1248
0:45:32,420 --> 0:45:34,740
 Sork is a famous text adventure game

1249
0:45:34,740 --> 0:45:37,620
 which was classical CPM game

1250
0:45:37,620 --> 0:45:38,200
 and that was,

1251
0:45:38,200 --> 0:45:39,020
 that runs on the machines.

1252
0:45:39,660 --> 0:45:40,080
 So, yes.

1253
0:45:41,380 --> 0:45:42,340
 Which was, of course,

1254
0:45:42,460 --> 0:45:44,300
 a really important point

1255
0:45:44,300 --> 0:45:45,840
 because you could tell the schools

1256
0:45:45,840 --> 0:45:46,620
 and you could just go

1257
0:45:46,620 --> 0:45:48,540
 and buy almost any kind of software

1258
0:45:48,540 --> 0:45:50,380
 except PC software

1259
0:45:50,380 --> 0:45:51,220
 and that would run on it.

1260
0:45:51,820 --> 0:45:52,780
 Which was, of course,

1261
0:45:52,840 --> 0:45:54,000
 why it died later

1262
0:45:54,000 --> 0:45:56,100
 because everything turned PC

1263
0:45:56,100 --> 0:45:57,140
 during the 90s.

1264
0:46:00,400 --> 0:46:02,340
 Well, maybe a short question from me.

1265
0:46:02,600 --> 0:46:03,780
 On which hardware

1266
0:46:03,780 --> 0:46:06,960
 was this last Komal software running?

1267
0:46:08,200 --> 0:46:10,500
 On my laptop,

1268
0:46:11,500 --> 0:46:12,100
 it's still running.

1269
0:46:12,880 --> 0:46:13,720
 But, yeah, sure,

1270
0:46:14,360 --> 0:46:16,300
 the software for TeamSweeper

1271
0:46:16,300 --> 0:46:17,040
 you were talking about, right?

1272
0:46:17,420 --> 0:46:19,920
 Actually, that was the correct answer

1273
0:46:19,920 --> 0:46:21,640
 because I got that software from him

1274
0:46:21,640 --> 0:46:22,820
 three months ago

1275
0:46:22,820 --> 0:46:24,120
 and it's running on my laptop now.

1276
0:46:24,580 --> 0:46:27,660
 But he built it on this,

1277
0:46:29,320 --> 0:46:30,580
 actually, this machine,

1278
0:46:31,180 --> 0:46:33,500
 the very first machine I showed you

1279
0:46:33,500 --> 0:46:35,760
 belonged to one of his friends.

1280
0:46:35,760 --> 0:46:37,960
 Come on, you can do it.

1281
0:46:38,200 --> 0:46:41,800
 So, maybe I didn't tell you that,

1282
0:46:41,900 --> 0:46:43,380
 but this was a machine

1283
0:46:43,380 --> 0:46:44,880
 where you would buy it

1284
0:46:44,880 --> 0:46:48,720
 as a kit.

1285
0:46:49,420 --> 0:46:51,180
 So, the cabinet and the keyboard,

1286
0:46:51,320 --> 0:46:52,480
 everything was something

1287
0:46:52,480 --> 0:46:53,580
 the individual builder

1288
0:46:53,580 --> 0:46:54,380
 chose by himself.

1289
0:46:55,460 --> 0:46:57,180
 But this was a machine like that

1290
0:46:57,180 --> 0:46:59,500
 ran the TeamSweeper software.

1291
0:47:00,220 --> 0:47:01,660
 And then the TeamSweeper

1292
0:47:01,660 --> 0:47:04,940
 upgraded to a machine like

1293
0:47:04,940 --> 0:47:06,680
 that one?

1294
0:47:06,680 --> 0:47:06,940
 No.

1295
0:47:08,200 --> 0:47:10,620
 Come on, that one.

1296
0:47:11,040 --> 0:47:11,980
 And had that for some years.

1297
0:47:12,520 --> 0:47:13,700
 And then, actually,

1298
0:47:14,340 --> 0:47:15,420
 the friend of the TeamSweeper,

1299
0:47:15,840 --> 0:47:17,100
 the priest from the same town,

1300
0:47:17,580 --> 0:47:19,920
 started writing software for ICL.

1301
0:47:20,660 --> 0:47:24,860
 So, that will be part of the book as well.

1302
0:47:25,600 --> 0:47:27,260
 And then he got the larger one

1303
0:47:27,260 --> 0:47:29,960
 and then during, I think it was 87,

1304
0:47:30,120 --> 0:47:32,300
 he said he bought a 386 PC

1305
0:47:32,300 --> 0:47:34,540
 and split it to Unicomal

1306
0:47:34,540 --> 0:47:36,340
 and kept running his software there.

1307
0:47:37,020 --> 0:47:38,180
 And then just upgraded it.

1308
0:47:38,200 --> 0:47:38,780
 And then he upgraded the computer

1309
0:47:38,780 --> 0:47:39,940
 all the way until he had

1310
0:47:39,940 --> 0:47:41,360
 something like a Core i,

1311
0:47:41,480 --> 0:47:44,060
 something which is insanely huge

1312
0:47:44,060 --> 0:47:45,120
 for a piece of software

1313
0:47:45,120 --> 0:47:46,440
 that could be run on an 8-bit machine

1314
0:47:46,440 --> 0:47:48,060
 with 64 kilobytes of memory.

1315
0:47:48,400 --> 0:47:49,420
 I like the irony of that.

1316
0:47:49,860 --> 0:47:51,920
 And the reason why he stopped using it

1317
0:47:51,920 --> 0:47:53,600
 was he retired

1318
0:47:53,600 --> 0:47:56,020
 and he couldn't get any more printers

1319
0:47:56,020 --> 0:47:57,220
 that would work with a printer port.

1320
0:47:58,280 --> 0:47:59,740
 So, they went USB.

1321
0:48:00,280 --> 0:48:01,040
 So, yeah.

1322
0:48:05,160 --> 0:48:05,600
 Okay.

1323
0:48:06,080 --> 0:48:07,120
 Any further questions?

1324
0:48:07,120 --> 0:48:07,560
 Otherwise,

1325
0:48:08,200 --> 0:48:10,660
 let's thank the speaker again.

1326
0:48:11,580 --> 0:48:12,260
 And...

1327
0:48:12,260 --> 0:48:19,400
 Thank you for listening.

1328
0:48:20,100 --> 0:48:21,120
 Pre-order my book.

1329
0:48:21,520 --> 0:48:23,120
 With that, we finished our lectures

1330
0:48:23,660 --> 0:48:24,980
 in the tent today.
