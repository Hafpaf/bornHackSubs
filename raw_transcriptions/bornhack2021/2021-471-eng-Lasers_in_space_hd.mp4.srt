0:00:00,000 --> 0:00:10,940
 Yes, and I would like to welcome you all to our next talk,

2
0:00:11,260 --> 0:00:14,500
 which is Lasers in Space by Henrik Ehler.

3
0:00:15,100 --> 0:00:15,920
 Here you go, Henrik.

4
0:00:26,720 --> 0:00:28,400
 Yeah? Okay.

5
0:00:30,000 --> 0:00:31,220
 Not that used to microphones.

6
0:00:32,280 --> 0:00:34,380
 Yeah. Thanks for the invitation.

7
0:00:36,160 --> 0:00:38,820
 I haven't been here before, and it's...

8
0:00:38,820 --> 0:00:40,320
 Well, I've been here a few hours now.

9
0:00:40,400 --> 0:00:41,640
 It is quite a big experience.

10
0:00:42,600 --> 0:00:44,580
 It really seems like an amazing place.

11
0:00:45,580 --> 0:00:47,520
 I even tried this...

12
0:00:47,520 --> 0:00:49,720
 I can't describe it, but...

13
0:00:49,720 --> 0:00:52,300
 Yeah. Maybe you'll get used to it. I don't know.

14
0:00:53,300 --> 0:00:57,720
 So, yeah, I was invited to talk about

15
0:00:57,720 --> 0:00:59,980
 one of my side projects,

16
0:01:00,000 --> 0:01:03,680
 and I work a little bit here and there

17
0:01:03,680 --> 0:01:07,560
 on all sorts of different things.

18
0:01:08,560 --> 0:01:13,040
 But one of my projects is about sending stuff into space on purpose.

19
0:01:15,580 --> 0:01:20,060
 And, yeah, I have a small creation to the title

20
0:01:20,060 --> 0:01:24,100
 because it's more like it's not lasers in general,

21
0:01:24,200 --> 0:01:25,080
 but my laser.

22
0:01:26,200 --> 0:01:27,360
 Well, our laser.

23
0:01:27,360 --> 0:01:28,160
 So...

24
0:01:28,160 --> 0:01:29,360
 Um...

25
0:01:30,000 --> 0:01:33,260
 I'm doing the project together with a company in Aalborg.

26
0:01:33,520 --> 0:01:35,960
 It's not GOM Space, but something called Space Inventor.

27
0:01:38,220 --> 0:01:41,600
 It was founded by one of the founders of GOM Space.

28
0:01:42,420 --> 0:01:45,000
 And we're doing it together with ESA and...

29
0:01:47,740 --> 0:01:52,360
 It's not called HÃ¸jteknologi Fund.

30
0:01:52,440 --> 0:01:55,000
 It's called the Innovation Fund.

31
0:01:57,440 --> 0:01:57,920
 So...

32
0:01:57,920 --> 0:01:58,800
 I will...

33
0:01:58,800 --> 0:01:59,980
 And also, if you have any questions,

34
0:02:00,000 --> 0:02:02,940
 during the presentation, just let me know.

35
0:02:03,160 --> 0:02:05,480
 And we can also take them afterwards.

36
0:02:07,780 --> 0:02:09,160
 Just a small disclaimer.

37
0:02:09,580 --> 0:02:14,200
 We are involved in a proposal for a new project

38
0:02:14,200 --> 0:02:19,080
 where parts of this system will be integrated into.

39
0:02:20,100 --> 0:02:22,420
 And the proposal has been...

40
0:02:22,420 --> 0:02:24,380
 The deadline for the proposal has been postponed,

41
0:02:25,000 --> 0:02:27,000
 meaning that I have had last night

42
0:02:27,000 --> 0:02:28,860
 to cut out quite a bit of my presentation

43
0:02:28,860 --> 0:02:29,580
 because there's just some things that I have to do.

44
0:02:29,580 --> 0:02:31,180
 Just some things I can't discuss yet.

45
0:02:31,820 --> 0:02:34,440
 Not because it's, like, government secrets,

46
0:02:34,940 --> 0:02:38,340
 but it's in terms of IP rights.

47
0:02:39,500 --> 0:02:41,340
 We have competition...

48
0:02:41,340 --> 0:02:44,620
 There's competition for dark...

49
0:02:44,620 --> 0:02:46,280
 We have competitors and...

50
0:02:46,280 --> 0:02:49,220
 Well, so we're keeping our cards a little bit closed

51
0:02:49,220 --> 0:02:50,100
 on some of the things.

52
0:02:52,560 --> 0:02:54,520
 But still, I mean, I have 40 slides.

53
0:02:54,960 --> 0:02:56,600
 So it'll be fun.

54
0:02:57,240 --> 0:02:57,940
 I hope.

55
0:02:59,580 --> 0:03:01,980
 So, yeah, we need...

56
0:03:01,980 --> 0:03:05,680
 I just want to go a little bit back in time

57
0:03:05,680 --> 0:03:10,460
 just to let you know where I'm coming from

58
0:03:10,460 --> 0:03:11,800
 and where the project is coming from.

59
0:03:12,440 --> 0:03:14,580
 So we need to go back to the...

60
0:03:15,540 --> 0:03:17,220
 Yeah, let's make some suspense.

61
0:03:17,560 --> 0:03:19,200
 The year that brought us the DAP,

62
0:03:20,700 --> 0:03:22,100
 BB-8,

63
0:03:23,760 --> 0:03:24,680
 burning hoverboards,

64
0:03:25,000 --> 0:03:27,600
 and, of course, Katy Perry's left shark.

65
0:03:28,700 --> 0:03:29,560
 Of course, I'm talking about...

66
0:03:29,580 --> 0:03:30,800
 I'm talking about 2015.

67
0:03:31,320 --> 0:03:32,320
 It's not that long ago.

68
0:03:32,820 --> 0:03:35,680
 But it was a time where I was a little bit

69
0:03:35,680 --> 0:03:37,760
 in between projects and jobs.

70
0:03:38,840 --> 0:03:41,880
 And a aforementioned friend of mine

71
0:03:41,880 --> 0:03:44,000
 who founded Space Inventors,

72
0:03:44,160 --> 0:03:47,580
 he approached me because he wanted to...

73
0:03:51,740 --> 0:03:54,960
 Well, probably a word at that time was disruption,

74
0:03:55,180 --> 0:03:58,580
 but he wanted to disrupt the small satellite industry.

75
0:03:59,580 --> 0:04:06,200
 He also knew that I was involved in DTU-SAT-2.

76
0:04:06,600 --> 0:04:07,580
 That was like...

77
0:04:07,580 --> 0:04:09,740
 At that time, it was 10 years ago,

78
0:04:09,860 --> 0:04:12,460
 so, yeah, I'm getting old, I guess.

79
0:04:13,900 --> 0:04:16,540
 And I also apologize that I don't have

80
0:04:16,540 --> 0:04:20,420
 higher-resolution pictures than this,

81
0:04:20,560 --> 0:04:23,340
 but the incident was just, I don't know,

82
0:04:23,540 --> 0:04:24,860
 720p at that time,

83
0:04:24,960 --> 0:04:26,780
 so it's the best I got.

84
0:04:27,980 --> 0:04:28,780
 That project was...

85
0:04:29,580 --> 0:04:32,040
 It was about tracking birds.

86
0:04:33,900 --> 0:04:36,940
 At my time on DTU, it never launched.

87
0:04:37,140 --> 0:04:39,560
 I think it only launched like five years ago.

88
0:04:40,120 --> 0:04:40,680
 But nevertheless,

89
0:04:42,680 --> 0:04:43,580
 there was...

90
0:04:43,580 --> 0:04:46,360
 It was just a few courses I had at DTU,

91
0:04:46,460 --> 0:04:47,580
 but it was my...

92
0:04:48,620 --> 0:04:51,060
 It was the starting point for this project

93
0:04:51,060 --> 0:04:53,720
 because I knew a little bit about space technology.

94
0:04:53,720 --> 0:04:56,440
 Not much, but I've touched it.

95
0:04:59,580 --> 0:05:03,540
 And as I said, we wanted to take a different approach

96
0:05:03,540 --> 0:05:06,480
 to producing and designing microsatellites.

97
0:05:08,580 --> 0:05:09,480
 It's been...

98
0:05:11,100 --> 0:05:16,020
 There are like two ways into this industry.

99
0:05:16,260 --> 0:05:20,340
 There are the big competitors that make huge satellites,

100
0:05:21,560 --> 0:05:23,720
 like governments and private entities,

101
0:05:24,220 --> 0:05:26,280
 and then there are the universities.

102
0:05:26,920 --> 0:05:28,900
 And it's two very different approaches.

103
0:05:28,900 --> 0:05:38,540
 So our philosophy was to take the way the big companies did it

104
0:05:38,540 --> 0:05:41,300
 and try to miniaturize some of these things.

105
0:05:44,860 --> 0:05:45,900
 And this was 2015.

106
0:05:46,880 --> 0:05:47,980
 About seven months later,

107
0:05:48,100 --> 0:05:52,560
 we attended a conference in Malta called the 4S Symposium.

108
0:05:52,560 --> 0:05:53,560
 It's...

109
0:05:53,560 --> 0:05:54,560
 It's...

110
0:05:54,560 --> 0:05:57,560
 It's...

111
0:05:58,900 --> 0:06:04,780
 It's a small conference for companies that produce

112
0:06:04,780 --> 0:06:09,900
 both complete satellites but also subsystems for these microsatellites.

113
0:06:09,900 --> 0:06:15,600
 So you won't see if the big companies,

114
0:06:15,780 --> 0:06:20,900
 but all sorts of startups and independent young companies

115
0:06:20,900 --> 0:06:22,900
 attend these symposiums.

116
0:06:23,720 --> 0:06:26,800
 Of course, there's also a lot of talks like here,

117
0:06:27,060 --> 0:06:27,900
 but also...

118
0:06:27,900 --> 0:06:28,780
 But...

119
0:06:28,780 --> 0:06:32,900
 But in this case, we had our booth where we presented our products.

120
0:06:35,700 --> 0:06:36,700
 Just take a sip here.

121
0:06:42,020 --> 0:06:43,020
 Yeah, I'm...

122
0:06:43,300 --> 0:06:44,300
 Okay.

123
0:06:45,700 --> 0:06:46,700
 So...

124
0:06:48,100 --> 0:06:51,620
 One of the things we did was to pack all our subsystems

125
0:06:51,620 --> 0:06:57,900
 into individual smaller pages or encasings, which is, again,

126
0:06:57,900 --> 0:06:58,660
 is the way to...

127
0:06:58,660 --> 0:06:59,940
 The big boys do it.

128
0:06:59,940 --> 0:07:04,420
 And we got...

129
0:07:04,420 --> 0:07:07,140
 Thanks.

130
0:07:07,580 --> 0:07:09,280
 It's not that bad, actually.

131
0:07:09,520 --> 0:07:10,140
 Just...

132
0:07:10,140 --> 0:07:11,980
 Just new.

133
0:07:11,980 --> 0:07:12,140
 Yeah.

134
0:07:12,140 --> 0:07:19,840
 So, anyway.

135
0:07:22,160 --> 0:07:28,540
 Yeah, we took this approach to design things to be very...

136
0:07:28,540 --> 0:07:33,940
 very robust and small, independent modules that could be stacked together.

137
0:07:33,940 --> 0:07:35,880
 This meant that we could...

138
0:07:35,880 --> 0:07:41,820
 From our Lego bricks, we could build a whole satellites in a matter of days

139
0:07:41,820 --> 0:07:45,840
 from off-the-shelf items we've made or not off-the-shelf,

140
0:07:45,840 --> 0:07:52,200
 but independent systems we've made compared to a normal microsatellite

141
0:07:52,200 --> 0:07:55,740
 that would take like months just to put together.

142
0:07:55,740 --> 0:07:56,660
 So yeah.

143
0:07:56,660 --> 0:07:57,180
 We got a lot of stuff in the end, but...

144
0:07:57,180 --> 0:07:57,420
 Okay.

145
0:07:57,420 --> 0:07:57,580
 Okay.

146
0:07:57,580 --> 0:07:57,700
 So, yeah, we got a lot of stuff in the end, but...

147
0:07:57,700 --> 0:07:57,860
 So, yeah, we got a lot of stuff in the end, but...

148
0:07:57,860 --> 0:07:57,940
 So, yeah, we got a lot of stuff in the end, but...

149
0:07:57,940 --> 0:08:01,360
 We got a lot of attention also from Acer.

150
0:08:03,860 --> 0:08:10,600
 One of the products we presented was our LaserLink, or Laser Downlink Terminal, as we call it.

151
0:08:12,380 --> 0:08:22,160
 This was another almost coincidence, because besides my involvement with the DTU set,

152
0:08:22,300 --> 0:08:26,800
 I spent quite a lot of time at the photonics department at DTU.

153
0:08:26,800 --> 0:08:29,980
 So I also knew a little bit about lasers.

154
0:08:31,560 --> 0:08:35,300
 And just in a second, I will come to why we want lasers in space.

155
0:08:35,720 --> 0:08:44,700
 But this little thing got a lot of attention, and it was just a prototype.

156
0:08:46,140 --> 0:08:49,440
 We weren't really sure if it would work or how it would work.

157
0:08:50,460 --> 0:08:55,020
 We also met people that have been trying to do this for plus 10 years,

158
0:08:55,020 --> 0:08:56,360
 and they were like, how did you make this?

159
0:08:56,800 --> 0:08:57,620
 It's so small.

160
0:08:57,680 --> 0:09:02,240
 And I was like, I didn't know what to say, because it's just a prototype.

161
0:09:03,560 --> 0:09:09,420
 So now let's get into the reason for the product.

162
0:09:11,060 --> 0:09:17,880
 So why do we, yeah, that was our backstory, but why would we want to put lasers into space?

163
0:09:21,240 --> 0:09:24,420
 Well, it can solve quite a big problem.

164
0:09:24,920 --> 0:09:25,880
 A problem that is...

165
0:09:26,800 --> 0:09:33,180
 It's relevant both for big and small satellites, but especially for small satellites.

166
0:09:33,180 --> 0:09:36,860
 And it's a matter of communication.

167
0:09:37,940 --> 0:09:40,360
 I guess you probably guessed that by now.

168
0:09:42,320 --> 0:09:49,420
 But if we take a look at the traditional approach to data downlink from satellites,

169
0:09:50,120 --> 0:09:52,100
 again, this is not to scale.

170
0:09:54,060 --> 0:09:56,740
 The satellite is, in fact, quite a bit smaller.

171
0:09:56,800 --> 0:09:57,100
 I don't know if you can see it on this.

172
0:09:58,740 --> 0:09:59,260
 Yeah, sorry.

173
0:09:59,380 --> 0:10:00,920
 And there's no banana, but, you know.

174
0:10:03,080 --> 0:10:06,040
 But again, this is just a representation.

175
0:10:06,040 --> 0:10:10,020
 So this satellite is in what's called low Earth orbit,

176
0:10:10,400 --> 0:10:15,660
 which is about anywhere from 400 to 800 kilometers above sea level.

177
0:10:17,760 --> 0:10:26,100
 The speed is between 7.5 to 9 kilometers per second, depending on the orbit.

178
0:10:26,800 --> 0:10:34,240
 And that means the round time is roughly 100 minutes for rotation of the Earth.

179
0:10:36,740 --> 0:10:42,260
 So this means that when you want to communicate with your satellite,

180
0:10:43,220 --> 0:10:46,060
 this is completely different to geostationary satellites.

181
0:10:46,180 --> 0:10:47,840
 Of course, they have a fixed position.

182
0:10:47,960 --> 0:10:49,020
 That's a whole different story.

183
0:10:49,020 --> 0:10:55,000
 But these low Earth orbit satellites, you only have a few minutes, maybe two, three times a day,

184
0:10:55,060 --> 0:10:56,020
 where you can talk with...

185
0:10:56,800 --> 0:10:59,740
 talk with your product or your project.

186
0:11:02,540 --> 0:11:08,600
 And due to budget and frequency allocations,

187
0:11:09,460 --> 0:11:15,820
 most small satellites, they need to use the ISM bands.

188
0:11:16,620 --> 0:11:20,840
 So, yeah, anywhere from 400 megahertz to a few gigahertz.

189
0:11:21,740 --> 0:11:23,840
 And the reason for this is that they...

190
0:11:25,340 --> 0:11:25,840
 even though...

191
0:11:25,840 --> 0:11:25,860
 even though...

192
0:11:25,860 --> 0:11:26,140
 even though...

193
0:11:26,140 --> 0:11:26,200
 even though...

194
0:11:26,200 --> 0:11:26,740
 even though...

195
0:11:26,740 --> 0:11:26,780
 even though...

196
0:11:26,780 --> 0:11:28,700
 you try to make a very directional antenna,

197
0:11:29,020 --> 0:11:33,920
 you'll usually cover a circle about 3,000 kilometers,

198
0:11:34,580 --> 0:11:36,360
 even from this low altitude.

199
0:11:37,280 --> 0:11:39,340
 It means that when you try to send data,

200
0:11:39,340 --> 0:11:45,100
 I mean, you take up the frequency space for whole continents.

201
0:11:47,320 --> 0:11:51,560
 And this means that you can send with a very high power,

202
0:11:52,040 --> 0:11:55,960
 which again means that you can't really send very much data.

203
0:11:56,780 --> 0:12:01,640
 you can get a frequency allocation saying that you can use a specific frequency

204
0:12:01,640 --> 0:12:05,600
 and say you have a lot higher power, but it's very, very expensive

205
0:12:05,600 --> 0:12:09,840
 because it covers so many countries or whole continents.

206
0:12:10,720 --> 0:12:16,460
 So it means that the effective data rate of these small satellites

207
0:12:16,460 --> 0:12:20,120
 are in the kilobits range,

208
0:12:21,300 --> 0:12:24,680
 which is fine for housekeeping data

209
0:12:24,680 --> 0:12:30,560
 and just to get a beacon from your satellite.

210
0:12:31,620 --> 0:12:35,160
 But one of the things that people really want to do is to take pictures.

211
0:12:36,920 --> 0:12:42,060
 And it's not that difficult to put a nice camera on a satellite,

212
0:12:42,200 --> 0:12:44,160
 even the small ones, the small satellites.

213
0:12:44,820 --> 0:12:48,840
 But with this data rate, it takes days just to get a single image.

214
0:12:51,380 --> 0:12:54,500
 And if you have hyperspectral cameras

215
0:12:54,500 --> 0:12:54,660
 or if you have hyperspectral cameras,

216
0:12:54,680 --> 0:12:58,680
 or other scientific equipment that produce even more data,

217
0:12:59,060 --> 0:13:00,780
 you have a bottleneck there.

218
0:13:01,460 --> 0:13:05,900
 So that's where our laser comes into play.

219
0:13:07,300 --> 0:13:13,400
 First of all, the affected circle is, depending on the altitude,

220
0:13:13,920 --> 0:13:18,040
 it's about 100 meters compared to 3,000 kilometers.

221
0:13:18,040 --> 0:13:24,620
 So we only hit a very small area of the Earth,

222
0:13:24,680 --> 0:13:29,640
 and just due to the nature of optical transmission,

223
0:13:29,640 --> 0:13:36,140
 I mean, it's not picked up by all sorts of things

224
0:13:36,140 --> 0:13:37,960
 and garage door openers.

225
0:13:41,540 --> 0:13:47,040
 And it means that we can achieve speeds,

226
0:13:47,300 --> 0:13:48,640
 even with these small systems,

227
0:13:50,460 --> 0:13:52,320
 easily one gigabit per second.

228
0:13:53,380 --> 0:13:54,660
 But in theory, with our current system,

229
0:13:54,660 --> 0:13:56,140
 10 gigabits per second.

230
0:13:57,600 --> 0:14:03,200
 That's including overhead for error creations and so on.

231
0:14:10,620 --> 0:14:15,600
 So that's sort of the back story

232
0:14:15,600 --> 0:14:17,740
 and why the product is relevant.

233
0:14:17,740 --> 0:14:24,640
 I need to also say that this is not a,

234
0:14:24,640 --> 0:14:26,180
 an original idea.

235
0:14:28,220 --> 0:14:31,500
 NASA has been working on this for quite some time.

236
0:14:31,620 --> 0:14:33,100
 This is just a render,

237
0:14:33,260 --> 0:14:36,160
 but it's from a project called OPLES,

238
0:14:36,500 --> 0:14:39,220
 which was tested on the ISS.

239
0:14:42,180 --> 0:14:46,300
 So, yeah, putting lasers into space is not new,

240
0:14:47,000 --> 0:14:50,780
 but doing it at that small scale,

241
0:14:51,380 --> 0:14:52,380
 that's the,

242
0:14:52,380 --> 0:14:54,620
 that's also the hard part,

243
0:14:54,760 --> 0:14:56,680
 but that's our core business.

244
0:14:58,460 --> 0:15:00,800
 You could never fit this to a CubeSat.

245
0:15:01,500 --> 0:15:01,800
 It's,

246
0:15:04,100 --> 0:15:05,360
 I can't remember the exact size,

247
0:15:05,440 --> 0:15:07,520
 but a few meters on each direction,

248
0:15:07,740 --> 0:15:08,380
 as far as I remember.

249
0:15:09,700 --> 0:15:09,800
 So,

250
0:15:10,720 --> 0:15:14,280
 for those of you who are not,

251
0:15:14,960 --> 0:15:15,780
 don't know this,

252
0:15:15,780 --> 0:15:18,560
 this is a 1U CubeSat.

253
0:15:20,060 --> 0:15:24,420
 It's also called a U-class,

254
0:15:24,420 --> 0:15:26,720
 a U-class spacecraft.

255
0:15:26,720 --> 0:15:31,280
 It's, it was developed for use with,

256
0:15:31,280 --> 0:15:34,000
 especially universities to get,

257
0:15:34,000 --> 0:15:36,400
 just get a chance to send something into space

258
0:15:36,400 --> 0:15:39,180
 without being part of a huge million,

259
0:15:39,180 --> 0:15:41,800
 multi-billion project.

260
0:15:44,140 --> 0:15:47,200
 So this one liter cube is the,

261
0:15:48,800 --> 0:15:51,260
 it's like the minimal dimensions.

262
0:15:52,300 --> 0:15:53,120
 I, so,

263
0:15:53,120 --> 0:15:54,700
 I brought one.

264
0:15:54,700 --> 0:15:56,900
 This is a 2U satellite.

265
0:15:57,260 --> 0:15:58,780
 There's nothing in it.

266
0:15:58,780 --> 0:16:01,020
 It's just the mechanics.

267
0:16:01,940 --> 0:16:03,880
 But in principle,

268
0:16:03,880 --> 0:16:06,800
 you can build these up to 24 units,

269
0:16:06,800 --> 0:16:07,420
 not in length,

270
0:16:07,420 --> 0:16:10,200
 but you can go in all three dimensions.

271
0:16:10,200 --> 0:16:12,960
 So two by two by two or whatever you want.

272
0:16:14,100 --> 0:16:15,580
 But it's a nice form factor.

273
0:16:15,580 --> 0:16:19,900
 And it also means that many of the launch providers,

274
0:16:19,900 --> 0:16:23,000
 they, these are not sent up.

275
0:16:23,000 --> 0:16:25,440
 Usually just as the,

276
0:16:25,440 --> 0:16:26,760
 as the primary payload,

277
0:16:26,760 --> 0:16:29,320
 but they piggyback on different,

278
0:16:29,320 --> 0:16:30,160
 on bigger missions.

279
0:16:30,160 --> 0:16:31,780
 So when,

280
0:16:31,780 --> 0:16:35,240
 when a company paid for launch of a communication satellite,

281
0:16:35,240 --> 0:16:36,500
 there's also,

282
0:16:36,500 --> 0:16:39,100
 this gets stowed away in that glove box,

283
0:16:39,100 --> 0:16:39,940
 so to speak.

284
0:16:41,000 --> 0:16:41,840
 More precisely,

285
0:16:41,840 --> 0:16:43,340
 it's in a small,

286
0:16:44,580 --> 0:16:45,960
 in a small tube,

287
0:16:45,960 --> 0:16:49,240
 and it'll get ejected into,

288
0:16:50,920 --> 0:16:52,700
 into space after the satellite,

289
0:16:52,700 --> 0:16:54,680
 after the satellite has been released from the,

290
0:16:54,680 --> 0:16:55,880
 from the launch vehicle.

291
0:16:57,140 --> 0:17:00,320
 Another great thing about this philosophy

292
0:17:00,320 --> 0:17:03,220
 is to use a lot of what's called off-the-shelf,

293
0:17:04,060 --> 0:17:06,880
 no, commercial off-the-shelf equipment,

294
0:17:06,880 --> 0:17:08,140
 means that we,

295
0:17:08,140 --> 0:17:10,000
 you don't have to develop everything yourself.

296
0:17:10,000 --> 0:17:10,920
 You can use,

297
0:17:13,220 --> 0:17:15,020
 is my computer making a noise?

298
0:17:17,020 --> 0:17:18,140
 Oh, never mind.

299
0:17:18,140 --> 0:17:21,100
 I just didn't know what was going on.

300
0:17:21,100 --> 0:17:22,180
 But you can use,

301
0:17:22,700 --> 0:17:26,100
 like off-the-shelf camera modules and so on,

302
0:17:26,100 --> 0:17:26,940
 because it's not,

303
0:17:26,940 --> 0:17:31,940
 it's not a critical thing if it doesn't work,

304
0:17:32,600 --> 0:17:35,160
 but at least you learn something.

305
0:17:35,160 --> 0:17:37,740
 So the,

306
0:17:37,740 --> 0:17:40,200
 also the technology level,

307
0:17:40,200 --> 0:17:43,500
 witness level requirements for sending a CubeSat

308
0:17:43,500 --> 0:17:47,100
 into space is a lot less than for,

309
0:17:47,100 --> 0:17:48,320
 for real spacecraft.

310
0:17:49,540 --> 0:17:51,460
 Anyway, what did I,

311
0:17:51,460 --> 0:17:52,300
 so as,

312
0:17:52,700 --> 0:17:56,460
 as you can see in the picture of January of this year,

313
0:17:56,460 --> 0:18:00,140
 about 1,300 CubeSats are in orbit,

314
0:18:00,140 --> 0:18:01,400
 or they have been launched.

315
0:18:02,240 --> 0:18:06,340
 1,200 successfully,

316
0:18:06,340 --> 0:18:10,620
 and 90 has been destroyed in launch failures,

317
0:18:10,620 --> 0:18:14,840
 or are just not operational,

318
0:18:14,840 --> 0:18:16,400
 or was never operational.

319
0:18:18,500 --> 0:18:21,440
 Since these are built by primarily students,

320
0:18:22,700 --> 0:18:25,200
 so, yeah, mistakes happen.

321
0:18:27,200 --> 0:18:28,960
 Both the first,

322
0:18:28,960 --> 0:18:32,460
 the first few CubeSats from Denmark wasn't functional,

323
0:18:32,460 --> 0:18:34,860
 not for long as I remember.

324
0:18:34,860 --> 0:18:37,700
 And, yeah.

325
0:18:37,700 --> 0:18:39,400
 This is just a,

326
0:18:39,400 --> 0:18:43,280
 this is a render of one new CubeSat made

327
0:18:43,280 --> 0:18:44,480
 with a space inventor.

328
0:18:45,780 --> 0:18:50,360
 The, yeah, the kind of price,

329
0:18:50,360 --> 0:18:52,460
 these are quite inexpensive.

330
0:18:52,700 --> 0:18:58,200
 A guy like this with solar panels and some payload

331
0:18:58,200 --> 0:19:01,240
 will run you just about 200, 300,000 euros.

332
0:19:01,240 --> 0:19:03,400
 So it's, it's affordable.

333
0:19:04,400 --> 0:19:05,240
 So,

334
0:19:07,300 --> 0:19:11,800
 I'll go into a little bit details about the laser project.

335
0:19:13,260 --> 0:19:16,120
 And some of the drawings I'll show you

336
0:19:16,120 --> 0:19:18,500
 are of a little bit older date,

337
0:19:18,500 --> 0:19:20,540
 because as I said, we,

338
0:19:20,540 --> 0:19:21,940
 we ran into some issues.

339
0:19:21,940 --> 0:19:22,700
 So, yeah.

340
0:19:22,700 --> 0:19:24,760
 Last night, we got in what we can show them,

341
0:19:24,760 --> 0:19:25,600
 but we can't.

342
0:19:26,820 --> 0:19:27,660
 So,

343
0:19:29,800 --> 0:19:31,500
 this is way too small to see, right?

344
0:19:32,500 --> 0:19:33,340
 Okay.

345
0:19:33,340 --> 0:19:36,120
 So I have, let's see.

346
0:19:36,120 --> 0:19:37,300
 Yeah.

347
0:19:37,300 --> 0:19:40,300
 This just simplified diagram of the system.

348
0:19:41,740 --> 0:19:45,840
 I just, now it's upside or on the side,

349
0:19:45,840 --> 0:19:48,060
 but at least a little bit bigger.

350
0:19:48,060 --> 0:19:51,060
 Just to show you the main components of the laser terminal.

351
0:19:52,700 --> 0:19:56,160
 We have the OBC, which is onboard computer.

352
0:19:56,160 --> 0:20:05,160
 It communicates with something called a space wire,

353
0:20:05,160 --> 0:20:07,740
 which is a derivative of a fire wire.

354
0:20:07,740 --> 0:20:10,260
 No, it's not a joke.

355
0:20:10,260 --> 0:20:11,560
 It's, it's real.

356
0:20:11,560 --> 0:20:13,640
 It sounds way cooler.

357
0:20:13,640 --> 0:20:16,600
 I mean, fire wire was already a cool name, but you know.

358
0:20:16,600 --> 0:20:20,020
 And then we have the optical subsystem.

359
0:20:20,020 --> 0:20:21,860
 It consists of two parts.

360
0:20:21,860 --> 0:20:25,060
 It consists of a seed laser.

361
0:20:25,060 --> 0:20:30,060
 We're running at 1260, 1064 nanometers.

362
0:20:30,380 --> 0:20:35,300
 And the seed laser is what we modulate with our data signal.

363
0:20:35,300 --> 0:20:38,660
 It goes into a fiber amplifier,

364
0:20:41,140 --> 0:20:44,680
 which amplifies the signal from a few milliwatts

365
0:20:44,680 --> 0:20:47,560
 to about one watt optical output power.

366
0:20:48,880 --> 0:20:51,100
 It's not, I mean, it's not that much.

367
0:20:51,100 --> 0:20:53,880
 You can get laser pointers.

368
0:20:53,880 --> 0:20:55,900
 You shouldn't, but you can.

369
0:20:55,900 --> 0:20:58,820
 They're way more powerful than this.

370
0:20:59,820 --> 0:21:01,600
 But our beam is much nicer.

371
0:21:01,600 --> 0:21:02,640
 I assure you that.

372
0:21:04,380 --> 0:21:08,800
 And then we have some mechanics for fine steering.

373
0:21:08,800 --> 0:21:10,700
 And I'll come back to why we need that.

374
0:21:11,980 --> 0:21:16,820
 One of the big issues with a system like this is,

375
0:21:16,820 --> 0:21:19,820
 remember we only hit 100 meters per second.

376
0:21:21,100 --> 0:21:23,000
 That's the size of the target.

377
0:21:23,000 --> 0:21:24,240
 It's not 100 meters.

378
0:21:24,240 --> 0:21:29,280
 Well, not target, but our beam is just 100 meters

379
0:21:29,280 --> 0:21:32,740
 from four to six hundred kilometers away.

380
0:21:32,740 --> 0:21:39,740
 So it's quite difficult to hit the right, hit the target.

381
0:21:40,640 --> 0:21:45,520
 Small satellites like this one, they, when they're in orbit,

382
0:21:45,520 --> 0:21:49,740
 they are not, they, I mean, they rotate like crazy.

383
0:21:49,740 --> 0:21:49,860
 They are not, this is very hard to see.

384
0:21:49,860 --> 0:21:50,320
 It's not that easy to see.

385
0:21:50,320 --> 0:21:50,460
 It's not that easy to see.

386
0:21:50,460 --> 0:21:50,540
 It's not that easy to see.

387
0:21:50,540 --> 0:21:50,620
 It's not that easy to see.

388
0:21:50,620 --> 0:21:58,660
 they're not stationary and that's why we have something called attitude control system but

389
0:21:58,660 --> 0:22:06,520
 even with with a system like this they are very very unstable I mean we are talking things like

390
0:22:06,520 --> 0:22:15,560
 plus minus a whole degree of movement which is which is fine for everything else but almost

391
0:22:15,560 --> 0:22:23,900
 trying to hit the earth with a laser so it's quite fine and to control system is consist of

392
0:22:23,900 --> 0:22:32,520
 two major components reaction wheels which just imagine a skateboard wheel with a motor and you

393
0:22:32,520 --> 0:22:39,380
 can spin it up and we have this whole thing about a reaction and action and reaction mean then we

394
0:22:39,380 --> 0:22:43,220
 spin something in one direction the whole spacecraft spins in the other direction we

395
0:22:43,220 --> 0:22:44,440
 have four of those so we can

396
0:22:45,560 --> 0:22:53,120
 orient or we can turn in all directions and then we have something called magnet augers and that's

397
0:22:53,120 --> 0:23:00,080
 because when these wheels they hit a certain speed they can't go any faster so at certain intervals

398
0:23:00,080 --> 0:23:09,860
 we need to dump our the energy in the wheels so we lock with these magnetic or with these calls

399
0:23:09,860 --> 0:23:15,240
 we can sort of lock on to the earth make earth's magnetic field

400
0:23:15,560 --> 0:23:22,820
 mean that we by sending um power to the course we can keep the spacecraft stationary right we

401
0:23:22,820 --> 0:23:26,780
 spin down the wheels and when we're done with that we can start spinning up the wheels and

402
0:23:26,780 --> 0:23:32,480
 getting into position again that's also a whole science that's that's also a product for space

403
0:23:32,480 --> 0:23:39,980
 inventor so just let me know if you want to buy one um anyway with this system we can get the

404
0:23:39,980 --> 0:23:45,200
 pointing accuracy of about plus minus one degree which is nowhere near

405
0:23:45,560 --> 0:23:54,320
 good enough for for our laser but we are getting there um but that's just that's not the only

406
0:23:54,320 --> 0:24:04,040
 problem because we the spacecraft sort of knows where it is but not precisely when you launch a

407
0:24:04,040 --> 0:24:13,400
 spacecraft you you'll get your um the orbit parameters back from the launch providers and

408
0:24:13,400 --> 0:24:15,380
 you can kind of predict where where the

409
0:24:15,560 --> 0:24:20,060
 spacecraft will be at a given time and you can relay this data to a spacecraft

410
0:24:20,540 --> 0:24:23,900
 and it will kind of know where to point the laser

411
0:24:25,640 --> 0:24:34,220
 um but again it's not precise enough so we need a beacon from Earth uh which we send into space

412
0:24:34,820 --> 0:24:43,040
 it could look like this but it doesn't um it's just it's just a small five watt laser and it

413
0:24:43,040 --> 0:24:45,540
 goes out of a telescope so it's a quite big beam

414
0:24:45,560 --> 0:24:56,660
 so it's I mean we it's it's kind of boring actually uh but we we we point the the lasers

415
0:24:56,660 --> 0:25:02,240
 to the area in the sky where we expect the satellite to be when we want to communicate with

416
0:25:03,560 --> 0:25:09,680
 um we don't know exactly where it is so on the first orbits will go in some special patterns

417
0:25:09,680 --> 0:25:15,440
 uh actually just circle going upwards just in hopes to to get a log on

418
0:25:15,560 --> 0:25:23,240
 uh other people that have tried this if you need to use multiple uh orbits just to to get the first

419
0:25:23,240 --> 0:25:31,940
 light uh hitting the satellite so we're very not concerned but yeah let's see how it goes

420
0:25:33,140 --> 0:25:40,820
 um and actually we we just to correct myself we don't point at the salary we have some pointer

421
0:25:40,820 --> 0:25:45,520
 hit so because uh a little bit of uh travel time so we point to the other and then we do the same thing

422
0:25:45,560 --> 0:25:50,400
 to where we expect the spacecraft to be when the beam hits it.

423
0:25:52,720 --> 0:25:55,180
 Let's go back to this slide again.

424
0:25:57,040 --> 0:26:02,440
 On the far top right, you can see that's where the beacon laser hits the spacecraft,

425
0:26:03,400 --> 0:26:06,160
 and it goes through some optics,

426
0:26:06,160 --> 0:26:17,260
 and then the beacon laser is focused down just to a commercial machine vision camera.

427
0:26:18,520 --> 0:26:24,700
 We use that to track the dot around on the chip.

428
0:26:31,180 --> 0:26:34,160
 One thing I can tell you, on this image,

429
0:26:35,440 --> 0:26:36,140
 you probably can't see it,

430
0:26:36,380 --> 0:26:40,880
 but the whole right box, at that time we designed this,

431
0:26:40,880 --> 0:26:47,680
 we wanted to move both the receiver and all the optics.

432
0:26:49,040 --> 0:26:54,820
 We changed that a little bit, so now we have some mirrors that will take care of all the pointing.

433
0:26:55,420 --> 0:27:00,320
 But nevertheless, we received the beacon laser in this camera,

434
0:27:01,040 --> 0:27:06,160
 and we didn't know how the satellite is aligned to the ground station.

435
0:27:06,160 --> 0:27:08,160
 So we decided to use a telescope to see how it works on Earth.

436
0:27:08,980 --> 0:27:14,940
 And just to stay in the whole realm of commercial products,

437
0:27:15,620 --> 0:27:17,020
 this is our ground station.

438
0:27:17,800 --> 0:27:20,640
 It's a big telescope.

439
0:27:21,000 --> 0:27:30,500
 Well, it's 10 or 12 inches, so it's for the serious amateur, I guess.

440
0:27:31,040 --> 0:27:34,680
 But it is off the shelf.

441
0:27:36,160 --> 0:27:38,160
 So it's a telescope.

442
0:27:38,160 --> 0:27:43,160
 We, of course, we modified it a bit, but that's the basis of our ground station.

443
0:27:43,160 --> 0:27:46,160
 Now you'll get another drawing that you probably can't see,

444
0:27:46,160 --> 0:27:52,160
 but I did the same trick again, so I don't know if it's better,

445
0:27:52,160 --> 0:27:55,160
 but this is the whole ground segment.

446
0:27:55,160 --> 0:28:02,160
 We have the telescope that will both send out the beacon laser towards the spacecraft,

447
0:28:02,160 --> 0:28:05,160
 but also receive that downlink laser.

448
0:28:05,160 --> 0:28:05,440
 So, this is the telescope that will both send out the beacon laser towards the spacecraft, but also receive that downlink laser.

449
0:28:05,440 --> 0:28:06,440
 So, this is the telescope that will both send out the beacon laser towards the spacecraft, but also receive that downlink laser.

450
0:28:06,440 --> 0:28:07,440
 So, this is the telescope that will both send out the beacon laser towards the spacecraft, but also receive that downlink laser.

451
0:28:07,440 --> 0:28:22,440
 And the laser goes into something called, well, it's just a very sensitive photodiode,

452
0:28:22,440 --> 0:28:25,440
 which we use to demodulate the signal.

453
0:28:30,440 --> 0:28:34,440
 And then a whole lot of stuff going on,

454
0:28:34,440 --> 0:28:41,440
 but again, it's built up around this commercial telescope and then just a small box.

455
0:28:41,440 --> 0:28:50,440
 And this, now I'll just shortly cover the fine steering.

456
0:28:50,440 --> 0:28:54,440
 That means the way we steer the beam from the spacecraft,

457
0:28:54,440 --> 0:28:59,440
 and that's one of the areas where we run into quite some issues.

458
0:28:59,440 --> 0:29:03,440
 This is a MEMS mirror.

459
0:29:03,440 --> 0:29:05,440
 I don't know if you are familiar with MEMS devices,

460
0:29:05,440 --> 0:29:08,440
 but they are in gyroscopes and all other things.

461
0:29:08,440 --> 0:29:15,440
 And they, I mean, this is a perfect mirror for some applications at least.

462
0:29:15,440 --> 0:29:17,440
 Just to go back to this image again,

463
0:29:17,440 --> 0:29:21,440
 the mirror replaces the whole right box.

464
0:29:21,440 --> 0:29:23,440
 So, we don't, it doesn't move the optics,

465
0:29:23,440 --> 0:29:28,440
 it just moves the beam, just to.

466
0:29:28,440 --> 0:29:32,440
 But, so, this is one of the areas where you,

467
0:29:32,440 --> 0:29:35,440
 need to remember that we are in space.

468
0:29:35,440 --> 0:29:39,440
 The beam is just about one watt, the downlink beam.

469
0:29:39,440 --> 0:29:41,440
 It's not that much.

470
0:29:41,440 --> 0:29:44,440
 But due to the way that MEMS devices work,

471
0:29:44,440 --> 0:29:51,440
 this small mirror, it's about eight millimeters in diameter.

472
0:29:51,440 --> 0:29:54,440
 It needs to have a very, very low mass,

473
0:29:54,440 --> 0:29:57,440
 because these MEMS motors, at least not,

474
0:29:57,440 --> 0:30:00,440
 these types are not very powerful.

475
0:30:00,440 --> 0:30:01,440
 So.

476
0:30:01,440 --> 0:30:04,440
 And we need to move it quite rapidly.

477
0:30:04,440 --> 0:30:06,440
 Not like we are scanning,

478
0:30:06,440 --> 0:30:09,440
 but we need to keep up with different things.

479
0:30:09,440 --> 0:30:10,440
 So.

480
0:30:10,440 --> 0:30:14,440
 We have one watt laser hitting a very, very light mirror.

481
0:30:14,440 --> 0:30:17,440
 And we don't have any air.

482
0:30:17,440 --> 0:30:20,440
 So, this mirror is extremely shiny,

483
0:30:20,440 --> 0:30:23,440
 or reflective, as you probably see.

484
0:30:23,440 --> 0:30:27,440
 But there is a small loss.

485
0:30:27,440 --> 0:30:30,440
 And this small loss is converted into heat,

486
0:30:30,440 --> 0:30:34,440
 and the mass is almost nothing.

487
0:30:34,440 --> 0:30:38,440
 So, if we try to do this,

488
0:30:38,440 --> 0:30:42,440
 we will end up with a burning mirror very quickly.

489
0:30:42,440 --> 0:30:47,440
 And now we go into the part of the presentation

490
0:30:47,440 --> 0:30:49,440
 I can't go into.

491
0:30:49,440 --> 0:30:52,440
 But we did solve this.

492
0:30:52,440 --> 0:30:57,440
 I can tell you a bit about some of the things we tried

493
0:30:57,440 --> 0:30:59,440
 and failed miserably.

494
0:31:00,440 --> 0:31:05,440
 We tried to encase the mirror in a small box

495
0:31:05,440 --> 0:31:06,440
 with a window in it,

496
0:31:06,440 --> 0:31:10,440
 and fill it with an atmosphere of helium, I think.

497
0:31:10,440 --> 0:31:11,440
 Can you remember?

498
0:31:11,440 --> 0:31:13,440
 No, nitrogen, of course.

499
0:31:13,440 --> 0:31:19,440
 Trying to make use of convection.

500
0:31:19,440 --> 0:31:21,440
 And, yeah.

501
0:31:21,440 --> 0:31:24,440
 That wasn't a success.

502
0:31:24,440 --> 0:31:29,440
 We also tried to get piezo actuators.

503
0:31:29,440 --> 0:31:31,440
 They are very powerful,

504
0:31:31,440 --> 0:31:34,440
 and they can easily move a big mirror,

505
0:31:34,440 --> 0:31:36,440
 and a heat sink,

506
0:31:36,440 --> 0:31:38,440
 and the whole desk.

507
0:31:38,440 --> 0:31:40,440
 But the way they work,

508
0:31:40,440 --> 0:31:43,440
 they only move, like,

509
0:31:43,440 --> 0:31:46,440
 almost at the nanometer scale.

510
0:31:46,440 --> 0:31:48,440
 Meaning that,

511
0:31:48,440 --> 0:31:51,440
 and they have an expected lifetime of,

512
0:31:51,440 --> 0:31:56,440
 a certain amount of millions of movements they can do.

513
0:31:56,440 --> 0:31:59,440
 So, if you try to use a project like this,

514
0:31:59,440 --> 0:32:01,440
 in our case,

515
0:32:01,440 --> 0:32:02,440
 it will stop,

516
0:32:02,440 --> 0:32:04,440
 it will be at the end of life

517
0:32:04,440 --> 0:32:06,440
 in about 15 minutes.

518
0:32:06,440 --> 0:32:09,440
 Because it's sort of a technology

519
0:32:09,440 --> 0:32:12,440
 that's used for more stationary objects.

520
0:32:12,440 --> 0:32:16,440
 So, yeah.

521
0:32:16,440 --> 0:32:19,440
 A little bit about the future.

522
0:32:19,440 --> 0:32:24,440
 We hope to fly this prototype next year.

523
0:32:24,440 --> 0:32:26,440
 We have passed something called

524
0:32:26,440 --> 0:32:28,440
 a critical design review,

525
0:32:28,440 --> 0:32:30,440
 actually last year.

526
0:32:30,440 --> 0:32:32,440
 Then due to COVID and other stuff,

527
0:32:32,440 --> 0:32:36,440
 we have not been working that much

528
0:32:36,440 --> 0:32:37,440
 as of lately,

529
0:32:37,440 --> 0:32:39,440
 but now it's picking up again.

530
0:32:39,440 --> 0:32:41,440
 We have some,

531
0:32:41,440 --> 0:32:44,440
 we're working right now on the flight model.

532
0:32:44,440 --> 0:32:46,440
 So, now we have everything lined up

533
0:32:46,440 --> 0:32:49,440
 at a breadboard level.

534
0:32:49,440 --> 0:32:52,440
 Both the electronics and the optical systems.

535
0:32:52,440 --> 0:32:55,440
 And now we're integrating the whole,

536
0:32:55,440 --> 0:32:57,440
 yeah, this square meter of stuff

537
0:32:57,440 --> 0:33:01,440
 into a small box.

538
0:33:01,440 --> 0:33:02,440
 With some luck,

539
0:33:02,440 --> 0:33:06,440
 this work will be done around Christmas.

540
0:33:06,440 --> 0:33:10,440
 And then if we pass all the reviews and tests,

541
0:33:10,440 --> 0:33:12,440
 then we just have to wait

542
0:33:12,440 --> 0:33:16,440
 for a launch opportunity.

543
0:33:16,440 --> 0:33:18,440
 It could be with a rocket,

544
0:33:18,440 --> 0:33:23,440
 it could also be tossed out of the window of the ISS.

545
0:33:23,440 --> 0:33:27,440
 It's up to ESA to give us this opportunity.

546
0:33:27,440 --> 0:33:29,440
 So, yeah.

547
0:33:29,440 --> 0:33:34,440
 And this was about 10 minutes less than expected.

548
0:33:34,440 --> 0:33:37,440
 But again, I'm sorry I couldn't tell you much

549
0:33:37,440 --> 0:33:39,440
 about everything.

550
0:33:39,440 --> 0:33:41,440
 But if there's any questions,

551
0:33:41,440 --> 0:33:43,440
 let me know.

552
0:33:43,440 --> 0:33:44,440
 Any questions?

553
0:33:44,440 --> 0:33:46,440
 Yeah, we can start up here.

554
0:33:46,440 --> 0:33:50,440
 How do you deal with atmospheric refractions?

555
0:33:50,440 --> 0:33:53,440
 Because you don't have a kind of reference laser

556
0:33:53,440 --> 0:33:55,440
 that tells you about the state of the atmosphere

557
0:33:55,440 --> 0:33:56,440
 to compensate for that.

558
0:33:56,440 --> 0:33:59,440
 Disturbances?

559
0:33:59,440 --> 0:34:00,440
 Yeah.

560
0:34:00,440 --> 0:34:05,440
 So, we,

561
0:34:05,440 --> 0:34:09,440
 for the first tests and so on,

562
0:34:09,440 --> 0:34:13,440
 we are going to see how it goes.

563
0:34:13,440 --> 0:34:18,440
 But you can do like doing the big telescopes

564
0:34:18,440 --> 0:34:20,440
 with adaptive optics

565
0:34:20,440 --> 0:34:23,440
 and having a laser pointing towards the sky

566
0:34:23,440 --> 0:34:25,440
 and measuring the surface.

567
0:34:25,440 --> 0:34:28,440
 So, it's not going to be a big disturbance.

568
0:34:28,440 --> 0:34:33,440
 So, it will probably be needed in a commercial setting.

569
0:34:33,440 --> 0:34:36,440
 We chose 1064 nanometers.

570
0:34:36,440 --> 0:34:39,440
 We could also use a 1550 like you use in telecom.

571
0:34:39,440 --> 0:34:44,440
 Both of those frequencies are almost not dampened

572
0:34:44,440 --> 0:34:46,440
 by the atmosphere.

573
0:34:46,440 --> 0:34:48,440
 It will still be disturbed,

574
0:34:48,440 --> 0:34:50,440
 but there's not much absorption.

575
0:34:55,440 --> 0:35:01,440
 You told us there's like a 100 meter spot.

576
0:35:01,440 --> 0:35:03,440
 You have following and tracking.

577
0:35:03,440 --> 0:35:06,440
 But what's the window of time you can communicate

578
0:35:06,440 --> 0:35:08,440
 before you get out of reach

579
0:35:08,440 --> 0:35:12,440
 because there's a 7.5 kilometer per second going by?

580
0:35:12,440 --> 0:35:15,440
 It depends on the orbit.

581
0:35:15,440 --> 0:35:19,440
 Also, if we're standing here

582
0:35:19,440 --> 0:35:21,440
 and the satellite goes above us,

583
0:35:21,440 --> 0:35:23,440
 it can be way out on the horizon

584
0:35:23,440 --> 0:35:24,440
 and we only have a horizon.

585
0:35:24,440 --> 0:35:26,440
 And we only have a very limited time

586
0:35:26,440 --> 0:35:29,440
 or it can go right above us.

587
0:35:29,440 --> 0:35:35,440
 And it also depends on the height of the orbit.

588
0:35:35,440 --> 0:35:40,440
 But we designed the system

589
0:35:40,440 --> 0:35:44,440
 to get about four or five minutes window.

590
0:35:44,440 --> 0:35:47,440
 If we get very low into the horizon,

591
0:35:47,440 --> 0:35:50,440
 even though I said it's 1064 nanometers,

592
0:35:50,440 --> 0:35:53,440
 it doesn't get absorbed that much by the atmosphere.

593
0:35:54,440 --> 0:35:56,440
 Just like when you have the sunset,

594
0:35:56,440 --> 0:35:59,440
 when the light has to go through a lot more air,

595
0:35:59,440 --> 0:36:03,440
 it gets dampened a lot more.

596
0:36:03,440 --> 0:36:05,440
 Just a few minutes.

597
0:36:05,440 --> 0:36:09,440
 Any more questions?

598
0:36:09,440 --> 0:36:11,440
 No?

599
0:36:11,440 --> 0:36:12,440
 Thank you very much.

600
0:36:12,440 --> 0:36:13,440
 Thanks for having me.
