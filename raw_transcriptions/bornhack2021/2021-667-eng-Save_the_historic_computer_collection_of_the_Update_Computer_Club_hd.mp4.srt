 Hi, I'm Celta Field from the Update Computer Club and I want to tell you a little bit about

2
0:00:12,240 --> 0:00:16,280
 the problem we have with our collection of historic computers.

3
0:00:16,280 --> 0:00:20,680
 Unfortunately I could not be here today or otherwise I would have loved to talk to you

4
0:00:20,680 --> 0:00:27,540
 vintage computing fans at the vintage computing meetup this evening in the bar area.

5
0:00:27,540 --> 0:00:29,980
 So what is Update?

6
0:00:29,980 --> 0:00:32,980
 Update was founded as a student club.

7
0:00:32,980 --> 0:00:37,720
 Now my neighbor started drilling, I'm very sorry for the background noise.

8
0:00:37,720 --> 0:00:43,740
 It was founded at Uppsala University in Sweden already in the 1980s.

9
0:00:43,740 --> 0:00:49,720
 And its aim is to promote interest in and broaden knowledge about the field of computing.

10
0:00:49,720 --> 0:00:55,480
 It is located in the basement of the IT department and at the moment has about 80 to 90 members.

11
0:00:55,480 --> 0:00:59,960
 Most of the members are students, but there are also a lot of alumni that are students.

12
0:00:59,960 --> 0:01:03,960
 So I'm still in touch with Update.

13
0:01:03,960 --> 0:01:06,340
 What does Update do?

14
0:01:06,340 --> 0:01:08,320
 We have several rooms.

15
0:01:08,320 --> 0:01:16,420
 Some of them are used for students for working on their homework and exchanging knowledge.

16
0:01:16,420 --> 0:01:19,340
 And we have a library there as well.

17
0:01:19,340 --> 0:01:27,860
 And we use our space to organize lectures, conferences, workshops, and our computers

18
0:01:27,860 --> 0:01:28,960
 are also shown to the public in action.

19
0:01:28,960 --> 0:01:29,960
 And we have a library there as well.

20
0:01:29,960 --> 0:01:30,960
 And we have a library there as well.

21
0:01:30,960 --> 0:01:32,280
 And of course we also have social activities.

22
0:01:32,280 --> 0:01:34,680
 And of course we also have social activities.

23
0:01:34,680 --> 0:01:44,360
 We have a server hall where we run both modern and historic hardware.

24
0:01:44,360 --> 0:01:48,520
 Here you can see our rooms.

25
0:01:48,520 --> 0:01:54,760
 This is the terminal hall where we sit and hang out and talk about computer stuff.

26
0:01:54,760 --> 0:01:58,960
 And there is also one of our very special collection items, Elsa, the PDP-12, which

27
0:01:58,960 --> 0:02:08,580
 What you can see here is the server room, it is about 32 square meters big.

28
0:02:08,580 --> 0:02:14,200
 Not all of the computers there are running 24-7, some of the old computers are online

29
0:02:14,200 --> 0:02:18,840
 only sometimes.

30
0:02:18,840 --> 0:02:24,700
 And here in the hallway we have an exhibition about some of the computers, but we also have

31
0:02:24,700 --> 0:02:30,820
 exhibitions in other rooms of the university and also sometimes in completely different

32
0:02:30,820 --> 0:02:32,900
 locations.

33
0:02:32,900 --> 0:02:40,980
 And then back here we have several storage rooms.

34
0:02:40,980 --> 0:02:45,840
 Our computer collection contains basically everything from microcomputers to entry-level

35
0:02:45,840 --> 0:02:51,880
 supercomputers and it also spans a very long time frame.

36
0:02:51,880 --> 0:02:54,620
 The earliest items are from the 60s.

37
0:02:54,620 --> 0:03:03,940
 And we even got one IBM 026 keypunch from 1949 recently.

38
0:03:03,940 --> 0:03:09,460
 We don't just have the computers, but we also have software, documentation, peripherals,

39
0:03:09,460 --> 0:03:12,940
 everything you need to actually use the computers.

40
0:03:12,940 --> 0:03:14,940
 And we try to keep them running.

41
0:03:14,940 --> 0:03:19,820
 So we sometimes replace modules or solder things that broke.

42
0:03:19,820 --> 0:03:22,820
 So, yes.

43
0:03:22,820 --> 0:03:23,820
 We actively use them.

44
0:03:23,820 --> 0:03:24,020
 We have a lot of them.

45
0:03:24,020 --> 0:03:24,220
 We have a lot of them.

46
0:03:24,220 --> 0:03:24,320
 We have a lot of them.

47
0:03:24,320 --> 0:03:24,420
 We have a lot of them.

48
0:03:24,420 --> 0:03:24,580
 We have a lot of them.

49
0:03:24,580 --> 0:03:24,620
 We have a lot of them.

50
0:03:24,620 --> 0:03:25,080
 We have a lot of them.

51
0:03:25,080 --> 0:03:25,620
 We have a lot of them.

52
0:03:25,620 --> 0:03:26,620
 We have a lot of them.

53
0:03:26,620 --> 0:03:27,620
 We use these things.

54
0:03:27,620 --> 0:03:29,620
 We don't just put them there to collect dust.

55
0:03:29,620 --> 0:03:35,620
 And we would like to run a small computer museum in the future, where we can present

56
0:03:35,620 --> 0:03:39,620
 running computers.

57
0:03:39,620 --> 0:03:40,620
 Some of our computers.

58
0:03:40,620 --> 0:03:47,620
 I don't want to go through all of them in detail, but you can find all of them and some

59
0:03:47,620 --> 0:03:49,620
 background information on them in our wiki.

60
0:03:49,620 --> 0:03:50,620
 It's in Swedish, but just use Google Translate or something.

61
0:03:50,620 --> 0:03:51,620
 And then you have all the information on them in our wiki.

62
0:03:51,620 --> 0:03:52,620
 It's in Swedish, but just use Google Translate or something.

63
0:03:52,620 --> 0:03:53,620
 All the information is there.

64
0:03:53,620 --> 0:03:54,580
 And if you want to have a look at them, you can.

65
0:03:54,580 --> 0:04:01,340
 So what's the problem?

66
0:04:01,340 --> 0:04:05,460
 Well the IT department is going to move to a new building at the end of this year and

67
0:04:05,460 --> 0:04:08,180
 we will lose our current rooms.

68
0:04:08,180 --> 0:04:14,540
 They have so far been very generously providing rooms, electricity and internet for us.

69
0:04:14,540 --> 0:04:19,800
 But in the future we will ourselves need to finance them and we need at least 60 square

70
0:04:19,800 --> 0:04:25,660
 meters, better 150 square meters so we can make use of the computers, because of course

71
0:04:25,660 --> 0:04:31,820
 they take up a lot of space and if you want to run them and work on them even more.

72
0:04:31,820 --> 0:04:37,000
 And on top of the rent of course we have to finance the electricity and everything that

73
0:04:37,000 --> 0:04:42,700
 comes with running a hackerspace basically.

74
0:04:42,700 --> 0:04:48,980
 But so far unfortunately there was no real interest from the university or from the municipality

75
0:04:48,980 --> 0:04:49,780
 to further...

76
0:04:49,780 --> 0:04:52,260
 support us.

77
0:04:52,260 --> 0:04:55,600
 So we're asking you for help.

78
0:04:55,600 --> 0:04:58,740
 Please support us by becoming a member.

79
0:04:58,740 --> 0:05:10,480
 For approximately 1000 crowns per year or 725 Danish crowns or 97 euros we can get about

80
0:05:10,480 --> 0:05:15,020
 a square meter per year, but the membership fee is flexible, you can pay what you want

81
0:05:15,020 --> 0:05:19,640
 or donate or help us find sponsors or just tell others about us.

82
0:05:19,640 --> 0:05:27,640
 Thanks, I hope you were interested in this, please get in touch if you have questions

83
0:05:27,640 --> 0:05:28,520
 and thanks for coming.
