0:00:00,000 --> 0:00:29,980
 Thank you very much.

2
0:00:30,000 --> 0:00:30,920
 Ubuntu phones.

3
0:00:35,000 --> 0:00:36,000
 Okay, hi.

4
0:00:36,460 --> 0:00:37,020
 Welcome.

5
0:00:37,260 --> 0:00:38,180
 Can everybody hear me?

6
0:00:40,420 --> 0:00:42,260
 Those who cannot, please say yes.

7
0:00:43,460 --> 0:00:45,120
 Just to make things more confusing.

8
0:00:45,380 --> 0:00:48,020
 So Ubuntu Touch, what isn't it?

9
0:00:49,260 --> 0:00:50,700
 Ubuntu Touch is not Android.

10
0:00:51,520 --> 0:00:52,800
 Ubuntu Touch is not iOS.

11
0:00:53,380 --> 0:00:54,780
 It's not desktop Ubuntu.

12
0:00:55,660 --> 0:00:57,640
 I'm sorry if this disappoints any of you.

13
0:00:58,200 --> 0:00:59,960
 It shares a base with Android.

14
0:00:59,980 --> 0:01:01,980
 But not very much else.

15
0:01:02,860 --> 0:01:04,180
 It does not phone home to Google.

16
0:01:05,160 --> 0:01:06,860
 Which is a thing that I like.

17
0:01:07,640 --> 0:01:10,060
 It does not phone home to Apple.

18
0:01:11,420 --> 0:01:13,120
 So what is Ubuntu Touch?

19
0:01:13,380 --> 0:01:15,980
 It is an OS made for mobile devices.

20
0:01:17,820 --> 0:01:23,080
 It runs on 64, no, currently 65 devices.

21
0:01:23,600 --> 0:01:23,980
 Mostly smartphones.

22
0:01:24,840 --> 0:01:26,040
 Some are tablets.

23
0:01:27,040 --> 0:01:28,140
 It's easy to use.

24
0:01:28,240 --> 0:01:28,840
 It's elegant.

25
0:01:28,840 --> 0:01:28,960
 It's elegant.

26
0:01:28,960 --> 0:01:34,880
 There's a show and tell device making its way through the seat.

27
0:01:34,980 --> 0:01:37,840
 So you can just take a look and touch it if you like.

28
0:01:38,100 --> 0:01:40,060
 Just swipe and do whatever you like.

29
0:01:42,540 --> 0:01:45,700
 It comes with a pretty decent set of installable apps.

30
0:01:46,140 --> 0:01:50,640
 There is the possibility to run some desktop apps through something called Libertine.

31
0:01:51,740 --> 0:01:54,340
 But most of them do not run well on a small screen.

32
0:01:54,860 --> 0:01:57,060
 And they're not made for a touch interface anyway.

33
0:01:58,960 --> 0:02:00,960
 So, how did Ubuntu Touch come about?

34
0:02:00,960 --> 0:02:10,960
 The development began in 2011 at Canonical, which you've probably all heard of, the Ubuntu people.

35
0:02:10,960 --> 0:02:15,960
 And it was meant to be Ubuntu plus convergence.

36
0:02:15,960 --> 0:02:21,960
 So bringing the same OS to phones, tablets, smart TVs, and all kinds of interesting things.

37
0:02:21,960 --> 0:02:25,960
 And this somehow never quite materialized.

38
0:02:25,960 --> 0:02:27,880
 So by 2013, Ubuntu Touch was launched.

39
0:02:27,880 --> 0:02:28,960
 It was the first mobile device in the world.

40
0:02:28,960 --> 0:02:33,960
 It came to release of a version that could be used on a small number of smartphones.

41
0:02:35,960 --> 0:02:39,960
 And it was released to manufacturers in 2014.

42
0:02:40,960 --> 0:02:47,960
 Then in 2015 came the BQ Aquarius, which is now currently in the hands of one of you.

43
0:02:47,960 --> 0:02:52,960
 And it was manufactured right away with Ubuntu Touch on it.

44
0:02:52,960 --> 0:02:54,960
 So it's pretty unique that way.

45
0:02:55,960 --> 0:02:57,960
 And it's a really cute little thing.

46
0:02:58,960 --> 0:03:02,960
 And it went on sale in February 2015.

47
0:03:02,960 --> 0:03:07,960
 But it didn't all quite work out as planned.

48
0:03:07,960 --> 0:03:11,960
 By 2017, Canonical announced they would drop the project.

49
0:03:11,960 --> 0:03:15,960
 And it was then taken over by the community.

50
0:03:15,960 --> 0:03:19,960
 So there was a foundation started called UBports.

51
0:03:19,960 --> 0:03:25,960
 And they got the code and they got the right to use the name, which is quite a big thing.

52
0:03:25,960 --> 0:03:27,960
 And the styling of Ubuntu.

53
0:03:28,960 --> 0:03:35,960
 They started a community with forums, telegram groups, and so on.

54
0:03:35,960 --> 0:03:41,960
 And then in 2018, they reached OTA 4.

55
0:03:41,960 --> 0:03:50,960
 The upgrade that brought us to the base of Ubuntu 16.04 instead of 15.04.

56
0:03:50,960 --> 0:03:52,960
 So that was pretty good.

57
0:03:52,960 --> 0:03:55,960
 So that's the past.

58
0:03:55,960 --> 0:03:57,960
 And what about the future?

59
0:03:57,960 --> 0:04:03,960
 The future means Ubuntu 20.04, which is a bit late, I know.

60
0:04:03,960 --> 0:04:05,960
 They're working really hard on it.

61
0:04:05,960 --> 0:04:08,960
 And they're very sorry, but it's going to be great.

62
0:04:08,960 --> 0:04:13,960
 And there's also something interesting called WayDroid.

63
0:04:13,960 --> 0:04:18,960
 WayDroid is sort of an improved version of NBox, which you may have heard of.

64
0:04:18,960 --> 0:04:24,960
 NBox is meant to allow running Android apps on Ubuntu Touch.

65
0:04:24,960 --> 0:04:26,960
 But it didn't work very well.

66
0:04:27,960 --> 0:04:38,960
 So WayDroid is a much improved version of NBox, which will make it possible to run a lot more Android apps on Ubuntu Touch.

67
0:04:38,960 --> 0:04:40,960
 So that's pretty good news.

68
0:04:40,960 --> 0:04:44,960
 So who are the people making this happen?

69
0:04:44,960 --> 0:04:46,960
 They're the foundation called UBports.

70
0:04:46,960 --> 0:04:49,960
 And they're located in Germany.

71
0:04:49,960 --> 0:04:54,960
 And they have a cute logo, which is always a good thing.

72
0:04:54,960 --> 0:04:56,960
 And the developers are very approachable.

73
0:04:56,960 --> 0:04:58,960
 They're easy to talk to.

74
0:04:58,960 --> 0:05:00,960
 They have regular Q&A sessions.

75
0:05:00,960 --> 0:05:04,960
 You can just message them, and they'll answer.

76
0:05:04,960 --> 0:05:08,960
 They're pretty decent folks, and they're an international bunch as well.

77
0:05:08,960 --> 0:05:12,960
 There's this community, and there's a forum and everything.

78
0:05:12,960 --> 0:05:15,960
 And a lot of people in there also contribute.

79
0:05:15,960 --> 0:05:21,960
 So it's really made by the community, which is pretty cool, I think.

80
0:05:21,960 --> 0:05:25,960
 But then, how did I get involved?

81
0:05:26,960 --> 0:05:30,960
 Oops, I was forgetting to press the buttons.

82
0:05:30,960 --> 0:05:34,960
 So why was I interested in Ubuntu Touch at all?

83
0:05:34,960 --> 0:05:39,960
 Well, I've always been Google-averse.

84
0:05:39,960 --> 0:05:42,960
 I've always disliked the big G.

85
0:05:42,960 --> 0:05:47,960
 And I've been using Linux since 2015.

86
0:05:47,960 --> 0:05:49,960
 You can laugh if you want.

87
0:05:49,960 --> 0:05:51,960
 Thank you.

88
0:05:51,960 --> 0:05:55,960
 I've been using an old black phone that I got for cheap.

89
0:05:55,960 --> 0:05:58,960
 Hoping it would improve my privacy.

90
0:05:58,960 --> 0:06:03,960
 Then I got into Lineage OS, which was pretty good.

91
0:06:03,960 --> 0:06:07,960
 But I wanted something even more Google-free.

92
0:06:07,960 --> 0:06:11,960
 And I don't use a lot of Android apps anyway.

93
0:06:11,960 --> 0:06:15,960
 So I heard about Ubuntu Touch, and it sounded neat.

94
0:06:15,960 --> 0:06:18,960
 It sounded like it was easy to install.

95
0:06:18,960 --> 0:06:20,960
 There was a GUI installer.

96
0:06:20,960 --> 0:06:21,960
 Yay, clicky things.

97
0:06:21,960 --> 0:06:23,960
 I like clicky things.

98
0:06:23,960 --> 0:06:24,960
 And...

99
0:06:25,960 --> 0:06:26,960
 Yeah.

100
0:06:26,960 --> 0:06:33,960
 So I happened to have a very well-supported device, which is the OnePlus One.

101
0:06:33,960 --> 0:06:37,960
 Which is a very decent piece of hardware still, even now.

102
0:06:37,960 --> 0:06:42,960
 It's better than it has any right to be at the price people paid for it.

103
0:06:42,960 --> 0:06:43,960
 It's just outdated.

104
0:06:43,960 --> 0:06:48,960
 Well, not with Ubuntu Touch it isn't.

105
0:06:48,960 --> 0:06:50,960
 So I managed to install it.

106
0:06:50,960 --> 0:06:51,960
 Whoo!

107
0:06:51,960 --> 0:06:53,960
 To my own surprise.

108
0:06:53,960 --> 0:06:56,960
 And I just wanted to try it out for two weeks.

109
0:06:56,960 --> 0:06:59,960
 And it's been more than a year since.

110
0:06:59,960 --> 0:07:02,960
 Those two weeks are ongoing.

111
0:07:02,960 --> 0:07:06,960
 I'm not exactly sure what happened here, but I do think I like it.

112
0:07:08,960 --> 0:07:10,960
 Well, why do I like it?

113
0:07:11,960 --> 0:07:14,960
 Okay, there is a lot of purple.

114
0:07:16,960 --> 0:07:18,960
 It really is easy to use.

115
0:07:18,960 --> 0:07:20,960
 It's easy to get used to.

116
0:07:20,960 --> 0:07:22,960
 Swiping is everything here.

117
0:07:23,960 --> 0:07:27,960
 Different from Android in very pleasant ways.

118
0:07:27,960 --> 0:07:29,960
 The learning curve is short.

119
0:07:29,960 --> 0:07:30,960
 It feels friendly.

120
0:07:30,960 --> 0:07:31,960
 It feels polished.

121
0:07:31,960 --> 0:07:33,960
 It feels well thought out.

122
0:07:33,960 --> 0:07:35,960
 There's a community.

123
0:07:35,960 --> 0:07:36,960
 It's friendly.

124
0:07:36,960 --> 0:07:37,960
 It's welcoming.

125
0:07:37,960 --> 0:07:38,960
 It's not commercial.

126
0:07:38,960 --> 0:07:40,960
 I like that.

127
0:07:40,960 --> 0:07:42,960
 It's privacy focused.

128
0:07:42,960 --> 0:07:45,960
 It makes you feel like you're in control of your device.

129
0:07:46,960 --> 0:07:48,960
 So that's all very positive.

130
0:07:48,960 --> 0:07:50,960
 And I'm not even getting paid for this.

131
0:07:50,960 --> 0:07:52,960
 But what do I not like about it?

132
0:07:53,960 --> 0:07:57,960
 Okay, apart from the purple, there's a fair deal of orange.

133
0:07:58,960 --> 0:08:00,960
 I don't like orange all that much.

134
0:08:02,960 --> 0:08:05,960
 It cannot be used on every smartphone.

135
0:08:05,960 --> 0:08:08,960
 So you would need to get a suitable device.

136
0:08:08,960 --> 0:08:11,960
 That's a bit of a shame, but they're working on it.

137
0:08:11,960 --> 0:08:16,960
 The app you may want may not or not yet exist.

138
0:08:17,960 --> 0:08:22,960
 My personal bugbear is that the UT app for Signal is unfinished.

139
0:08:22,960 --> 0:08:24,960
 And missing features.

140
0:08:24,960 --> 0:08:33,960
 If anyone's interested and competent in app development or encryption algorithms and want to help, please hit me up after I'm done.

141
0:08:33,960 --> 0:08:34,960
 Please.

142
0:08:36,960 --> 0:08:40,960
 So what is it like?

143
0:08:40,960 --> 0:08:42,960
 Because that's what you want to know, right?

144
0:08:44,960 --> 0:08:46,960
 There's no home screen.

145
0:08:46,960 --> 0:08:48,960
 That's really different.

146
0:08:48,960 --> 0:08:50,960
 It looks like Unity, to be honest.

147
0:08:50,960 --> 0:08:51,960
 Doesn't it?

148
0:08:52,960 --> 0:08:54,960
 It looks like Unity.

149
0:08:54,960 --> 0:08:58,960
 It has a launcher that shows a row of your favorite apps.

150
0:08:58,960 --> 0:09:00,960
 Yes, you can edit that.

151
0:09:00,960 --> 0:09:06,960
 So this version of Unity is called Lomiri, and it was developed especially for Ubuntu Touch.

152
0:09:06,960 --> 0:09:14,960
 And besides the launcher that you're seeing, is there an app drawer that holds all of your apps.

153
0:09:14,960 --> 0:09:20,960
 And if you are a bit set in your Android ways, like I was,

154
0:09:20,960 --> 0:09:26,960
 you can install one of several apps that does give you a more conventional home screen.

155
0:09:26,960 --> 0:09:30,960
 So you could have all the buttons you want right there.

156
0:09:30,960 --> 0:09:32,960
 I won't judge.

157
0:09:32,960 --> 0:09:34,960
 I do it myself.

158
0:09:34,960 --> 0:09:38,960
 So it's a really swipe-centric OS.

159
0:09:38,960 --> 0:09:40,960
 It's all about the swiping.

160
0:09:40,960 --> 0:09:44,960
 You can do things by swiping from the edges of the screen inwards.

161
0:09:44,960 --> 0:09:48,960
 Sometimes a long swipe does a different thing than a short swipe.

162
0:09:48,960 --> 0:09:52,960
 You can swipe from the bottom to get different options.

163
0:09:52,960 --> 0:09:58,960
 Long swiping from the right edge...

164
0:09:58,960 --> 0:10:02,960
 No, short swiping first, that takes you back to the previously used app.

165
0:10:02,960 --> 0:10:06,960
 So that's like a back button, which it doesn't have.

166
0:10:06,960 --> 0:10:11,960
 But if you go from the right for a long swipe, then you get the concertina view,

167
0:10:11,960 --> 0:10:15,960
 which you are seeing here, which I think looks pretty Linux-y.

168
0:10:15,960 --> 0:10:17,960
 Pretty cool.

169
0:10:17,960 --> 0:10:20,960
 It's a good way to impress people.

170
0:10:20,960 --> 0:10:23,960
 The lock screen looks really cool.

171
0:10:23,960 --> 0:10:25,960
 It has this circle.

172
0:10:25,960 --> 0:10:27,960
 The circle represents the day of the month.

173
0:10:27,960 --> 0:10:31,960
 And the petals that look like a flower represent what you've been doing all month.

174
0:10:31,960 --> 0:10:34,960
 So taking pictures, taking calls, stuff like that.

175
0:10:34,960 --> 0:10:36,960
 It's all represented there.

176
0:10:36,960 --> 0:10:39,960
 But of course you can add a different picture.

177
0:10:39,960 --> 0:10:41,960
 This is mine.

178
0:10:41,960 --> 0:10:45,960
 Which I think looks pretty neat.

179
0:10:45,960 --> 0:10:47,960
 So the lock screen is...

180
0:10:47,960 --> 0:10:49,960
 It's very specific to Ubuntu Touch.

181
0:10:49,960 --> 0:10:51,960
 Nobody else uses that.

182
0:10:53,960 --> 0:10:58,960
 So I'm sure that by now you're pretty, pretty eager to try this all out for yourself.

183
0:10:58,960 --> 0:11:02,960
 So, how do I get Ubuntu Touch?

184
0:11:02,960 --> 0:11:05,960
 Well, first you would need a supported device.

185
0:11:05,960 --> 0:11:11,960
 There's a nice big list of supported devices, which also tells you how well supported they are.

186
0:11:11,960 --> 0:11:14,960
 Can it make calls? Can you use the camera?

187
0:11:14,960 --> 0:11:16,960
 Pretty interesting stuff.

188
0:11:17,960 --> 0:11:19,960
 And there's an installer.

189
0:11:19,960 --> 0:11:22,960
 And the installer runs on a lot of computer platforms.

190
0:11:22,960 --> 0:11:24,960
 Yes, the one you're using too.

191
0:11:24,960 --> 0:11:26,960
 Probably.

192
0:11:26,960 --> 0:11:32,960
 Or you can be lazy and spend a little more money and buy a pre-installed new device.

193
0:11:32,960 --> 0:11:35,960
 There is the PinePhone. There is the Vola.

194
0:11:35,960 --> 0:11:37,960
 They're a bit...

195
0:11:37,960 --> 0:11:40,960
 Not all features work just yet.

196
0:11:40,960 --> 0:11:43,960
 They're gonna be really nice, like pretty soon.

197
0:11:43,960 --> 0:11:45,960
 Maybe not just today.

198
0:11:47,960 --> 0:11:55,960
 And the third option is to buy a used device that somebody else has already flashed to Ubuntu Touch.

199
0:11:55,960 --> 0:12:02,960
 Which is in most countries a very viable option for the lazy and works really well.

200
0:12:05,960 --> 0:12:11,960
 But your best option is probably, because of more choice, to get a supported device and flash it yourself.

201
0:12:11,960 --> 0:12:14,960
 And if I can do it, you can probably do it too.

202
0:12:14,960 --> 0:12:18,960
 This is a look at the devices page.

203
0:12:18,960 --> 0:12:20,960
 It shows you which devices are supported.

204
0:12:20,960 --> 0:12:25,960
 You'll see some right at the top, which are the best supported.

205
0:12:25,960 --> 0:12:27,960
 And the list goes on and on.

206
0:12:27,960 --> 0:12:32,960
 As you can see, this picture was not taken today, but because there's one more today.

207
0:12:32,960 --> 0:12:37,960
 And then you use the installer and it leads you through it.

208
0:12:37,960 --> 0:12:40,960
 And it pretty much always works.

209
0:12:40,960 --> 0:12:42,960
 And it's not hard.

210
0:12:42,960 --> 0:12:43,960
 And there are instructions.

211
0:12:43,960 --> 0:12:46,960
 It works fairly well.

212
0:12:46,960 --> 0:12:51,960
 So, if you're interested, where else should you look?

213
0:12:51,960 --> 0:12:54,960
 You should definitely look at this website.

214
0:12:54,960 --> 0:13:03,960
 Because this is where you find the most important information about Ubuntu Touch and all the other websites that are related follow from here.

215
0:13:06,960 --> 0:13:09,960
 So, are there any questions?

216
0:13:09,960 --> 0:13:14,960
 If they're too technical, I will not be able to answer them.

217
0:13:14,960 --> 0:13:18,960
 But I can probably point you to the place where you can get an answer.

218
0:13:18,960 --> 0:13:20,960
 Or I can ask someone else.

219
0:13:20,960 --> 0:13:21,960
 So, try me.

220
0:13:25,960 --> 0:13:29,960
 And if I don't have an answer, I can always nod and smile.

221
0:13:29,960 --> 0:13:30,960
 Okay.

222
0:13:30,960 --> 0:13:32,960
 I just tried the demo device.

223
0:13:32,960 --> 0:13:33,960
 Yes.

224
0:13:33,960 --> 0:13:38,960
 And I was able to gain root by typing sudo i without typing any password.

225
0:13:38,960 --> 0:13:42,960
 Do you know why that decision was made?

226
0:13:42,960 --> 0:13:47,960
 Most likely because I set it to not lock in any way so you folks could look at it.

227
0:13:47,960 --> 0:13:48,960
 Okay.

228
0:13:48,960 --> 0:13:49,960
 Yeah.

229
0:13:49,960 --> 0:13:51,960
 This is not standard security.

230
0:13:51,960 --> 0:13:53,960
 This is no security.

231
0:13:53,960 --> 0:13:56,960
 I also tried this.

232
0:13:56,960 --> 0:13:58,960
 I could gain root the same way.

233
0:13:58,960 --> 0:13:59,960
 Okay.

234
0:13:59,960 --> 0:14:01,960
 That's pretty interesting.

235
0:14:01,960 --> 0:14:04,960
 You have now hit the wall of my knowledge.

236
0:14:04,960 --> 0:14:05,960
 Yeah.

237
0:14:05,960 --> 0:14:07,960
 Also, on how to make a nice transparent.

238
0:14:07,960 --> 0:14:08,960
 PNG.

239
0:14:08,960 --> 0:14:09,960
 But, well.

240
0:14:09,960 --> 0:14:16,960
 By default, Ubuntu Touch is right only.

241
0:14:16,960 --> 0:14:18,960
 The root, at least, is right only.

242
0:14:18,960 --> 0:14:20,960
 So, yes, you can gain root access.

243
0:14:20,960 --> 0:14:22,960
 But you have to know how.

244
0:14:22,960 --> 0:14:23,960
 It's done.

245
0:14:23,960 --> 0:14:25,960
 It's not recommended unless you know what you're doing.

246
0:14:25,960 --> 0:14:28,960
 Which I don't.

247
0:14:28,960 --> 0:14:30,960
 So, it's not top secure.

248
0:14:30,960 --> 0:14:33,960
 And that is not what it's there for.

249
0:14:33,960 --> 0:14:36,960
 It's mostly focused on privacy more than on security.

250
0:14:36,960 --> 0:14:39,960
 There are more secure phones.

251
0:14:39,960 --> 0:14:42,960
 Does that answer your question in any way?

252
0:14:42,960 --> 0:14:44,960
 Thank you.

253
0:14:44,960 --> 0:14:45,960
 Anybody else?

254
0:14:55,960 --> 0:14:56,960
 That was talk.

255
0:14:56,960 --> 0:14:58,960
 If there are no more questions, then we're done here.

256
0:14:58,960 --> 0:15:02,960
 Well, give an applause to Noam.

257
0:15:06,960 --> 0:15:16,960
 Thank you very much.
