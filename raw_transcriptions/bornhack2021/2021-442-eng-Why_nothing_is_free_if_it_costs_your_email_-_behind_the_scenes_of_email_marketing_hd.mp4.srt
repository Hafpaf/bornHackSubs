0:00:00,000 --> 0:00:13,680
 So, I'm going to talk a bit about why nothing is free if it's cost your email.

2
0:00:14,480 --> 0:00:21,020
 So, what I'm going to cover in this talk is, first, I'm going to give you a little disclaimer.

3
0:00:21,360 --> 0:00:26,340
 I'm going to give you a very short introduction to who I am and why I'm making this talk.

4
0:00:26,340 --> 0:00:35,320
 Then, we're going to look at email marketers. Who are they? What's email marketing? Who's doing it?

5
0:00:37,140 --> 0:00:41,700
 We're going to look a bit into how do you actually end up on all these email lists.

6
0:00:42,780 --> 0:00:54,200
 And then, I'm going to take you behind the scenes in MailChimp, which is one of the very big email providers used worldwide.

7
0:00:54,780 --> 0:00:56,320
 And then, I'm going to give you a little bit of a background.

8
0:00:56,340 --> 0:01:02,140
 I'm going to give you some simple steps to make yourself track less.

9
0:01:02,760 --> 0:01:08,360
 And I'm also going to put in a few words about the upcoming iOS 15 update,

10
0:01:08,660 --> 0:01:17,300
 which will presumably make life a bit harder for the email marketers and take some privacy measurements.

11
0:01:18,980 --> 0:01:21,120
 And then, of course, we have room for questions.

12
0:01:21,120 --> 0:01:26,120
 So, first of all, this is not a GDPR conversation.

13
0:01:26,340 --> 0:01:27,340
 This is a GDPR talk.

14
0:01:27,340 --> 0:01:33,340
 When we're talking email marketing, GDPR is, of course, a huge issue.

15
0:01:33,340 --> 0:01:42,340
 And basically, most of what's going on at the moment, at least if you're using the big American providers like MailChimp,

16
0:01:42,340 --> 0:01:48,340
 and basically like most of them, and even if you're using some of the European-based ones,

17
0:01:48,340 --> 0:01:52,340
 then some of them might also use American services.

18
0:01:52,340 --> 0:01:56,340
 Most of what's going on is not GDPR compliant.

19
0:01:56,340 --> 0:01:57,340
 I know that.

20
0:01:57,340 --> 0:01:59,340
 Some of the email marketers know that.

21
0:01:59,340 --> 0:02:01,340
 Some of them don't know that.

22
0:02:01,340 --> 0:02:03,340
 But that's not what this talk is about.

23
0:02:03,340 --> 0:02:11,340
 So, also in the question section, I'm not going into any GDPR discussions because, yes, we know we have a problem.

24
0:02:11,340 --> 0:02:15,340
 No, we don't have an easy available solution right now.

25
0:02:15,340 --> 0:02:22,340
 So, I'm going to tell you what is actually possible, what can I, as an email marketer, see.

26
0:02:22,340 --> 0:02:25,340
 And then we can save the legal discussion for later.

27
0:02:25,340 --> 0:02:26,340
 Thank you.

28
0:02:26,340 --> 0:02:28,340
 For another time.

29
0:02:28,340 --> 0:02:29,340
 Yeah.

30
0:02:29,340 --> 0:02:31,340
 So, why am I here?

31
0:02:31,340 --> 0:02:35,340
 I've been running my own business since 2012.

32
0:02:35,340 --> 0:02:39,340
 Started out as a writing instructor.

33
0:02:39,340 --> 0:02:45,340
 And then decided that yelling at people in a writing arena was a bit hard to make a living,

34
0:02:45,340 --> 0:02:49,340
 especially if I wanted afternoons and evenings with my family.

35
0:02:49,340 --> 0:02:55,340
 So, in 2013, I started doing online courses on horse training and riding.

36
0:02:55,340 --> 0:02:58,340
 And we were two persons in Denmark doing that.

37
0:02:58,340 --> 0:03:11,340
 Then, from about 2015, I figured out that getting business owners to pay me instead of private persons who already spent all their money on their horses, that was a bit easier.

38
0:03:11,340 --> 0:03:18,340
 And I had a flair for the technical side of things and for explaining tech stuff to people.

39
0:03:18,340 --> 0:03:23,340
 So, since then, I've mostly been making a living on helping other people set up their online courses.

40
0:03:23,340 --> 0:03:28,340
 Their email marketing systems.

41
0:03:28,340 --> 0:03:31,340
 I use a platform called Simplero.

42
0:03:31,340 --> 0:03:35,340
 But I also use webinar platforms and stuff like that.

43
0:03:35,340 --> 0:03:46,340
 So, basically, I'm one of those evil, evil email marketers that are making a living from bombarding people's inboxes with sales mail.

44
0:03:46,340 --> 0:03:49,340
 And show me ads and stuff like that.

45
0:03:49,340 --> 0:03:51,340
 That's not the talk completely.

46
0:03:51,340 --> 0:03:52,340
 So, that's me.

47
0:03:52,340 --> 0:03:59,340
 So, what is email marketing and who's doing it?

48
0:03:59,340 --> 0:04:12,340
 Email marketing is basically everything you get in your email inbox with the aim to sell or get to know a company better.

49
0:04:12,340 --> 0:04:18,340
 It can be a regular newsletter with very little sales or with a lot of sales.

50
0:04:18,340 --> 0:04:21,340
 It can be something with videos or images.

51
0:04:21,340 --> 0:04:23,340
 Or get to know us emails.

52
0:04:23,340 --> 0:04:28,340
 Or it can be this week's special offer some people have.

53
0:04:28,340 --> 0:04:36,340
 Or companies have regular weekly or monthly or daily emails with a very specific content.

54
0:04:36,340 --> 0:04:44,340
 Other people and companies have like random, oh, I think I'm going to write an email today to my list.

55
0:04:44,340 --> 0:04:45,340
 Boom.

56
0:04:45,340 --> 0:04:46,340
 Email sent.

57
0:04:46,340 --> 0:04:48,340
 I'm probably selling something.

58
0:04:48,340 --> 0:04:50,340
 So, it's everything from very, very simple.

59
0:04:50,340 --> 0:04:57,340
 Everything from very, very organized to very random marketing.

60
0:04:57,340 --> 0:05:06,340
 Also, what the email marketers are looking at is everything from super, super organized to pretty much random.

61
0:05:06,340 --> 0:05:13,340
 Because it's like you can extract a lot of data from these systems.

62
0:05:13,340 --> 0:05:15,340
 And some people do.

63
0:05:15,340 --> 0:05:18,340
 And that's where the really not free part comes in.

64
0:05:18,340 --> 0:05:24,340
 Because it's actually amazing what I, and that was what inspired me to make this talk.

65
0:05:24,340 --> 0:05:37,340
 Because I'm actually almost a bit scared on a daily basis of what amount of data I have available about both my paying customers and those people who just signed up to one of my lists.

66
0:05:37,340 --> 0:05:40,340
 It's quite amazing.

67
0:05:40,340 --> 0:05:44,340
 So, email marketing is like a lot of different things.

68
0:05:44,340 --> 0:05:46,340
 And it's not just big evil companies doing it.

69
0:05:46,340 --> 0:05:47,340
 It's not just big companies doing it.

70
0:05:47,340 --> 0:05:51,340
 It's like, of course, lots of big companies does it.

71
0:05:51,340 --> 0:05:54,340
 And they usually do it in a more systematic way.

72
0:05:54,340 --> 0:05:58,340
 But it's also your hairdresser.

73
0:05:58,340 --> 0:06:02,340
 It's the pizzeria.

74
0:06:02,340 --> 0:06:05,340
 It's the gym.

75
0:06:05,340 --> 0:06:07,340
 The football club.

76
0:06:07,340 --> 0:06:11,340
 Everybody is using email lists.

77
0:06:11,340 --> 0:06:15,340
 And email marketing in some way.

78
0:06:15,340 --> 0:06:16,340
 That's been amazing.

79
0:06:16,340 --> 0:06:23,340
 So, there's been a lot of talk over the last many years now that, oh, well, email marketing is dead.

80
0:06:23,340 --> 0:06:30,340
 We need to only be available on social media or only send text messages and stuff.

81
0:06:30,340 --> 0:06:33,340
 And I think that's just not true.

82
0:06:33,340 --> 0:06:42,340
 There's a lot of value still in getting people's emails, being able to get directly into their inbox.

83
0:06:42,340 --> 0:06:44,340
 It has a lot of meaning.

84
0:06:44,340 --> 0:06:51,340
 So, email marketing is a lot of different things.

85
0:06:51,340 --> 0:06:58,340
 And, of course, the strategies behind email marketing is also very different.

86
0:06:58,340 --> 0:07:05,340
 Some people really have analyst settings and looking at the numbers and what do we do.

87
0:07:05,340 --> 0:07:09,340
 People open this mail and then we send them to that flow and then we do that.

88
0:07:09,340 --> 0:07:11,340
 And if they click this link, then this happens.

89
0:07:11,340 --> 0:07:13,340
 And other people are a bit more like, hey, what's going on?

90
0:07:13,340 --> 0:07:17,340
 A bit more like happy-go-lucky and, oh, someone purchased.

91
0:07:17,340 --> 0:07:19,340
 Whoa, awesome.

92
0:07:19,340 --> 0:07:41,340
 So, regardless of what those people whose list you sign up for actually do, they will have most of the data available to make these analysis and to do either general profiling and say we have this segment of list subscribers.

93
0:07:41,340 --> 0:07:42,340
 They behave like that.

94
0:07:42,340 --> 0:07:43,340
 And we have another segment.

95
0:07:43,340 --> 0:07:45,340
 They behave like this.

96
0:07:45,340 --> 0:07:49,340
 Or go in and look specifically at, oh, I know this guy.

97
0:07:49,340 --> 0:07:51,340
 He's just signed up for my list.

98
0:07:51,340 --> 0:07:53,340
 Let's see how he behaves.

99
0:07:53,340 --> 0:07:55,340
 And I think that's like the more scary part.

100
0:07:55,340 --> 0:08:02,340
 I don't mind being in a segment with 200 other people of them who always click the yellow links.

101
0:08:02,340 --> 0:08:04,340
 That's fine with me.

102
0:08:04,340 --> 0:08:09,340
 But I don't like that people can actually go in and click my name in their email list.

103
0:08:09,340 --> 0:08:11,340
 And then they can see for the past six months.

104
0:08:11,340 --> 0:08:14,340
 Any mails I opened or clicked that.

105
0:08:14,340 --> 0:08:19,340
 That's the part I'm not super happy about.

106
0:08:19,340 --> 0:08:25,340
 So, how do we get on all these email lists?

107
0:08:25,340 --> 0:08:30,340
 Yeah, well, one very popular term in email marketing is a freebie.

108
0:08:30,340 --> 0:08:34,340
 A freebie means basically something people get for free.

109
0:08:34,340 --> 0:08:40,340
 But that's, again, we agree that's a big fat lie because they pay with their email for this freebie.

110
0:08:40,340 --> 0:08:43,340
 But it's still, it's a popular tool.

111
0:08:43,340 --> 0:08:45,340
 You have to make something.

112
0:08:45,340 --> 0:08:46,340
 It can be an ebook.

113
0:08:46,340 --> 0:08:47,340
 It can be a video guide.

114
0:08:47,340 --> 0:08:49,340
 It can be a webinar.

115
0:08:49,340 --> 0:09:01,340
 As I say here, you give people something that has enough value or that they hope have enough value that they will give you their name and their email address.

116
0:09:01,340 --> 0:09:04,340
 So, that's like, that's a tradeoff.

117
0:09:04,340 --> 0:09:09,340
 I provide some content like a video guide or PDF.

118
0:09:09,340 --> 0:09:17,340
 Or a setup guide for some software or whatever it is in my business that I can say, I have this.

119
0:09:17,340 --> 0:09:19,340
 It will make a difference for people.

120
0:09:19,340 --> 0:09:22,340
 They don't need to pay me any money.

121
0:09:22,340 --> 0:09:28,340
 But I would like them to get on my email list because then I can email them, tell them more about me, get them to know me.

122
0:09:28,340 --> 0:09:31,340
 And then I can get them to purchase some of my other products.

123
0:09:31,340 --> 0:09:34,340
 Or at least I can get some of them.

124
0:09:34,340 --> 0:09:37,340
 A certain amount of the people who get on my list should.

125
0:09:37,340 --> 0:09:38,340
 Uh.

126
0:09:38,340 --> 0:09:41,340
 Turn out to be paying customers.

127
0:09:41,340 --> 0:09:48,340
 If none of the people who get on my list turn out to be paying customers, then I'm not running a very successful business.

128
0:09:48,340 --> 0:09:51,340
 So, that's like the point.

129
0:09:51,340 --> 0:09:55,340
 It can also be when you take part in competitions.

130
0:09:55,340 --> 0:09:57,340
 You need to sign your email address.

131
0:09:57,340 --> 0:09:59,340
 You do a test or quiz.

132
0:09:59,340 --> 0:10:01,340
 You purchase something online.

133
0:10:01,340 --> 0:10:07,340
 And there's like this little checkbox that, by the way, is not allowed to be checked beforehand.

134
0:10:07,340 --> 0:10:15,340
 You have to actually check it yourself on sign out that you want to subscribe to their newsletter and email marketing.

135
0:10:15,340 --> 0:10:21,340
 And then there are all those organizations who get you to sign up for something.

136
0:10:21,340 --> 0:10:27,340
 And then in very, very small lettering, it also says we're sharing this with our partners.

137
0:10:27,340 --> 0:10:34,340
 And then if you look into the details, there should be a link to some sort of privacy policy or terms.

138
0:10:34,340 --> 0:10:36,340
 And then you have this like two-page long list of things.

139
0:10:36,340 --> 0:10:41,340
 You have this like two-page long list of partners that they're sharing your email address with.

140
0:10:41,340 --> 0:10:46,340
 Then you know, okay, I'll get bombarded with offers from all kind of people.

141
0:10:46,340 --> 0:10:56,340
 So, if you see one of those, sign up with a crap email address instead of your real email address because you would get a lot of funny stuff.

142
0:10:56,340 --> 0:10:59,340
 And then there, of course, is that this is all the legit businesses.

143
0:10:59,340 --> 0:11:02,340
 Then there, of course, is all the spammers.

144
0:11:02,340 --> 0:11:06,340
 People who get your email list from somewhere.

145
0:11:06,340 --> 0:11:08,340
 And sign you to random list.

146
0:11:08,340 --> 0:11:11,340
 And there's also all the companies who believe that.

147
0:11:11,340 --> 0:11:15,340
 If you, I believe some of you are also running companies.

148
0:11:15,340 --> 0:11:22,340
 If you're not a private person but it's a company email, people believe they're actually allowed to send your email.

149
0:11:22,340 --> 0:11:26,340
 But the rules are exactly, at least in Denmark, they are exactly the same.

150
0:11:26,340 --> 0:11:28,340
 It's spam.

151
0:11:28,340 --> 0:11:36,340
 If you reach out to someone in any way electronical, whether that's like email, text, messenger, or whatever.

152
0:11:36,340 --> 0:11:43,340
 With the purpose of, maybe not in the first message, but down the road selling them something.

153
0:11:43,340 --> 0:11:47,340
 And they haven't beforehand agreed to this electronic communication.

154
0:11:47,340 --> 0:11:49,340
 It's spam.

155
0:11:49,340 --> 0:11:54,340
 So, there's the category of, oh, I didn't know the law, spammers.

156
0:11:54,340 --> 0:11:58,340
 And then there's all the, yes, we know, but we don't care, spammers.

157
0:11:58,340 --> 0:12:02,340
 So, there's a lot of way to get on these lists.

158
0:12:02,340 --> 0:12:05,340
 And we shouldn't just, of course, you can just say.

159
0:12:05,340 --> 0:12:07,340
 Well, I never sign up to any list.

160
0:12:07,340 --> 0:12:12,340
 Yeah, well, but then you might get, it might be a good bargain.

161
0:12:12,340 --> 0:12:18,340
 It might be value for email to sign up to some of these lists.

162
0:12:18,340 --> 0:12:22,340
 That could be, I hope that some of the people, most of the people who sign up to my lists.

163
0:12:22,340 --> 0:12:27,340
 That they're actually happy with what I'm providing even though I'm also trying to sell them things.

164
0:12:27,340 --> 0:12:34,340
 But there are other lists where, well, the bargain isn't really in your favor.

165
0:12:34,340 --> 0:12:37,340
 You signed up for something.

166
0:12:37,340 --> 0:12:39,340
 You get some crappy ebook.

167
0:12:39,340 --> 0:12:42,340
 And then you get a ton of marketing emails.

168
0:12:42,340 --> 0:12:45,340
 And maybe also from third parties.

169
0:12:45,340 --> 0:12:51,340
 So, every time we sign up to a list, look at it.

170
0:12:51,340 --> 0:12:55,340
 Who's making a win here?

171
0:12:55,340 --> 0:13:02,340
 So, I'm going to give you a look behind the scenes in MailChimp.

172
0:13:02,340 --> 0:13:03,340
 So, we can actually see what's going on.

173
0:13:04,340 --> 0:13:07,340
 And this is like, this is a free MailChimp.

174
0:13:07,340 --> 0:13:15,340
 What we're going to look into here is a free MailChimp account that I've set up many years ago.

175
0:13:15,340 --> 0:13:18,340
 But now I'm only using it for this test purpose.

176
0:13:18,340 --> 0:13:25,340
 And this MailChimp account, it's like this is what everybody who uses MailChimp has access to.

177
0:13:25,340 --> 0:13:32,340
 If I had a paid account, I could even pay MailChimp to give me even more information.

178
0:13:32,340 --> 0:13:36,340
 And to make more advanced analysis.

179
0:13:36,340 --> 0:13:39,340
 And one thing is what I can see.

180
0:13:39,340 --> 0:13:41,340
 Because I can see a lot.

181
0:13:41,340 --> 0:13:43,340
 MailChimp can see even more.

182
0:13:43,340 --> 0:13:52,340
 And MailChimp is known for actually collecting data across platforms or across accounts.

183
0:13:52,340 --> 0:13:58,340
 So, if I sign up with my email on one list in MailChimp and another list in MailChimp and a third list in MailChimp.

184
0:13:58,340 --> 0:14:01,340
 Then the people on the individual accounts.

185
0:14:01,340 --> 0:14:03,340
 They don't know I'm on other lists.

186
0:14:03,340 --> 0:14:05,340
 But MailChimp knows that.

187
0:14:05,340 --> 0:14:07,340
 And they're using that for profiling.

188
0:14:07,340 --> 0:14:15,340
 So, when I send a broadcast from MailChimp.

189
0:14:15,340 --> 0:14:17,340
 I of course get a report.

190
0:14:17,340 --> 0:14:19,340
 So, if we have like...

191
0:14:23,340 --> 0:14:25,340
 Here.

192
0:14:25,340 --> 0:14:27,340
 We just have to get out of here.

193
0:14:29,340 --> 0:14:31,340
 We have the campaigns.

194
0:14:31,340 --> 0:14:40,340
 And then I have sent a few emails here over the last couple of days.

195
0:14:40,340 --> 0:14:44,340
 So, I have an overview here of my campaigns.

196
0:14:44,340 --> 0:14:48,340
 I can see I sent these three born hack emails.

197
0:14:48,340 --> 0:14:51,340
 And on the first one.

198
0:14:51,340 --> 0:14:55,340
 I had a 50% open rate and a 25% click rate.

199
0:14:55,340 --> 0:15:00,340
 So, if I look into this one.

200
0:15:01,340 --> 0:15:03,340
 We can say view the report.

201
0:15:03,340 --> 0:15:05,340
 We want to know what happened here.

202
0:15:07,340 --> 0:15:09,340
 So, open rates.

203
0:15:12,340 --> 0:15:18,340
 They're tracked by loading a tiny pixel.

204
0:15:18,340 --> 0:15:20,340
 A tiny invisible image.

205
0:15:20,340 --> 0:15:23,340
 So, if you don't load images.

206
0:15:23,340 --> 0:15:26,340
 I would guess that in this audience.

207
0:15:26,340 --> 0:15:29,340
 There's an above average number of people.

208
0:15:29,340 --> 0:15:31,340
 Who in their email client.

209
0:15:31,340 --> 0:15:33,340
 Don't load images.

210
0:15:33,340 --> 0:15:36,340
 I always get notification from email list.

211
0:15:36,340 --> 0:15:40,340
 That hey, you haven't opened any of our emails in the last six months.

212
0:15:40,340 --> 0:15:41,340
 Do you still want to stay on the list?

213
0:15:41,340 --> 0:15:42,340
 And I'm like.

214
0:15:42,340 --> 0:15:45,340
 Yeah, I'm like reading every second one of your emails.

215
0:15:45,340 --> 0:15:47,340
 But I never load the images.

216
0:15:47,340 --> 0:15:49,340
 Because I don't want you to actually track me.

217
0:15:49,340 --> 0:15:57,340
 So, that is one of the ways that we prevent tracking.

218
0:15:57,340 --> 0:16:00,340
 So, when we have open rates here.

219
0:16:00,340 --> 0:16:06,340
 It's only those who actually loaded the images.

220
0:16:06,340 --> 0:16:08,340
 This is quite interesting.

221
0:16:08,340 --> 0:16:13,340
 So, I can see here information about my audience.

222
0:16:13,340 --> 0:16:18,340
 And that is like that we have like over 65% female from 25 and up.

223
0:16:18,340 --> 0:16:20,340
 And that's a bit funny.

224
0:16:20,340 --> 0:16:24,340
 Because this is like only signing up random email addresses.

225
0:16:24,340 --> 0:16:26,340
 That only exists right here.

226
0:16:26,340 --> 0:16:32,340
 But they're giving me this demographics info.

227
0:16:32,340 --> 0:16:34,340
 So, I can see here.

228
0:16:34,340 --> 0:16:41,340
 I have like an open rate of 50.

229
0:16:41,340 --> 0:16:48,340
 I can compare it to my average performance for these ones.

230
0:16:48,340 --> 0:16:50,340
 This is still fairly okay.

231
0:16:50,340 --> 0:16:52,340
 It's like I can see this.

232
0:16:52,340 --> 0:16:55,340
 And I don't know if it's Peter or Johanna or whoever.

233
0:16:55,340 --> 0:16:57,340
 Clicked and did what.

234
0:16:57,340 --> 0:17:01,340
 And it might be helpful or it might be useless to know this.

235
0:17:01,340 --> 0:17:07,340
 Some email marketers are like extremely concerned about open rates.

236
0:17:07,340 --> 0:17:11,340
 That's like the golden calf of email marketing.

237
0:17:11,340 --> 0:17:13,340
 That's to get people to open your emails.

238
0:17:13,340 --> 0:17:17,340
 And I'm a bit like, yeah, well, but what about all the people who doesn't load the images.

239
0:17:17,340 --> 0:17:19,340
 So, you don't know if they're opening or not.

240
0:17:19,340 --> 0:17:24,340
 And actually the important thing is in the end who ends up buying.

241
0:17:24,340 --> 0:17:26,340
 It's not who opens your emails.

242
0:17:26,340 --> 0:17:28,340
 It's who ends up buying from you.

243
0:17:28,340 --> 0:17:33,340
 So, I'm going to come back to that iOS 15 update.

244
0:17:33,340 --> 0:17:40,340
 But one of the things it's going to make harder is the open tracking.

245
0:17:40,340 --> 0:17:42,340
 And I'm not too concerned about that.

246
0:17:42,340 --> 0:17:44,340
 But I know a lot of people are.

247
0:17:44,340 --> 0:17:52,340
 So, we can also see here MailChimp is super interested in getting me to look at my open rates.

248
0:17:52,340 --> 0:17:55,340
 And improve my open rates.

249
0:17:55,340 --> 0:17:58,340
 And making me psyched about that.

250
0:17:58,340 --> 0:17:59,340
 But now I can see.

251
0:17:59,340 --> 0:18:02,340
 Now I come down to the detail description here.

252
0:18:02,340 --> 0:18:05,340
 I had like this mail was delivered to four people.

253
0:18:05,340 --> 0:18:09,340
 I can see I had two total opens.

254
0:18:09,340 --> 0:18:11,340
 I had one who clicked.

255
0:18:11,340 --> 0:18:14,340
 And I can see when they did it.

256
0:18:14,340 --> 0:18:19,340
 So, I can click here and say, oh, well, so the opens.

257
0:18:19,340 --> 0:18:21,340
 There was like two total opens.

258
0:18:21,340 --> 0:18:26,340
 Then I can go in and see, okay, so who opened this email?

259
0:18:26,340 --> 0:18:28,340
 I could also automate things.

260
0:18:28,340 --> 0:18:30,340
 I could put actions on.

261
0:18:30,340 --> 0:18:32,340
 I actually don't know MailChimp.

262
0:18:32,340 --> 0:18:35,340
 I think in MailChimp I can put actions on people who open my emails.

263
0:18:35,340 --> 0:18:49,340
 But I definitely can put actions like tagging people or sending them through an automated, another automated sequence or skipping emails based on how they handle the emails.

264
0:18:49,340 --> 0:18:50,340
 Do they open them?

265
0:18:50,340 --> 0:18:51,340
 Do they click?

266
0:18:51,340 --> 0:18:54,340
 So, I can do a lot of automated stuff.

267
0:18:54,340 --> 0:19:02,340
 But I can also just manually go in and see, okay, so this is the two people who opened my email.

268
0:19:02,340 --> 0:19:10,340
 And then I can actually click here on the name of this person or the email address of this person.

269
0:19:10,340 --> 0:19:14,340
 And then I can see, okay, so this is not so interesting.

270
0:19:14,340 --> 0:19:20,340
 It was opened August 11th at 2.52 p.m.

271
0:19:20,340 --> 0:19:27,340
 But I can still see this one person, this specific email address opened this email at this time.

272
0:19:27,340 --> 0:19:39,340
 Then if I click on the email address, then I come to the contact page of this one person in my MailChimp system.

273
0:19:39,340 --> 0:19:44,340
 So, I can see here when does this person actually opt in.

274
0:19:44,340 --> 0:19:49,340
 I can see what sign-up form they used.

275
0:19:50,340 --> 0:19:53,340
 I could write notes here.

276
0:19:53,340 --> 0:20:09,340
 Be aware this is not a place for person, what do you call that, whatever, sensitive information.

277
0:20:09,340 --> 0:20:12,340
 This is not a system to handle that.

278
0:20:12,340 --> 0:20:19,340
 That's also like one of the issues I have with some of these systems is that you have all the information.

279
0:20:19,340 --> 0:20:22,340
 That you have all this information available.

280
0:20:22,340 --> 0:20:25,340
 You have all these opportunities available.

281
0:20:25,340 --> 0:20:33,340
 And as I said, this is not just the only big companies with specific people handling this who knows their GDPR

282
0:20:33,340 --> 0:20:37,340
 and who knows their data security and who knows how to handle stuff

283
0:20:37,340 --> 0:20:41,340
 and who knows that two-factor authentication is a good thing and stuff like that.

284
0:20:41,340 --> 0:20:47,340
 This is also your average hairdresser, yoga instructor,

285
0:20:49,340 --> 0:20:54,340
 restaurant owner, everybody can sign up for a MailChimp account.

286
0:20:54,340 --> 0:20:57,340
 In MailChimp, you don't even need your own email domain.

287
0:20:57,340 --> 0:21:01,340
 You can actually send from your Gmail address or whatever

288
0:21:01,340 --> 0:21:08,340
 and it will still have a reasonable deliverability rate due to some of the MailChimp setup.

289
0:21:08,340 --> 0:21:13,340
 So, everybody can get access to this.

290
0:21:13,340 --> 0:21:16,340
 And since the opportunity here for...

291
0:21:16,340 --> 0:21:18,340
 There's the option here to write notes on contact.

292
0:21:18,340 --> 0:21:25,340
 That means that someone will use this note function for sensitive information

293
0:21:25,340 --> 0:21:28,340
 because it's like here, oh, I have a physiotherapy clinic.

294
0:21:28,340 --> 0:21:30,340
 I can use this for my journaling.

295
0:21:30,340 --> 0:21:33,340
 Professional physiotherapists probably won't do that.

296
0:21:33,340 --> 0:21:40,340
 But if you just went to some coaching seminar or massage course or something like that,

297
0:21:40,340 --> 0:21:42,340
 you might not actually know the rules.

298
0:21:42,340 --> 0:21:47,340
 And then you just say, oh, well, but this can handle both my journaling and my emails.

299
0:21:48,340 --> 0:21:50,340
 Don't go there.

300
0:21:50,340 --> 0:21:55,340
 But that also means we need to be careful about what information we are giving to people

301
0:21:55,340 --> 0:21:58,340
 whose email list we are signing up to.

302
0:21:58,340 --> 0:22:01,340
 If you get like, when you sign up to an email list,

303
0:22:01,340 --> 0:22:06,340
 the minimum you need to provide is your email address.

304
0:22:06,340 --> 0:22:11,340
 There's like no maximum amount of data people can ask you to provide on sign up.

305
0:22:11,340 --> 0:22:14,340
 It's like, yeah, well, okay, I give my name and my email.

306
0:22:14,340 --> 0:22:16,340
 Okay, that's relatively fair.

307
0:22:18,340 --> 0:22:20,340
 Maybe they want my full name.

308
0:22:20,340 --> 0:22:24,340
 They want my home address.

309
0:22:24,340 --> 0:22:26,340
 They want my phone number.

310
0:22:26,340 --> 0:22:28,340
 They want my birth date.

311
0:22:28,340 --> 0:22:31,340
 They want to know how many kids I have.

312
0:22:31,340 --> 0:22:35,340
 They want to know the color of my eyes, my shoe size, my height, whatever.

313
0:22:35,340 --> 0:22:42,340
 There's a lot of profiling going on, and we need to be aware when we sign up

314
0:22:42,340 --> 0:22:44,340
 what information we're actually giving.

315
0:22:44,340 --> 0:22:45,340
 Yes, I can just lie.

316
0:22:45,340 --> 0:22:46,340
 I know that.

317
0:22:46,340 --> 0:22:47,340
 But if you ask me, I know that.

318
0:22:47,340 --> 0:22:52,340
 If you ask those questions, a lot of people will truthfully answer them.

319
0:22:52,340 --> 0:22:54,340
 Not you guys, I presume.

320
0:22:54,340 --> 0:23:00,340
 But a lot of average Joes will answer those questions honestly,

321
0:23:00,340 --> 0:23:03,340
 and then their information, their real information,

322
0:23:03,340 --> 0:23:06,340
 will be inside systems like MailChimp and the other ones.

323
0:23:06,340 --> 0:23:12,340
 So if you're an email marketer, don't ask for anything you don't need.

324
0:23:12,340 --> 0:23:16,340
 Don't use a, oh, it would be nice to know

325
0:23:17,340 --> 0:23:20,340
 if they're living, or it would be nice to know if they have kids,

326
0:23:20,340 --> 0:23:23,340
 or it would be nice to know whatever, if they're occupied,

327
0:23:23,340 --> 0:23:26,340
 or how much money they earn, or anything.

328
0:23:26,340 --> 0:23:28,340
 Ask what you need.

329
0:23:28,340 --> 0:23:30,340
 Don't ask any more than that.

330
0:23:30,340 --> 0:23:35,340
 So that was me taking off on a note here.

331
0:23:35,340 --> 0:23:40,340
 So I can see that this contact has, from the mails she's been sent,

332
0:23:40,340 --> 0:23:44,340
 a 50% open rate, hasn't clicked anything.

333
0:23:44,340 --> 0:23:46,340
 I can hook up MailChimp.

334
0:23:46,340 --> 0:23:50,340
 With whatever shop system I use,

335
0:23:50,340 --> 0:23:52,340
 and then I can also track my orders,

336
0:23:52,340 --> 0:23:54,340
 so I would also be able to see,

337
0:23:54,340 --> 0:23:57,340
 is this person actually the one who's buying stuff,

338
0:23:57,340 --> 0:23:59,340
 and making money for me,

339
0:23:59,340 --> 0:24:05,340
 or is this one just someone who's freeloading.

340
0:24:05,340 --> 0:24:09,340
 I've got some profile information.

341
0:24:09,340 --> 0:24:12,340
 I've got some GDPR info.

342
0:24:12,340 --> 0:24:15,340
 I know something about the link.

343
0:24:15,340 --> 0:24:19,340
 The language the person is speaking.

344
0:24:19,340 --> 0:24:23,340
 I know something about the location.

345
0:24:23,340 --> 0:24:26,340
 That's based on the sign-up IP.

346
0:24:26,340 --> 0:24:29,340
 I know the favorite email client.

347
0:24:29,340 --> 0:24:32,340
 This actually says a lot about people.

348
0:24:32,340 --> 0:24:35,340
 So my favorite email client for this customer,

349
0:24:35,340 --> 0:24:39,340
 for this test person, is Thunderbird.

350
0:24:39,340 --> 0:24:42,340
 You can also use this for profiling.

351
0:24:42,340 --> 0:24:45,340
 Because, hey, if you have this small amount of your people,

352
0:24:45,340 --> 0:24:47,340
 who actually use Outlook,

353
0:24:47,340 --> 0:24:49,340
 you can do something specific for them.

354
0:24:49,340 --> 0:24:53,340
 There's a lot of information

355
0:24:53,340 --> 0:24:56,340
 in what email client people are using,

356
0:24:56,340 --> 0:24:59,340
 that says something about who they are,

357
0:24:59,340 --> 0:25:01,340
 and the kind of way they're working.

358
0:25:01,340 --> 0:25:06,340
 If this was some mail client for Android or something,

359
0:25:06,340 --> 0:25:07,340
 that would say, hey, okay,

360
0:25:07,340 --> 0:25:10,340
 she's usually reading emails from her phone.

361
0:25:10,340 --> 0:25:13,340
 That's valuable information.

362
0:25:15,340 --> 0:25:19,340
 And again, Mailchimp, behind the scenes,

363
0:25:19,340 --> 0:25:22,340
 can see a lot more than this.

364
0:25:22,340 --> 0:25:24,340
 They can see what Thunderbird version I'm running

365
0:25:24,340 --> 0:25:27,340
 and stuff like that.

366
0:25:27,340 --> 0:25:30,340
 So then we have the activity feed.

367
0:25:30,340 --> 0:25:36,340
 And this is where I think this is like the most important

368
0:25:36,340 --> 0:25:39,340
 not free part.

369
0:25:39,340 --> 0:25:44,340
 Because I don't know in Mailchimp how long this activity feed

370
0:25:44,340 --> 0:25:46,340
 goes back.

371
0:25:46,340 --> 0:25:51,340
 In most system, you can see at least six months back.

372
0:25:51,340 --> 0:25:54,340
 So I can see here, I opted into emails.

373
0:25:54,340 --> 0:25:57,340
 Then I was sent the first email.

374
0:25:57,340 --> 0:25:58,340
 I opened that one.

375
0:25:58,340 --> 0:25:59,340
 I was sent the second one.

376
0:25:59,340 --> 0:26:00,340
 I didn't open that.

377
0:26:00,340 --> 0:26:03,340
 But this here will have all my history of my clicks

378
0:26:03,340 --> 0:26:10,340
 and my opens in my Mailchimp, on this Mailchimp account.

379
0:26:10,340 --> 0:26:14,340
 So you can imagine, if you sign up,

380
0:26:14,340 --> 0:26:19,340
 for a list and stays there for a long while,

381
0:26:19,340 --> 0:26:22,340
 this information will be quite extensive.

382
0:26:22,340 --> 0:26:24,340
 People can see, okay, what are people actually doing?

383
0:26:24,340 --> 0:26:29,340
 And if I get someone on my list who I would,

384
0:26:29,340 --> 0:26:33,340
 if you sign up with your real name and your real email,

385
0:26:33,340 --> 0:26:35,340
 and I like to know, oh, that was interesting.

386
0:26:35,340 --> 0:26:37,340
 He signed up to my list.

387
0:26:37,340 --> 0:26:40,340
 I'm wondering, how is he behaving in this system?

388
0:26:40,340 --> 0:26:42,340
 I actually have an awful lot of data,

389
0:26:42,340 --> 0:26:44,340
 because this is all being kept track of.

390
0:26:44,340 --> 0:26:49,340
 It's not just that I can go in and see on the specific email

391
0:26:49,340 --> 0:26:52,340
 who opened it and maybe do it like that.

392
0:26:52,340 --> 0:26:56,340
 I can actually go into one specific person in my email system

393
0:26:56,340 --> 0:27:01,340
 and follow how they are behaving.

394
0:27:01,340 --> 0:27:09,340
 I could, if I wanted, I could put tags on this or automate things.

395
0:27:09,340 --> 0:27:11,340
 So if people behave in a specific way,

396
0:27:11,340 --> 0:27:13,340
 we send them to another email sequence,

397
0:27:13,340 --> 0:27:16,340
 because then I know, hey, if they click that link

398
0:27:16,340 --> 0:27:18,340
 and they haven't purchased anything yet,

399
0:27:18,340 --> 0:27:20,340
 so they're probably interested,

400
0:27:20,340 --> 0:27:22,340
 but they haven't reached a decision yet.

401
0:27:22,340 --> 0:27:24,340
 I need to send them a few more emails.

402
0:27:24,340 --> 0:27:28,340
 So in one way, that's like good business sense,

403
0:27:28,340 --> 0:27:32,340
 because I say, okay, I don't want to nag those people

404
0:27:32,340 --> 0:27:34,340
 who didn't click any of the links in this campaign.

405
0:27:34,340 --> 0:27:37,340
 I don't want to nag them with too many more emails.

406
0:27:37,340 --> 0:27:40,340
 But those people who are like on the verge,

407
0:27:40,340 --> 0:27:43,340
 and they might be convinced to purchase

408
0:27:43,340 --> 0:27:45,340
 if I send them a few more emails,

409
0:27:45,340 --> 0:27:47,340
 I would like to send them some more emails,

410
0:27:47,340 --> 0:27:49,340
 because those who hasn't clicked this campaign,

411
0:27:49,340 --> 0:27:51,340
 maybe they'd be interested in the next,

412
0:27:51,340 --> 0:27:55,340
 and I don't want them to actually just go and unsubscribe.

413
0:27:55,340 --> 0:27:58,340
 So as an email marketer, I have to be a bit like,

414
0:27:58,340 --> 0:28:02,340
 yeah, okay, so I would like to use this information,

415
0:28:02,340 --> 0:28:05,340
 because it's actually valuable information,

416
0:28:05,340 --> 0:28:08,340
 and I can use it to customize my campaign.

417
0:28:08,340 --> 0:28:10,340
 I can say, okay, so people who don't click this,

418
0:28:10,340 --> 0:28:12,340
 and people who click that,

419
0:28:12,340 --> 0:28:16,340
 we send them to a special email sequence

420
0:28:16,340 --> 0:28:19,340
 instead of those who didn't click anything,

421
0:28:19,340 --> 0:28:21,340
 they just get a few more emails,

422
0:28:21,340 --> 0:28:24,340
 and then we quiet it down a bit.

423
0:28:24,340 --> 0:28:26,340
 And this can be automated,

424
0:28:26,340 --> 0:28:28,340
 it can be like an onboarding sequence

425
0:28:28,340 --> 0:28:29,340
 where you automate it,

426
0:28:29,340 --> 0:28:31,340
 or it can be a specific campaign

427
0:28:31,340 --> 0:28:34,340
 for a specific here and now purchase.

428
0:28:34,340 --> 0:28:36,340
 But there's a lot of opportunities,

429
0:28:36,340 --> 0:28:38,340
 and I get all these data,

430
0:28:38,340 --> 0:28:39,340
 and it's just the same,

431
0:28:39,340 --> 0:28:43,340
 as with when we've been discussing things

432
0:28:43,340 --> 0:28:47,340
 about how people, Russians or whoever,

433
0:28:47,340 --> 0:28:52,340
 are going to affect elections and stuff like that.

434
0:28:52,340 --> 0:28:54,340
 We know people are susceptible

435
0:28:54,340 --> 0:28:59,340
 to various kinds of nudging and information,

436
0:28:59,340 --> 0:29:02,340
 and if I keep hitting the right people

437
0:29:02,340 --> 0:29:03,340
 with the right information,

438
0:29:03,340 --> 0:29:05,340
 I might actually be able to convince someone

439
0:29:05,340 --> 0:29:08,340
 to purchase something that they might not have purchased

440
0:29:08,340 --> 0:29:10,340
 had I just sent them like two emails.

441
0:29:10,340 --> 0:29:13,340
 But now I send them this specific email

442
0:29:13,340 --> 0:29:15,340
 based on some specific behavior,

443
0:29:15,340 --> 0:29:17,340
 and then I can convince them to purchase.

444
0:29:17,340 --> 0:29:19,340
 And there are some people out there,

445
0:29:19,340 --> 0:29:21,340
 some companies that really specialize

446
0:29:21,340 --> 0:29:24,340
 in analyzing this and setting up campaigns

447
0:29:24,340 --> 0:29:27,340
 based on all this behavior tracking,

448
0:29:27,340 --> 0:29:32,340
 and I think basically it's not overly ethical,

449
0:29:32,340 --> 0:29:34,340
 and it's a bit scaring that people

450
0:29:34,340 --> 0:29:36,340
 can actually see all this about us.

451
0:29:36,340 --> 0:29:37,340
 So,

452
0:29:38,340 --> 0:29:43,340
 we have,

453
0:29:43,340 --> 0:29:45,340
 as an average MailChimp user,

454
0:29:45,340 --> 0:29:47,340
 which I'm not because I'm not on a daily basis

455
0:29:47,340 --> 0:29:49,340
 using MailChimp,

456
0:29:49,340 --> 0:29:50,340
 but a lot of people are,

457
0:29:50,340 --> 0:29:52,340
 and that's like the go-to tool

458
0:29:52,340 --> 0:29:53,340
 because you can use it for free

459
0:29:53,340 --> 0:29:55,340
 for up to a thousand subscribers,

460
0:29:55,340 --> 0:29:58,340
 so a lot of people are using MailChimp,

461
0:29:58,340 --> 0:30:02,340
 and it has all this data available for free.

462
0:30:02,340 --> 0:30:04,340
 So,

463
0:30:04,340 --> 0:30:05,340
 if I have,

464
0:30:05,340 --> 0:30:07,340
 as a person who signed up to an email,

465
0:30:07,340 --> 0:30:09,340
 who signed up to an email list,

466
0:30:09,340 --> 0:30:10,340
 if I need to ask myself,

467
0:30:10,340 --> 0:30:12,340
 okay, if it doesn't cost any money,

468
0:30:12,340 --> 0:30:14,340
 what am I paying with?

469
0:30:14,340 --> 0:30:17,340
 Then when I sign up for a free MailChimp account,

470
0:30:17,340 --> 0:30:19,340
 I have to ask myself,

471
0:30:19,340 --> 0:30:22,340
 what am I and my subscribers paying with?

472
0:30:22,340 --> 0:30:25,340
 And we are definitely paying with more emails,

473
0:30:25,340 --> 0:30:30,340
 more information fed into the MailChimp system.

474
0:30:30,340 --> 0:30:31,340
 So,

475
0:30:31,340 --> 0:30:32,340
 so it's not free for me,

476
0:30:32,340 --> 0:30:36,340
 it's not free for my subscribers.

477
0:30:36,340 --> 0:30:39,340
 MailChimp actually has a feature

478
0:30:39,340 --> 0:30:42,340
 where you can set up your emails to be sent,

479
0:30:42,340 --> 0:30:45,340
 then they analyze the email addresses,

480
0:30:45,340 --> 0:30:46,340
 and they say,

481
0:30:46,340 --> 0:30:48,340
 okay, so I would usually send this email

482
0:30:48,340 --> 0:30:50,340
 at 2 p.m. in the afternoon.

483
0:30:50,340 --> 0:30:52,340
 They would go and look at my list and say,

484
0:30:52,340 --> 0:30:53,340
 okay, what is the,

485
0:30:53,340 --> 0:30:54,340
 for each person on my list,

486
0:30:54,340 --> 0:30:58,340
 what is the best time to send these emails?

487
0:30:58,340 --> 0:31:00,340
 And no, they're not just basing that

488
0:31:00,340 --> 0:31:03,340
 on my one monthly newsletter,

489
0:31:03,340 --> 0:31:05,340
 they are definitely basing that

490
0:31:05,340 --> 0:31:07,340
 on all the info they have

491
0:31:07,340 --> 0:31:11,340
 on that specific email address in the system.

492
0:31:11,340 --> 0:31:13,340
 But that's a paid feature.

493
0:31:13,340 --> 0:31:14,340
 Yeah.

494
0:31:14,340 --> 0:31:17,340
 So,

495
0:31:17,340 --> 0:31:19,340
 I so didn't want to do that.

496
0:31:24,340 --> 0:31:27,340
 We just go back to opening this one.

497
0:31:27,340 --> 0:31:29,340
 There it goes.

498
0:31:35,340 --> 0:31:37,340
 Yeah.

499
0:31:37,340 --> 0:31:39,340
 So, that was MailChimp,

500
0:31:39,340 --> 0:31:42,340
 and MailChimp is basically no worse

501
0:31:42,340 --> 0:31:46,340
 or no better than the rest of the systems out there.

502
0:31:46,340 --> 0:31:48,340
 They just have a free option,

503
0:31:48,340 --> 0:31:51,340
 so that's why I picked on them.

504
0:31:51,340 --> 0:31:53,340
 So,

505
0:31:53,340 --> 0:31:55,340
 what can you do as a user

506
0:31:55,340 --> 0:31:59,340
 who would like to subscribe to email lists

507
0:31:59,340 --> 0:32:03,340
 and don't get overly profiled and tracked?

508
0:32:03,340 --> 0:32:04,340
 Well, first of all,

509
0:32:04,340 --> 0:32:09,340
 don't just sign up for everything.

510
0:32:09,340 --> 0:32:11,340
 Think before you sign up.

511
0:32:11,340 --> 0:32:14,340
 Consider, is this actually worth it?

512
0:32:14,340 --> 0:32:15,340
 Do I think,

513
0:32:15,340 --> 0:32:17,340
 will I get something of value

514
0:32:17,340 --> 0:32:19,340
 from giving my name and my email address?

515
0:32:19,340 --> 0:32:21,340
 If it's one of those places

516
0:32:21,340 --> 0:32:23,340
 where you also need to give your phone number

517
0:32:23,340 --> 0:32:25,340
 and 10 other things,

518
0:32:25,340 --> 0:32:26,340
 well,

519
0:32:26,340 --> 0:32:28,340
 it really needs to be something really,

520
0:32:28,340 --> 0:32:31,340
 really good to be worth it.

521
0:32:31,340 --> 0:32:33,340
 User-specific,

522
0:32:33,340 --> 0:32:34,340
 or random,

523
0:32:34,340 --> 0:32:37,340
 emails for lists.

524
0:32:37,340 --> 0:32:40,340
 If you want to be profiled slightly less,

525
0:32:40,340 --> 0:32:42,340
 don't use your main email

526
0:32:42,340 --> 0:32:46,340
 for signing up to all those crappy email lists

527
0:32:46,340 --> 0:32:47,340
 or all the good ones.

528
0:32:47,340 --> 0:32:49,340
 Or have like several,

529
0:32:49,340 --> 0:32:51,340
 this is like my favorite email

530
0:32:51,340 --> 0:32:53,340
 for important lists.

531
0:32:53,340 --> 0:32:54,340
 There might be some lists

532
0:32:54,340 --> 0:32:56,340
 that actually provide real value

533
0:32:56,340 --> 0:32:59,340
 where you want to keep up.

534
0:32:59,340 --> 0:33:02,340
 This is an email for less important lists,

535
0:33:02,340 --> 0:33:04,340
 and this is the email address

536
0:33:04,340 --> 0:33:07,340
 I use for everything

537
0:33:07,340 --> 0:33:09,340
 where it doesn't matter.

538
0:33:09,340 --> 0:33:10,340
 I don't really,

539
0:33:10,340 --> 0:33:12,340
 maybe it's just you set up a rule,

540
0:33:12,340 --> 0:33:13,340
 it goes directly into spam,

541
0:33:13,340 --> 0:33:17,340
 whatever is sent to that email.

542
0:33:17,340 --> 0:33:18,340
 Then,

543
0:33:18,340 --> 0:33:20,340
 don't load images.

544
0:33:20,340 --> 0:33:23,340
 If you set your email client

545
0:33:23,340 --> 0:33:25,340
 as default to not load images

546
0:33:25,340 --> 0:33:28,340
 unless you ask it to,

547
0:33:28,340 --> 0:33:30,340
 the email marketers

548
0:33:30,340 --> 0:33:32,340
 will have a lot of hard time

549
0:33:32,340 --> 0:33:33,340
 tracking you

550
0:33:33,340 --> 0:33:35,340
 because then they can't,

551
0:33:35,340 --> 0:33:37,340
 you won't load their pixels

552
0:33:37,340 --> 0:33:38,340
 and they can't see you

553
0:33:38,340 --> 0:33:40,340
 actually open the email.

554
0:33:40,340 --> 0:33:42,340
 That will also make you think

555
0:33:42,340 --> 0:33:43,340
 because it's like,

556
0:33:43,340 --> 0:33:45,340
 I'm pretty amazed

557
0:33:45,340 --> 0:33:47,340
 when I get lots of emails,

558
0:33:47,340 --> 0:33:49,340
 I have like this big empty box,

559
0:33:49,340 --> 0:33:50,340
 and then the next empty box,

560
0:33:50,340 --> 0:33:52,340
 and then there's like one line of text,

561
0:33:52,340 --> 0:33:53,340
 and then there's like two more

562
0:33:53,340 --> 0:33:54,340
 big empty boxes.

563
0:33:54,340 --> 0:33:55,340
 And that's especially

564
0:33:55,340 --> 0:33:57,340
 with the MailChimp emails

565
0:33:57,340 --> 0:33:59,340
 really are not designed for people

566
0:33:59,340 --> 0:34:01,340
 who don't load images.

567
0:34:01,340 --> 0:34:04,340
 So you can really see,

568
0:34:04,340 --> 0:34:07,340
 okay, people are really trying to,

569
0:34:07,340 --> 0:34:11,340
 only trying to send this to people

570
0:34:11,340 --> 0:34:13,340
 who actually load the images.

571
0:34:13,340 --> 0:34:15,340
 A lot of email marketers

572
0:34:15,340 --> 0:34:17,340
 don't even think about the fact

573
0:34:17,340 --> 0:34:20,340
 that some of their readers

574
0:34:20,340 --> 0:34:22,340
 don't load the images.

575
0:34:22,340 --> 0:34:24,340
 So I always say to my clients that,

576
0:34:24,340 --> 0:34:25,340
 hey, when you send emails,

577
0:34:25,340 --> 0:34:28,340
 make sure it can actually be read

578
0:34:28,340 --> 0:34:30,340
 without loading the images.

579
0:34:30,340 --> 0:34:32,340
 Yes, I know you want people

580
0:34:32,340 --> 0:34:33,340
 to load the images

581
0:34:33,340 --> 0:34:35,340
 so you can track the open rates.

582
0:34:35,340 --> 0:34:37,340
 I would much prefer to actually

583
0:34:37,340 --> 0:34:39,340
 just have people be able

584
0:34:39,340 --> 0:34:43,340
 to read my emails.

585
0:34:43,340 --> 0:34:45,340
 If they want to load the images,

586
0:34:45,340 --> 0:34:46,340
 that's awesome.

587
0:34:46,340 --> 0:34:48,340
 If they don't want to load them,

588
0:34:48,340 --> 0:34:52,340
 well, the point should still be

589
0:34:52,340 --> 0:34:54,340
 understandable.

590
0:34:54,340 --> 0:34:57,340
 Make sure to use alt tags

591
0:34:57,340 --> 0:34:58,340
 for your images

592
0:34:58,340 --> 0:35:00,340
 if you have like an employee

593
0:35:00,340 --> 0:35:01,340
 who has an important video

594
0:35:01,340 --> 0:35:02,340
 they need to click

595
0:35:02,340 --> 0:35:03,340
 or something like that.

596
0:35:03,340 --> 0:35:04,340
 Put in that this is actually

597
0:35:04,340 --> 0:35:08,340
 a video, go click it.

598
0:35:08,340 --> 0:35:10,340
 So we can protect ourselves

599
0:35:10,340 --> 0:35:16,340
 by not loading all them images.

600
0:35:16,340 --> 0:35:18,340
 So a few words

601
0:35:18,340 --> 0:35:24,340
 about the iOS 15 updates.

602
0:35:24,340 --> 0:35:25,340
 None of us,

603
0:35:25,340 --> 0:35:26,340
 I've tried reading up a bit

604
0:35:26,340 --> 0:35:27,340
 because it was like

605
0:35:27,340 --> 0:35:28,340
 it was announced.

606
0:35:28,340 --> 0:35:30,340
 I think it's a couple of months

607
0:35:30,340 --> 0:35:33,340
 back now that with the iOS 14

608
0:35:33,340 --> 0:35:36,340
 something update,

609
0:35:36,340 --> 0:35:40,340
 Apple tried to restrict

610
0:35:40,340 --> 0:35:43,340
 cookie tracking,

611
0:35:43,340 --> 0:35:45,340
 which is right now giving people

612
0:35:45,340 --> 0:35:47,340
 a really, really hard time

613
0:35:47,340 --> 0:35:49,340
 with their Facebook ads.

614
0:35:49,340 --> 0:35:51,340
 I love that update.

615
0:35:51,340 --> 0:35:53,340
 But now they have announced

616
0:35:53,340 --> 0:35:55,340
 with iOS 15 that they're going

617
0:35:55,340 --> 0:35:57,340
 to make some privacy updates

618
0:35:57,340 --> 0:35:59,340
 to email reading.

619
0:35:59,340 --> 0:36:00,340
 And you can,

620
0:36:00,340 --> 0:36:03,340
 I don't really like

621
0:36:03,340 --> 0:36:06,340
 Apple's privacy thoughts,

622
0:36:06,340 --> 0:36:07,340
 but this here,

623
0:36:07,340 --> 0:36:09,340
 I like the idea about

624
0:36:09,340 --> 0:36:10,340
 behind this one

625
0:36:10,340 --> 0:36:11,340
 and then there with the other hand

626
0:36:11,340 --> 0:36:13,340
 they're doing really weird tracking stuff

627
0:36:13,340 --> 0:36:15,340
 of their own customers,

628
0:36:15,340 --> 0:36:16,340
 but then it's them doing the tracking,

629
0:36:16,340 --> 0:36:18,340
 so that's apparently okay.

630
0:36:18,340 --> 0:36:20,340
 But this here is that

631
0:36:20,340 --> 0:36:21,340
 they're going to,

632
0:36:21,340 --> 0:36:25,340
 when they fetch,

633
0:36:25,340 --> 0:36:26,340
 when an email is sent

634
0:36:26,340 --> 0:36:28,340
 to an iOS user,

635
0:36:28,340 --> 0:36:31,340
 the images in that email

636
0:36:31,340 --> 0:36:34,340
 will be loaded at a random time

637
0:36:34,340 --> 0:36:35,340
 and it will be loaded

638
0:36:35,340 --> 0:36:38,340
 by their server somewhere

639
0:36:38,340 --> 0:36:41,340
 and then rerouted

640
0:36:41,340 --> 0:36:43,340
 to the recipient.

641
0:36:43,340 --> 0:36:44,340
 So that will mean that

642
0:36:44,340 --> 0:36:47,340
 as I read it,

643
0:36:47,340 --> 0:36:49,340
 it will mean that people

644
0:36:49,340 --> 0:36:51,340
 not opening the mails

645
0:36:51,340 --> 0:36:53,340
 will actually possibly be counted

646
0:36:53,340 --> 0:36:56,340
 as opens because the images

647
0:36:56,340 --> 0:36:58,340
 are being loaded by Apple.

648
0:36:58,340 --> 0:36:59,340
 On some server

649
0:36:59,340 --> 0:37:01,340
 and then the recipient

650
0:37:01,340 --> 0:37:02,340
 might or might not

651
0:37:02,340 --> 0:37:04,340
 collect those images.

652
0:37:04,340 --> 0:37:07,340
 That means since a lot of people,

653
0:37:07,340 --> 0:37:10,340
 and this is not a default feature,

654
0:37:10,340 --> 0:37:11,340
 it's something you will be able

655
0:37:11,340 --> 0:37:13,340
 to turn on,

656
0:37:13,340 --> 0:37:15,340
 but it will mean that

657
0:37:15,340 --> 0:37:18,340
 when iOS 15 is rolled out,

658
0:37:18,340 --> 0:37:21,340
 open tracking will be

659
0:37:21,340 --> 0:37:22,340
 a lot less reliable

660
0:37:22,340 --> 0:37:23,340
 and we definitely,

661
0:37:23,340 --> 0:37:24,340
 in those systems

662
0:37:24,340 --> 0:37:25,340
 where you have like

663
0:37:25,340 --> 0:37:27,340
 automatic tagging

664
0:37:27,340 --> 0:37:31,340
 or action based on opens,

665
0:37:31,340 --> 0:37:35,340
 that will be,

666
0:37:35,340 --> 0:37:37,340
 yeah, you can't really rely

667
0:37:37,340 --> 0:37:39,340
 on that anymore.

668
0:37:39,340 --> 0:37:41,340
 And they will also cloak

669
0:37:41,340 --> 0:37:43,340
 the recipient IP,

670
0:37:43,340 --> 0:37:45,340
 which I think is nice.

671
0:37:45,340 --> 0:37:46,340
 Then they also have this

672
0:37:46,340 --> 0:37:47,340
 kind of cool feature

673
0:37:47,340 --> 0:37:49,340
 where you can get

674
0:37:49,340 --> 0:37:53,340
 a random Apple email

675
0:37:53,340 --> 0:37:54,340
 that you just,

676
0:37:54,340 --> 0:37:55,340
 for one time,

677
0:37:55,340 --> 0:37:57,340
 sign up to a list

678
0:37:57,340 --> 0:37:59,340
 with this crappy

679
0:37:59,340 --> 0:38:00,340
 at apple.com

680
0:38:00,340 --> 0:38:02,340
 or whatever email address

681
0:38:02,340 --> 0:38:04,340
 and then in the system,

682
0:38:04,340 --> 0:38:05,340
 Apple knows that

683
0:38:05,340 --> 0:38:06,340
 this belongs to you,

684
0:38:06,340 --> 0:38:08,340
 but MailChimp doesn't know

685
0:38:08,340 --> 0:38:12,340
 what email Apple is redirecting it to.

686
0:38:12,340 --> 0:38:14,340
 So that is also kind of nice

687
0:38:14,340 --> 0:38:15,340
 to be able to sign up

688
0:38:15,340 --> 0:38:17,340
 to things without

689
0:38:17,340 --> 0:38:20,340
 giving your own email address.

690
0:38:20,340 --> 0:38:22,340
 The thing that should still be trackable

691
0:38:22,340 --> 0:38:23,340
 is the clicks

692
0:38:23,340 --> 0:38:24,340
 because when you click a link

693
0:38:24,340 --> 0:38:25,340
 in an email

694
0:38:25,340 --> 0:38:26,340
 in a marketing site,

695
0:38:26,340 --> 0:38:29,340
 in a marketing email,

696
0:38:29,340 --> 0:38:31,340
 usually,

697
0:38:31,340 --> 0:38:33,340
 that links takes you through,

698
0:38:33,340 --> 0:38:34,340
 like it's,

699
0:38:34,340 --> 0:38:35,340
 if you put the mouse over,

700
0:38:35,340 --> 0:38:36,340
 then you can see,

701
0:38:36,340 --> 0:38:38,340
 well, this is not like

702
0:38:38,340 --> 0:38:41,340
 I put in .bornhack.dk,

703
0:38:41,340 --> 0:38:43,340
 but the link would actually be

704
0:38:43,340 --> 0:38:44,340
 something, something,

705
0:38:44,340 --> 0:38:46,340
 MailChimp, something, something,

706
0:38:46,340 --> 0:38:47,340
 because they're taking it

707
0:38:47,340 --> 0:38:49,340
 through their server,

708
0:38:49,340 --> 0:38:51,340
 redirecting you to the page,

709
0:38:51,340 --> 0:38:52,340
 and then they can see,

710
0:38:52,340 --> 0:38:53,340
 okay, they can track

711
0:38:53,340 --> 0:38:54,340
 the links that way.

712
0:38:54,340 --> 0:38:55,340
 That should still be working

713
0:38:55,340 --> 0:38:56,340
 because you will actually

714
0:38:56,340 --> 0:38:58,340
 have to click the links.

715
0:38:58,340 --> 0:39:01,340
 So we'll see.

716
0:39:01,340 --> 0:39:02,340
 Only time will show

717
0:39:02,340 --> 0:39:03,340
 what this is actually going to mean

718
0:39:03,340 --> 0:39:06,340
 in real life.

719
0:39:06,340 --> 0:39:08,340
 Yeah, questions?

720
0:39:23,340 --> 0:39:24,340
 Thank you.

721
0:39:24,340 --> 0:39:26,340
 So the click rate,

722
0:39:26,340 --> 0:39:27,340
 you say,

723
0:39:27,340 --> 0:39:28,340
 so you can have opens

724
0:39:28,340 --> 0:39:30,340
 or you can have mails

725
0:39:30,340 --> 0:39:31,340
 that do not get opened

726
0:39:31,340 --> 0:39:32,340
 because we don't track

727
0:39:32,340 --> 0:39:34,340
 or they have disenabled

728
0:39:34,340 --> 0:39:35,340
 that feature,

729
0:39:35,340 --> 0:39:36,340
 but you can see

730
0:39:36,340 --> 0:39:38,340
 if they click something.

731
0:39:38,340 --> 0:39:39,340
 So the click thing

732
0:39:39,340 --> 0:39:40,340
 is the important thing here,

733
0:39:40,340 --> 0:39:41,340
 I think.

734
0:39:41,340 --> 0:39:42,340
 Yeah, exactly.

735
0:39:42,340 --> 0:39:43,340
 We will see,

736
0:39:43,340 --> 0:39:44,340
 as an email marketer,

737
0:39:44,340 --> 0:39:45,340
 I will have to move

738
0:39:45,340 --> 0:39:48,340
 from monitoring opens

739
0:39:48,340 --> 0:39:49,340
 to monitoring clicks

740
0:39:49,340 --> 0:39:50,340
 and then actually

741
0:39:50,340 --> 0:39:52,340
 maybe reframe

742
0:39:52,340 --> 0:39:53,340
 some of my way

743
0:39:53,340 --> 0:39:54,340
 of writing,

744
0:39:54,340 --> 0:39:55,340
 so I'm writing emails

745
0:39:55,340 --> 0:39:56,340
 so I,

746
0:39:56,340 --> 0:39:57,340
 in a much higher percentage

747
0:39:57,340 --> 0:39:58,340
 of my emails,

748
0:39:58,340 --> 0:39:59,340
 have something

749
0:39:59,340 --> 0:40:00,340
 that people,

750
0:40:00,340 --> 0:40:01,340
 like,

751
0:40:01,340 --> 0:40:02,340
 have a read more link.

752
0:40:02,340 --> 0:40:04,340
 Maybe I'm not actually writing

753
0:40:04,340 --> 0:40:05,340
 all of the stuff

754
0:40:05,340 --> 0:40:06,340
 in an email.

755
0:40:06,340 --> 0:40:07,340
 I might be writing

756
0:40:07,340 --> 0:40:08,340
 a blog post

757
0:40:08,340 --> 0:40:09,340
 and then I want

758
0:40:09,340 --> 0:40:10,340
 to redirect people

759
0:40:10,340 --> 0:40:11,340
 to the blog post

760
0:40:11,340 --> 0:40:12,340
 to actually read the rest

761
0:40:12,340 --> 0:40:14,340
 or see a video

762
0:40:14,340 --> 0:40:15,340
 on a page

763
0:40:15,340 --> 0:40:16,340
 or something like that

764
0:40:16,340 --> 0:40:18,340
 instead of just relying

765
0:40:18,340 --> 0:40:19,340
 on the open rates

766
0:40:19,340 --> 0:40:20,340
 to show me

767
0:40:20,340 --> 0:40:21,340
 how things are going.

768
0:40:21,340 --> 0:40:22,340
 Yeah.

769
0:40:24,340 --> 0:40:28,340
 Any more questions?

770
0:40:28,340 --> 0:40:29,340
 Well,

771
0:40:29,340 --> 0:40:30,340
 thank you very much.

772
0:40:30,340 --> 0:40:31,340
 Thank you.
