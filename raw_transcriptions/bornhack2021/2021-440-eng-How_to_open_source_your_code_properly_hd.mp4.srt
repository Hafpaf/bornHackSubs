0:00:00,000 --> 0:00:12,000
 Karina Haupt will talk about how to properly open source source code.

2
0:00:12,000 --> 0:00:19,000
 Give her an applause.

3
0:00:19,000 --> 0:00:24,000
 Yes, hello and thanks. As already was mentioned, my name is Karina Haupt.

4
0:00:24,000 --> 0:00:31,000
 I'm not a lawyer, I'm a software engineer or computer scientist by trade.

5
0:00:31,000 --> 0:00:38,000
 So this is all I will tell you is to my best knowledge.

6
0:00:38,000 --> 0:00:44,000
 But yeah, I'm not just a developer or software engineer.

7
0:00:44,000 --> 0:00:48,000
 I'm a head of a sustainable software engineering group and this is what I deal with.

8
0:00:48,000 --> 0:00:52,000
 So I make software more usable for others.

9
0:00:52,000 --> 0:00:54,000
 And this is exactly why I'm here.

10
0:00:54,000 --> 0:00:58,000
 I'm also a big fan of open source and I'm an open source enthusiast.

11
0:00:58,000 --> 0:01:01,000
 And this is why I'm giving this talk today.

12
0:01:01,000 --> 0:01:04,000
 I work for the German Aerospace Center.

13
0:01:04,000 --> 0:01:09,000
 Yeah, where I'm supporting scientists to develop software in a sustainable way.

14
0:01:09,000 --> 0:01:16,000
 And also, I'm there part of a team which consults people regarding open source licenses and open source publishing.

15
0:01:16,000 --> 0:01:22,000
 And so this talk is something I talk a lot about during my work also in my free time.

16
0:01:22,000 --> 0:01:24,000
 Because yeah, open source.

17
0:01:24,000 --> 0:01:26,000
 I'm an open source fan.

18
0:01:26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
 So as the title says, I want to tell you about how you open source your code properly.

19
0:01:32,000 --> 0:01:36,000
 Because most of the code out there isn't open source properly.

20
0:01:36,000 --> 0:01:38,000
 But it's really helpful.

21
0:01:38,000 --> 0:01:46,000
 So the idea is that you get away from the right side where you have your closed source which looks like a mess.

22
0:01:46,000 --> 0:01:48,000
 And you don't want to share with people.

23
0:01:48,000 --> 0:01:51,000
 And this is also an argument I hear the most if I say you should share your code.

24
0:01:51,000 --> 0:01:52,000
 Oh, it's a mess.

25
0:01:52,000 --> 0:01:54,000
 I don't want to show it to others.

26
0:01:54,000 --> 0:01:56,000
 I don't want to show it to you.

27
0:01:56,000 --> 0:01:58,000
 So I'm going to show you the behavior on the left where you say, yeah, clear.

28
0:01:58,000 --> 0:02:00,000
 It's there on GitHub.

29
0:02:00,000 --> 0:02:02,000
 Use it for free.

30
0:02:02,000 --> 0:02:06,000
 And it's not only about the idea that you're happy to share your code.

31
0:02:06,000 --> 0:02:12,000
 It's also about the other person being able to use your code in a properly and safe way.

32
0:02:12,000 --> 0:02:15,000
 And this is the one I want to talk about.

33
0:02:15,000 --> 0:02:18,000
 How you can achieve this.

34
0:02:18,000 --> 0:02:22,000
 So let's first talk really quickly about free software.

35
0:02:22,000 --> 0:02:24,000
 What is free or open source software?

36
0:02:24,000 --> 0:02:26,000
 So first it was called free software.

37
0:02:26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
 But this didn't really went well with industry because it sounded like it's free like in free beer.

38
0:02:32,000 --> 0:02:36,000
 So they introduced the term open source.

39
0:02:36,000 --> 0:02:41,000
 But the thing is free is like not in free beer.

40
0:02:41,000 --> 0:02:43,000
 It's in freedom.

41
0:02:43,000 --> 0:02:47,000
 So the idea of free software is that the user has all the freedoms.

42
0:02:47,000 --> 0:02:50,000
 This means to run the software, to copy, to modify it.

43
0:02:50,000 --> 0:02:52,000
 To distribute it.

44
0:02:52,000 --> 0:02:53,000
 To use it.

45
0:02:53,000 --> 0:02:54,000
 To share it.

46
0:02:54,000 --> 0:02:55,000
 To share it with others.

47
0:02:55,000 --> 0:02:57,000
 And so on and so on.

48
0:02:57,000 --> 0:02:59,000
 So this is the idea.

49
0:02:59,000 --> 0:03:02,000
 I think most of you know about that.

50
0:03:02,000 --> 0:03:06,000
 But I always include it to make sure.

51
0:03:06,000 --> 0:03:10,000
 And there's a lot of cases where you can what you can do with open source.

52
0:03:10,000 --> 0:03:12,000
 So you can use it, obviously.

53
0:03:12,000 --> 0:03:20,000
 Nearly all software on this planet you have the feeling is run using open source software if it's not open source itself.

54
0:03:20,000 --> 0:03:22,000
 I mean, the Internet wouldn't exist in a way.

55
0:03:22,000 --> 0:03:34,000
 But it's also about how you make external contributions or get external contributions to your open source project where you have to think about a lot of things about open source as well if you contribute to open source.

56
0:03:34,000 --> 0:03:43,000
 So all of these use cases where you deal with open source sound totally basic, but all of them require you to think about certain things and ensure certain things.

57
0:03:43,000 --> 0:03:50,000
 Because open source is not just an idea or a mentality.

58
0:03:50,000 --> 0:03:51,000
 It has a legal basis.

59
0:03:51,000 --> 0:03:58,000
 So since I'm from Germany, this is a little bit put on German law.

60
0:03:58,000 --> 0:04:01,000
 But it's quite similar in most of Europe.

61
0:04:01,000 --> 0:04:06,000
 So in Germany we have the so-called .

62
0:04:06,000 --> 0:04:08,000
 Normally you call it copyright.

63
0:04:08,000 --> 0:04:13,000
 Which means that you can protect something.

64
0:04:13,000 --> 0:04:16,000
 But you can't protect ideas and principles.

65
0:04:16,000 --> 0:04:19,000
 So normally you have to do, like, source code and object code and stuff.

66
0:04:19,000 --> 0:04:20,000
 You can't do something.

67
0:04:20,000 --> 0:04:21,000
 Yeah.

68
0:04:21,000 --> 0:04:22,000
 So the copyright is a very important thing.

69
0:04:22,000 --> 0:04:31,000
 The important thing is that...

70
0:04:31,000 --> 0:04:36,000
 The copyright says first that if you write something, you own it.

71
0:04:36,000 --> 0:04:39,000
 So you have some rights on it.

72
0:04:39,000 --> 0:04:46,000
 But on the same time, if you work for somebody...

73
0:04:46,000 --> 0:04:49,000
 They get the rights to...

74
0:04:49,000 --> 0:04:56,000
 To work with it.

75
0:04:56,000 --> 0:04:57,000
 So it's like the...

76
0:04:57,000 --> 0:04:59,000
 In German it's called .

77
0:04:59,000 --> 0:05:01,000
 So it means you have the right to...

78
0:05:01,000 --> 0:05:03,000
 Great.

79
0:05:03,000 --> 0:05:05,000
 I'm missing a word in English.

80
0:05:05,000 --> 0:05:07,000
 You have the rights to do...

81
0:05:07,000 --> 0:05:08,000
 Yeah.

82
0:05:08,000 --> 0:05:15,000
 You have all the rights to sell it, to open source it, or whatever.

83
0:05:15,000 --> 0:05:17,000
 So you have the rights to decide what happens with it.

84
0:05:17,000 --> 0:05:23,000
 But you don't get the right, at least in Germany, that you can say you wrote it.

85
0:05:23,000 --> 0:05:28,000
 So whenever you write a code, even if you work for somebody else or if you get paid to do it,

86
0:05:28,000 --> 0:05:30,000
 you're still allowed to say it's yours.

87
0:05:30,000 --> 0:05:33,000
 And they are not allowed to say they did it instead of you.

88
0:05:33,000 --> 0:05:38,000
 So this is a small differentiation which is really important.

89
0:05:38,000 --> 0:05:42,000
 What is important is that it's based on laws.

90
0:05:42,000 --> 0:05:45,000
 And open source licenses are contracts.

91
0:05:45,000 --> 0:05:53,000
 Meaning if you don't follow them, if you just use something in a way you're not allowed

92
0:05:53,000 --> 0:05:57,000
 to, then you break a contract and you can get in trouble.

93
0:05:57,000 --> 0:06:04,000
 So there's civil law and criminal law which protects the open source developer or the

94
0:06:04,000 --> 0:06:11,240
 one who writes the code, as well as can, yeah, be used against you if you don't use open

95
0:06:11,240 --> 0:06:13,000
 source software in the right way.

96
0:06:13,000 --> 0:06:15,000
 This sounds a bit strange.

97
0:06:15,000 --> 0:06:16,000
 It's scary.

98
0:06:16,000 --> 0:06:19,000
 But in reality, the open source community is really nice.

99
0:06:19,000 --> 0:06:23,000
 So normally you get a pointer, like you did something wrong, you have to update something,

100
0:06:23,000 --> 0:06:27,000
 you have to do something to follow certain rules.

101
0:06:27,000 --> 0:06:29,000
 And then you're fine.

102
0:06:29,000 --> 0:06:37,000
 So most times when lawyers and stuff gets included in the process is normally when big

103
0:06:37,000 --> 0:06:45,000
 companies don't agree to that their stuff is protected by an open source license or

104
0:06:45,000 --> 0:06:47,000
 they are using stuff which is protected under an open source license.

105
0:06:47,000 --> 0:06:49,000
 They didn't want to comply.

106
0:06:49,000 --> 0:06:55,000
 So they get in trouble.

107
0:06:55,000 --> 0:07:03,000
 This, so before I start with open source licenses, details and stuff, I want to present you a

108
0:07:03,000 --> 0:07:09,000
 process, you could say, for publishing software, which we introduced at my work.

109
0:07:09,000 --> 0:07:14,000
 So it's a German Aerospace Center and which counts for nearly all companies.

110
0:07:14,000 --> 0:07:18,000
 So where you work when you want to publish something or even most of the stuff you have

111
0:07:18,000 --> 0:07:20,000
 to check also when you do it on your own.

112
0:07:20,000 --> 0:07:22,000
 It doesn't matter if you're part of a company.

113
0:07:22,000 --> 0:07:26,000
 It's just one or two things which are a little bit special then.

114
0:07:26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
 For example, the first thing is just when you don't publish your own code, or it's your

115
0:07:32,000 --> 0:07:36,000
 own code, but one which you wrote while you're employed somewhere or something or where you

116
0:07:36,000 --> 0:07:37,000
 get paid for it.

117
0:07:37,000 --> 0:07:42,000
 So the first thing is you have to ask your organization if you're allowed to publish

118
0:07:42,000 --> 0:07:43,000
 it.

119
0:07:43,000 --> 0:07:47,000
 It sounds really, really default, but in research, a lot of people just publish code

120
0:07:47,000 --> 0:07:50,000
 without asking their bosses or something.

121
0:07:50,000 --> 0:07:54,000
 And on the one hand, I love it that there's more open source code out there.

122
0:07:54,000 --> 0:07:59,000
 But in the end, the problem is that it's not really theirs to decide because while they

123
0:07:59,000 --> 0:08:08,000
 have the right to be named as an author, they don't have the right to commercialize or whatever

124
0:08:08,000 --> 0:08:13,000
 to distribute the software further because all of this kind of rights are with the employee.

125
0:08:13,000 --> 0:08:14,000
 Normally.

126
0:08:14,000 --> 0:08:18,000
 So this is normally stated in your contract that everything you do while you work is owned

127
0:08:18,000 --> 0:08:20,000
 by your employee.

128
0:08:20,000 --> 0:08:23,000
 So ask him first.

129
0:08:23,000 --> 0:08:29,000
 Second, and that's where it gets tricky, is to determine all legal requirements and resulting

130
0:08:29,000 --> 0:08:36,000
 tasks out of those, meaning you have to check, am I allowed to publish my code as open source

131
0:08:36,000 --> 0:08:37,000
 software?

132
0:08:37,000 --> 0:08:42,000
 And if so, do I have perhaps something I have to do?

133
0:08:42,000 --> 0:08:44,000
 Do I have something I have to care about?

134
0:08:44,000 --> 0:08:49,000
 Or am I perhaps restricted in the type of licenses I'm allowed to use?

135
0:08:49,000 --> 0:08:51,000
 And so on.

136
0:08:51,000 --> 0:08:54,000
 So there's different things you have to think about.

137
0:08:54,000 --> 0:08:56,000
 The first one is who are your contributors?

138
0:08:56,000 --> 0:08:58,000
 Is it just you?

139
0:08:58,000 --> 0:09:00,000
 Did other people help?

140
0:09:00,000 --> 0:09:05,000
 If so, they have to agree that you publish it.

141
0:09:05,000 --> 0:09:10,000
 So as soon as you gather an external contributor or your colleague or friend or whoever who

142
0:09:10,000 --> 0:09:12,000
 works on the same code too, they have to agree too.

143
0:09:12,000 --> 0:09:17,000
 So you have to make sure that it gets published, except if it's all owned by the same employee,

144
0:09:17,000 --> 0:09:19,000
 then they can decide.

145
0:09:19,000 --> 0:09:25,000
 So you first have to identify everybody so that they on the one hand agree if they have

146
0:09:25,000 --> 0:09:30,000
 the rights or that you name them at least as an author because everybody who participated

147
0:09:30,000 --> 0:09:32,000
 has the right to be called as an author.

148
0:09:32,000 --> 0:09:37,000
 So you normally write an author txt or something like that so that you can say, okay, this

149
0:09:37,000 --> 0:09:39,000
 is the people who helped.

150
0:09:39,000 --> 0:09:42,000
 This is the people who worked on that because they have the right to be named.

151
0:09:42,000 --> 0:09:49,000
 Then something nearly nobody thinks about is something called export restrictions.

152
0:09:49,000 --> 0:09:54,000
 And I would be interested if anybody with a show of hands, if anybody knows what export

153
0:09:54,000 --> 0:09:55,000
 restrictions are.

154
0:09:55,000 --> 0:09:56,000
 I've heard about that.

155
0:09:56,000 --> 0:09:57,000
 Okay.

156
0:09:57,000 --> 0:10:01,000
 We have like four here or five people know about that.

157
0:10:01,000 --> 0:10:06,000
 How many have thought about checking those when you publish software as open source?

158
0:10:06,000 --> 0:10:08,000
 Show of hands.

159
0:10:08,000 --> 0:10:09,000
 Nobody.

160
0:10:09,000 --> 0:10:10,000
 Yeah.

161
0:10:10,000 --> 0:10:11,000
 That's normally the typical amount of writing.

162
0:10:11,000 --> 0:10:12,000
 Okay.

163
0:10:12,000 --> 0:10:15,000
 So I'm going to show you a few examples of what I've got here.

164
0:10:15,000 --> 0:10:19,000
 So normally export restrictions are known for stuff like weapons and things, but it's

165
0:10:19,000 --> 0:10:23,000
 also the same for software.

166
0:10:23,000 --> 0:10:29,000
 In Europe, it's quite easy to estimate if something can use or is used in a military

167
0:10:29,000 --> 0:10:31,000
 way, you have export restrictions.

168
0:10:31,000 --> 0:10:40,000
 In the US, it's a little bit more complicated because they have this dual use thing, meaning

169
0:10:40,000 --> 0:10:41,000
 stuff can be used in a military context.

170
0:10:41,000 --> 0:10:44,000
 So you can use it in a military context as well in a civilian context.

171
0:10:44,000 --> 0:10:46,000
 And nearly everything is dual use.

172
0:10:46,000 --> 0:10:52,000
 For example, Microsoft Excel is dual use because you can use it in a military way to do something,

173
0:10:52,000 --> 0:10:54,000
 to calculate whatever.

174
0:10:54,000 --> 0:11:00,000
 So you have to check if it's under the export restrictions, but luckily with stuff like

175
0:11:00,000 --> 0:11:05,000
 Microsoft Excel or whatever, they are under restrictions, but they don't have any restrictions.

176
0:11:05,000 --> 0:11:10,000
 So as they are listed somewhere or fits the description of certain categories, they are

177
0:11:10,000 --> 0:11:12,000
 under the export restrictions.

178
0:11:12,000 --> 0:11:15,000
 But you don't get any restrictions.

179
0:11:15,000 --> 0:11:17,000
 But there's other stuff which is restricted.

180
0:11:17,000 --> 0:11:24,000
 So specific cryptography or something, especially if you go to all these things, then you get

181
0:11:24,000 --> 0:11:26,000
 in trouble if you want to export it somewhere.

182
0:11:26,000 --> 0:11:30,000
 And if you publish it as open source, this normally means you export it to the whole

183
0:11:30,000 --> 0:11:31,000
 world.

184
0:11:31,000 --> 0:11:37,000
 And as I said, in the European law, it's not a big issue, but the US law is important for

185
0:11:37,000 --> 0:11:40,000
 us because it's valid as soon as possible.

186
0:11:40,000 --> 0:11:47,000
 So if you have a code which is in a whole car or something, one screw which is from

187
0:11:47,000 --> 0:11:51,000
 the US, one tiny screw, you have to follow the US export laws.

188
0:11:51,000 --> 0:11:53,000
 And same is for software.

189
0:11:53,000 --> 0:11:57,000
 And you can perhaps imagine that might be if you use some libraries or stuff, there

190
0:11:57,000 --> 0:11:59,000
 might be some code which came from the US.

191
0:11:59,000 --> 0:12:01,000
 So suddenly it's under US export law.

192
0:12:01,000 --> 0:12:03,000
 So you have to check.

193
0:12:03,000 --> 0:12:08,000
 As a private person writing your small game or whatever, this might be a bit of a challenge

194
0:12:08,000 --> 0:12:09,000
 for you.

195
0:12:09,000 --> 0:12:14,000
 As a research facility, we have to check this regularly, especially that you don't

196
0:12:14,000 --> 0:12:19,000
 get in trouble because the US has some crazy ideas who are evil people, and so you're

197
0:12:19,000 --> 0:12:24,000
 not allowed to publish it as open source, so you can get in trouble with them.

198
0:12:24,000 --> 0:12:30,000
 Then, again, this is perhaps a little bit specific for research facilities, but it might

199
0:12:30,000 --> 0:12:36,000
 be depending on where you work or how you perhaps get some funding for your open source

200
0:12:36,000 --> 0:12:37,000
 project.

201
0:12:37,000 --> 0:12:38,000
 So that's one thing.

202
0:12:38,000 --> 0:12:42,000
 If you're part of a bigger open source project, if you're part of a bigger project, you have

203
0:12:42,000 --> 0:12:46,000
 to check if there's some conditions with the funding.

204
0:12:46,000 --> 0:12:51,000
 So for example, in Europe, there's a research program called Horizon 2020.

205
0:12:51,000 --> 0:12:53,000
 Perhaps some of you have heard of that.

206
0:12:53,000 --> 0:12:55,000
 I don't know if you're close to research.

207
0:12:55,000 --> 0:13:01,000
 And they say sometimes you're allowed to or you have to publish it as open source, which

208
0:13:01,000 --> 0:13:03,000
 is amazing if they do this.

209
0:13:03,000 --> 0:13:08,000
 But sometimes they say it has to be under a permissive license or a copyleft license.

210
0:13:08,000 --> 0:13:09,000
 And what does this exactly mean?

211
0:13:09,000 --> 0:13:11,000
 I'll come to a little bit later.

212
0:13:11,000 --> 0:13:13,000
 But so you have to check what they say.

213
0:13:13,000 --> 0:13:19,000
 And also it can be that you signed a contract with a company where you wrote something or

214
0:13:19,000 --> 0:13:23,000
 a part of what you did there gets into your other project.

215
0:13:23,000 --> 0:13:28,000
 And somewhere in the small letters on page, I don't know, 130, it says everything which

216
0:13:28,000 --> 0:13:33,000
 results out of this project is not allowed to be published as open source, which is for

217
0:13:33,000 --> 0:13:38,000
 us, for example, the case with some bigger companies who write this in all their contracts.

218
0:13:38,000 --> 0:13:42,000
 So everything we produce or get the ideas from in this project, we're not allowed to

219
0:13:42,000 --> 0:13:44,000
 open source.

220
0:13:44,000 --> 0:13:48,000
 The best solution is if you have something before which you put in, open source it before.

221
0:13:48,000 --> 0:13:52,000
 So it's already open source, so they can't do anything about it.

222
0:13:52,000 --> 0:13:56,000
 But you should always check if you signed some funding contracts because there can be

223
0:13:56,000 --> 0:14:00,000
 stuff written somewhere down there regarding the rights or yeah.

224
0:14:00,000 --> 0:14:04,000
 And suddenly you have this big, big project or something and there was this one tiny part

225
0:14:04,000 --> 0:14:06,000
 and now you're not allowed to publish it.

226
0:14:06,000 --> 0:14:07,000
 Again, something.

227
0:14:07,000 --> 0:14:10,000
 A lot of people don't think about and check.

228
0:14:10,000 --> 0:14:11,000
 And I don't know.

229
0:14:11,000 --> 0:14:13,000
 Is here some people from research?

230
0:14:13,000 --> 0:14:15,000
 Show of hands.

231
0:14:15,000 --> 0:14:16,000
 Oh, yeah.

232
0:14:16,000 --> 0:14:18,000
 One, three.

233
0:14:18,000 --> 0:14:24,000
 So perhaps those of you know, the history of research project is that you get funding

234
0:14:24,000 --> 0:14:27,000
 and the next funding and the next funding and it's over years and years and decades.

235
0:14:27,000 --> 0:14:31,000
 And in the end, it's really hard to figure out like where did the funding come from?

236
0:14:31,000 --> 0:14:33,000
 Do we have some restrictions?

237
0:14:33,000 --> 0:14:36,000
 So you have to note all the stuff down early when you get the money.

238
0:14:36,000 --> 0:14:37,000
 There's no restrictions.

239
0:14:37,000 --> 0:14:38,000
 There's no regulations or something.

240
0:14:38,000 --> 0:14:39,000
 Note it somewhere close to your project.

241
0:14:39,000 --> 0:14:43,000
 This is really helpful later.

242
0:14:43,000 --> 0:14:45,000
 And now comes this part which everybody needs to do.

243
0:14:45,000 --> 0:14:51,000
 And this is as soon as, at least as soon as you use code which is not yours.

244
0:14:51,000 --> 0:14:56,000
 Especially libraries, which is completely normal today, I think, to have some code from

245
0:14:56,000 --> 0:14:57,000
 others which you use.

246
0:14:57,000 --> 0:15:02,000
 So you have to check for the third party code regarding the licenses.

247
0:15:02,000 --> 0:15:06,000
 And we'll talk about this a lot in the next part.

248
0:15:06,000 --> 0:15:12,000
 But before I come to one more part which is if you have done all of this, you will have

249
0:15:12,000 --> 0:15:14,000
 a set of things which you need to do.

250
0:15:14,000 --> 0:15:17,000
 So this will be the second part also or third part.

251
0:15:17,000 --> 0:15:20,000
 It depends on the kind of talk.

252
0:15:20,000 --> 0:15:24,000
 And you have to evaluate a little bit.

253
0:15:24,000 --> 0:15:25,000
 Is it worth doing it?

254
0:15:25,000 --> 0:15:28,000
 In my opinion, nearly all cases, yes.

255
0:15:28,000 --> 0:15:29,000
 Do your stuff open source.

256
0:15:29,000 --> 0:15:31,000
 Do it properly.

257
0:15:31,000 --> 0:15:34,000
 Work on the project from the beginning that you can do it easily.

258
0:15:34,000 --> 0:15:35,000
 But sometimes you have to check.

259
0:15:35,000 --> 0:15:38,000
 Sometimes you have to check if the effort is worth it.

260
0:15:38,000 --> 0:15:40,000
 And especially who would benefit from it.

261
0:15:40,000 --> 0:15:43,000
 Is there somebody else who would use it?

262
0:15:43,000 --> 0:15:47,000
 And in some cases, it's true to say, yeah, it doesn't make sense a lot.

263
0:15:47,000 --> 0:15:48,000
 It would be a lot of work.

264
0:15:48,000 --> 0:15:52,000
 Or we would have to rewrite big parts because of some funding restrictions.

265
0:15:52,000 --> 0:15:56,000
 Or we can't give everything out because of some export restriction or something.

266
0:15:56,000 --> 0:15:59,000
 And so it doesn't make sense to publish it then.

267
0:15:59,000 --> 0:16:01,000
 Sadly, that's sometimes the case.

268
0:16:01,000 --> 0:16:05,000
 But you should always think about, okay, what do I need to do?

269
0:16:05,000 --> 0:16:07,000
 Is it worth it?

270
0:16:07,000 --> 0:16:13,000
 So I stepped quite quickly about this analyze license terms of third party code.

271
0:16:13,000 --> 0:16:17,000
 And this is kind of what open source is a lot about.

272
0:16:17,000 --> 0:16:19,000
 It's like open source licenses.

273
0:16:19,000 --> 0:16:26,000
 And that's why we now do an excourse to the world of open source software licenses.

274
0:16:26,000 --> 0:16:34,000
 And in general, it's really fun to talk for me, at least, to talk about software licenses.

275
0:16:34,000 --> 0:16:35,000
 Not everybody.

276
0:16:35,000 --> 0:16:37,000
 It's a kind of dry topic.

277
0:16:37,000 --> 0:16:43,000
 But I'm happy a lot of people or some people showed up to be interested in this.

278
0:16:43,000 --> 0:16:46,000
 And so in general, you can say there's all these software licenses.

279
0:16:46,000 --> 0:16:48,000
 And there's three types.

280
0:16:48,000 --> 0:16:52,000
 The free and open source software licenses, which we talk about today the most.

281
0:16:52,000 --> 0:16:59,000
 Then there's public domain, where a lot of people think this is open source, but it isn't.

282
0:16:59,000 --> 0:17:01,000
 As well as proprietary.

283
0:17:01,000 --> 0:17:04,000
 And a lot of people think proprietary means commercial.

284
0:17:04,000 --> 0:17:06,000
 But this is not the case.

285
0:17:06,000 --> 0:17:09,000
 Proprietary means everything which is not free and open source or public domain.

286
0:17:09,000 --> 0:17:12,000
 It can be commercial, but it doesn't have to be.

287
0:17:12,000 --> 0:17:17,000
 So there's like shareware stuff in the early days or stuff which is proprietary.

288
0:17:17,000 --> 0:17:19,000
 But it might be free to use.

289
0:17:19,000 --> 0:17:22,000
 You might even have access to the code.

290
0:17:22,000 --> 0:17:25,000
 But it means it doesn't give you all the rights I mentioned in the beginning.

291
0:17:25,000 --> 0:17:32,000
 So free and open source licenses always give you the right to use, to modify, to distribute, and so on and so on.

292
0:17:32,000 --> 0:17:34,000
 So you have certain rights you get.

293
0:17:34,000 --> 0:17:38,000
 And if you get those, it's a free and open source software license.

294
0:17:38,000 --> 0:17:44,000
 Important to know is that the term open source software license or something is not protected.

295
0:17:44,000 --> 0:17:48,000
 So there's licenses out there who claim to be open source but aren't.

296
0:17:48,000 --> 0:17:52,000
 For example, a quite common one is one which states something like,

297
0:17:52,000 --> 0:17:57,000
 you're allowed to do all these things for open source, but you're not allowed to use it for something evil.

298
0:17:57,000 --> 0:17:59,000
 It sounds really good.

299
0:17:59,000 --> 0:18:01,000
 It sounds like a great idea.

300
0:18:01,000 --> 0:18:04,000
 But the problem is who says what is evil and what isn't.

301
0:18:04,000 --> 0:18:07,000
 To draw certain lines really, really hard.

302
0:18:07,000 --> 0:18:12,000
 And again, free and open source software, it's about non-discrimination.

303
0:18:12,000 --> 0:18:16,000
 So it doesn't matter what you use it for, who you are, where you're from or something.

304
0:18:16,000 --> 0:18:18,000
 You're allowed to do all the same things.

305
0:18:18,000 --> 0:18:20,000
 And this is important.

306
0:18:20,000 --> 0:18:24,000
 So even if it feels like a good idea to exclude military use or whatever,

307
0:18:24,000 --> 0:18:28,000
 it's not matching the idea of open source software.

308
0:18:28,000 --> 0:18:35,000
 In the world of free and open source software licenses,

309
0:18:35,000 --> 0:18:38,000
 there's two types of licenses.

310
0:18:38,000 --> 0:18:40,000
 Most perhaps know this.

311
0:18:40,000 --> 0:18:42,000
 One is copyleft.

312
0:18:42,000 --> 0:18:44,000
 So this was a copyleft.

313
0:18:44,000 --> 0:18:47,000
 The most well-known is the one with GPL.

314
0:18:47,000 --> 0:18:50,000
 And these licenses are effective.

315
0:18:50,000 --> 0:18:57,000
 Meaning they come with the moral idea that everything which is free,

316
0:18:58,000 --> 0:19:01,000
 should stay free, even if you modified it.

317
0:19:01,000 --> 0:19:06,000
 And everything which is building on something which is free also should be free.

318
0:19:06,000 --> 0:19:14,000
 This means as soon as you get a little bit software which is licensed under copyleft into your code,

319
0:19:14,000 --> 0:19:18,000
 it all has to be, the whole software in the total, has to be free.

320
0:19:18,000 --> 0:19:25,000
 Often it even says it has to be published under the same or compatible license.

321
0:19:25,000 --> 0:19:27,000
 Then on the other hand,

322
0:19:27,000 --> 0:19:29,000
 there's another idea.

323
0:19:29,000 --> 0:19:31,000
 That's the permissive licenses.

324
0:19:31,000 --> 0:19:38,000
 Well-known examples there are MIT, Apache, BSD.

325
0:19:38,000 --> 0:19:42,000
 They come from the idea that you should have the freedom to do really everything.

326
0:19:42,000 --> 0:19:45,000
 So even put it in a commercial product.

327
0:19:45,000 --> 0:19:50,000
 Or change something and bring it onto your own license.

328
0:19:50,000 --> 0:19:55,000
 So the idea is really freedom until the end.

329
0:19:55,000 --> 0:19:56,000
 So everything should stay free.

330
0:19:56,000 --> 0:19:58,000
 And on the other hand,

331
0:19:58,000 --> 0:20:03,000
 the freedom to do really everything.

332
0:20:03,000 --> 0:20:06,000
 I prefer the permissive licenses myself.

333
0:20:06,000 --> 0:20:12,000
 Because I think it's important that we can also use it in parts which might be sold or commercially in some parts.

334
0:20:12,000 --> 0:20:14,000
 Because this can help getting funding.

335
0:20:14,000 --> 0:20:18,000
 And there's a lot of mixtures and possibilities.

336
0:20:18,000 --> 0:20:20,000
 Copyleft sounds like a great idea.

337
0:20:20,000 --> 0:20:24,000
 But can happen that people don't use it because they can't use it to all the stuffs.

338
0:20:24,000 --> 0:20:25,000
 Although,

339
0:20:25,000 --> 0:20:29,000
 because of this type of different licenses,

340
0:20:29,000 --> 0:20:33,000
 we can get into the field of license incompatibilities.

341
0:20:33,000 --> 0:20:37,000
 The easiest example is if you have two copyleft licenses,

342
0:20:37,000 --> 0:20:41,000
 which both say you have to publish the result or the result has to be,

343
0:20:41,000 --> 0:20:47,000
 the whole software has to be under their own license.

344
0:20:47,000 --> 0:20:50,000
 The problem is you can't do both at the same time.

345
0:20:50,000 --> 0:20:53,000
 So if I put two libraries under two different licenses,

346
0:20:53,000 --> 0:20:54,000
 a copyleft license,

347
0:20:54,000 --> 0:20:56,000
 into my code,

348
0:20:56,000 --> 0:20:58,000
 I have the problem that the software,

349
0:20:58,000 --> 0:21:01,000
 the one license says the software has to be under this license A,

350
0:21:01,000 --> 0:21:04,000
 and the other one says it has to be under license B.

351
0:21:04,000 --> 0:21:07,000
 And while there's something like dual licensing,

352
0:21:07,000 --> 0:21:16,000
 then each product would still be breaching the other license.

353
0:21:16,000 --> 0:21:23,000
 So it can't be under the same executable or one you can create can be just under one license.

354
0:21:24,000 --> 0:21:30,000
 So this results in something I always call like impossible software

355
0:21:30,000 --> 0:21:31,000
 because you can build it,

356
0:21:31,000 --> 0:21:33,000
 you can use it for yourself,

357
0:21:33,000 --> 0:21:37,000
 but you can't distribute it because in that moment you breached one of the licenses.

358
0:21:37,000 --> 0:21:44,000
 And this is a big problem with copyleft licenses especially.

359
0:21:44,000 --> 0:21:47,000
 So this is about if you have a single license.

360
0:21:47,000 --> 0:21:48,000
 Picking one is really easy,

361
0:21:48,000 --> 0:21:51,000
 but if you reuse and combine stuff,

362
0:21:51,000 --> 0:21:53,000
 it can be really complicated.

363
0:21:53,000 --> 0:22:02,000
 So what I want to show you now is really at first a little bit like frightening graphic,

364
0:22:02,000 --> 0:22:07,000
 which is about combining modules under different licenses.

365
0:22:07,000 --> 0:22:11,000
 And I want to give you a quick overview about what this means

366
0:22:11,000 --> 0:22:16,000
 because this is normally where it gets complicated really quickly for a lot of people.

367
0:22:16,000 --> 0:22:18,000
 So in the orange thingy on the corner,

368
0:22:18,000 --> 0:22:20,000
 we have your own software component,

369
0:22:20,000 --> 0:22:23,000
 which you wrote, whatever.

370
0:22:23,000 --> 0:22:30,000
 And now you combine it with a copyleft component.

371
0:22:30,000 --> 0:22:35,000
 Here there's even a differentiation between copyleft or the components with copyleft

372
0:22:35,000 --> 0:22:38,000
 or license with a copyleft with strong copyleft

373
0:22:38,000 --> 0:22:43,000
 or here strongly reciprocal and a standard reciprocal.

374
0:22:43,000 --> 0:22:46,000
 I hope I pronounced that right.

375
0:22:46,000 --> 0:22:49,000
 So normally it's called strong and weak copyleft.

376
0:22:49,000 --> 0:22:50,000
 With a strong copyleft,

377
0:22:50,000 --> 0:22:52,000
 GPL, most famous example,

378
0:22:52,000 --> 0:22:55,000
 it means you combine your stuff.

379
0:22:55,000 --> 0:22:58,000
 So if you use it as a normal library

380
0:22:58,000 --> 0:23:00,000
 or if you change something on that code,

381
0:23:00,000 --> 0:23:02,000
 on this component,

382
0:23:02,000 --> 0:23:04,000
 it's a derivative work

383
0:23:04,000 --> 0:23:07,000
 and it has to be under the license like the GPL.

384
0:23:07,000 --> 0:23:10,000
 It has to stay under that.

385
0:23:10,000 --> 0:23:12,000
 This is the right case like so.

386
0:23:12,000 --> 0:23:18,000
 So it means it keeps the same rights and laws you have to fulfill.

387
0:23:18,000 --> 0:23:19,000
 On the left,

388
0:23:19,000 --> 0:23:21,000
 you see there's another possibility,

389
0:23:21,000 --> 0:23:24,000
 which is called combined work with strong separation.

390
0:23:24,000 --> 0:23:26,000
 This is a tricky one.

391
0:23:26,000 --> 0:23:33,000
 So it means there is a way to kind of get a bit around about the GPL.

392
0:23:33,000 --> 0:23:36,000
 But as soon as you try to get around it,

393
0:23:36,000 --> 0:23:38,000
 it don't be used in a proper way,

394
0:23:38,000 --> 0:23:41,000
 you're kind of already screwed up and you can't use this way.

395
0:23:41,000 --> 0:23:44,000
 So it normally means a good example how you can do is,

396
0:23:44,000 --> 0:23:50,000
 imagine you have a tool which do some data analysis

397
0:23:50,000 --> 0:23:55,000
 and it will create a nice PDF with some graphs on it.

398
0:23:55,000 --> 0:23:58,000
 And so you include into your project,

399
0:23:58,000 --> 0:24:02,000
 into your small analysis and graph writing thingy,

400
0:24:02,000 --> 0:24:03,000
 PDF viewer.

401
0:24:03,000 --> 0:24:05,000
 And use one which is under GPL.

402
0:24:05,000 --> 0:24:08,000
 You put it in and you kind of already created the PDF

403
0:24:08,000 --> 0:24:11,000
 and you call it via a command line comment from in your code

404
0:24:11,000 --> 0:24:13,000
 like run this tool,

405
0:24:13,000 --> 0:24:17,000
 open it up in a separate window or something and show this PDF.

406
0:24:17,000 --> 0:24:20,000
 This you would call a combined work with strong separation.

407
0:24:20,000 --> 0:24:22,000
 This would be fine.

408
0:24:22,000 --> 0:24:25,000
 Then the PDF viewer would be GPL

409
0:24:25,000 --> 0:24:27,000
 and you can do with your code whatever you want.

410
0:24:27,000 --> 0:24:29,000
 You can do it commercially,

411
0:24:29,000 --> 0:24:31,000
 also another copyleft or permissive license.

412
0:24:31,000 --> 0:24:33,000
 So why is this possible?

413
0:24:33,000 --> 0:24:37,000
 Because you're using officially interfaces.

414
0:24:37,000 --> 0:24:42,000
 So if you interact with this program in an interface

415
0:24:42,000 --> 0:24:45,000
 which was created by the developers,

416
0:24:45,000 --> 0:24:47,000
 by the rights owners,

417
0:24:47,000 --> 0:24:49,000
 and you say,

418
0:24:49,000 --> 0:24:53,000
 okay, I'm using this like a command line interface or something,

419
0:24:53,000 --> 0:24:54,000
 this is fine

420
0:24:54,000 --> 0:24:56,000
 because this is a normal intended use

421
0:24:56,000 --> 0:25:00,000
 by the developer who owns the rights.

422
0:25:00,000 --> 0:25:04,000
 What's not possible is to write a command line interface

423
0:25:04,000 --> 0:25:06,000
 for a tool,

424
0:25:06,000 --> 0:25:07,000
 push it there,

425
0:25:07,000 --> 0:25:09,000
 and then use this on the other side

426
0:25:09,000 --> 0:25:12,000
 or as soon as you share objects or whatever internally,

427
0:25:12,000 --> 0:25:14,000
 you're screwed anyway.

428
0:25:14,000 --> 0:25:16,000
 So this is really something which is more the idea

429
0:25:16,000 --> 0:25:18,000
 you combine tools which are already existing

430
0:25:18,000 --> 0:25:19,000
 or already running

431
0:25:19,000 --> 0:25:22,000
 and you just kind of put it in one installation thing

432
0:25:22,000 --> 0:25:24,000
 or you put it together in one interface in a way,

433
0:25:24,000 --> 0:25:27,000
 but you use it in a way like you would use the tools normally

434
0:25:27,000 --> 0:25:29,000
 if they would be standalone as well.

435
0:25:29,000 --> 0:25:31,000
 And your code has to be working standalone

436
0:25:31,000 --> 0:25:34,000
 and their code still has to be working standalone.

437
0:25:34,000 --> 0:25:36,000
 So then you can work with GPL in your stuff

438
0:25:36,000 --> 0:25:39,000
 and a common example is you have your,

439
0:25:39,000 --> 0:25:42,000
 if you have a distribution or something for Linux,

440
0:25:42,000 --> 0:25:44,000
 okay, that's a special thing,

441
0:25:44,000 --> 0:25:46,000
 but even if you have Windows or something

442
0:25:46,000 --> 0:25:48,000
 and it could be shipped with GPL applications

443
0:25:48,000 --> 0:25:50,000
 because those applications are standalone or something,

444
0:25:50,000 --> 0:25:51,000
 it's totally fine

445
0:25:51,000 --> 0:25:53,000
 and they are not influencing like all of Windows.

446
0:25:55,000 --> 0:25:58,000
 Okay, now this is like the hard copyleft,

447
0:25:58,000 --> 0:26:01,000
 so in general you can say you use copyleft,

448
0:26:01,000 --> 0:26:03,000
 you get under the license,

449
0:26:03,000 --> 0:26:06,000
 just if you have it really, really loosely coupled,

450
0:26:06,000 --> 0:26:07,000
 there's a possibility,

451
0:26:07,000 --> 0:26:09,000
 but as soon as you try to reach a state

452
0:26:09,000 --> 0:26:12,000
 by creating this barrier on your own,

453
0:26:12,000 --> 0:26:15,000
 you're screwed because here it's about intention.

454
0:26:15,000 --> 0:26:17,000
 If your intention is to get around to GPL,

455
0:26:17,000 --> 0:26:21,000
 you don't have any chance with the lawyers.

456
0:26:24,000 --> 0:26:26,000
 Because this is really strict,

457
0:26:26,000 --> 0:26:30,000
 something like weak copyleft was introduced.

458
0:26:30,000 --> 0:26:32,000
 The most well-known is the LGPL,

459
0:26:32,000 --> 0:26:34,000
 it's a lesser GPL.

460
0:26:34,000 --> 0:26:37,000
 They wanted to show that this is not as good as the real GPL,

461
0:26:37,000 --> 0:26:39,000
 but a lot of people prefer it

462
0:26:39,000 --> 0:26:42,000
 and it was introduced because there was a need for it,

463
0:26:42,000 --> 0:26:44,000
 but as I said, a lot of people prefer it

464
0:26:44,000 --> 0:26:47,000
 because you give the people a little bit more freedom,

465
0:26:47,000 --> 0:26:49,000
 to decide what they want to do.

466
0:26:49,000 --> 0:26:52,000
 So the idea is if you combine it

467
0:26:52,000 --> 0:26:55,000
 and you don't change the LGPL code or something

468
0:26:55,000 --> 0:26:57,000
 and you just use it in the library,

469
0:26:57,000 --> 0:27:00,000
 you have your work which you can put under your license

470
0:27:00,000 --> 0:27:03,000
 and you have the LGPL library which is under LGPL.

471
0:27:03,000 --> 0:27:05,000
 If somebody would ask you for your code,

472
0:27:05,000 --> 0:27:08,000
 you would have to give them the LGPL code,

473
0:27:08,000 --> 0:27:10,000
 but not your own.

474
0:27:10,000 --> 0:27:14,000
 If you change something, you might have to do this as well.

475
0:27:14,000 --> 0:27:16,000
 But it's not as simple as it sounds.

476
0:27:17,000 --> 0:27:19,000
 So you have to do it first,

477
0:27:19,000 --> 0:27:21,000
 because there still has to be a separation,

478
0:27:21,000 --> 0:27:28,000
 meaning the user has to be able to exchange the library.

479
0:27:28,000 --> 0:27:31,000
 So he has to be able to take this piece out

480
0:27:31,000 --> 0:27:33,000
 and take another LGPL library,

481
0:27:33,000 --> 0:27:35,000
 or whatever, another library in there.

482
0:27:35,000 --> 0:27:38,000
 So you perhaps have to publish some parts of your code

483
0:27:38,000 --> 0:27:41,000
 so that they are able or create a solution

484
0:27:41,000 --> 0:27:43,000
 in a way with your software architecture

485
0:27:43,000 --> 0:27:45,000
 that you can simply say,

486
0:27:45,000 --> 0:27:48,000
 okay, I'm not using this version of the library,

487
0:27:48,000 --> 0:27:49,000
 but I changed something,

488
0:27:49,000 --> 0:27:51,000
 I improved something to make it faster, whatever,

489
0:27:51,000 --> 0:27:53,000
 and I can include it in your code.

490
0:27:53,000 --> 0:27:55,000
 This has to be possible.

491
0:27:55,000 --> 0:27:57,000
 Obviously, for different programming languages,

492
0:27:57,000 --> 0:28:00,000
 this means different approaches.

493
0:28:00,000 --> 0:28:02,000
 For some, this works really well,

494
0:28:02,000 --> 0:28:06,000
 because it depends on your type of linkage and stuff.

495
0:28:06,000 --> 0:28:07,000
 Sometimes it just,

496
0:28:07,000 --> 0:28:09,000
 anyway, say you have to install it somewhere,

497
0:28:09,000 --> 0:28:11,000
 so they just install another version on their system

498
0:28:11,000 --> 0:28:12,000
 and it's fine.

499
0:28:12,000 --> 0:28:14,000
 Sometimes you have to provide a bit of your code,

500
0:28:14,000 --> 0:28:16,000
 of your APIs, of your interfaces, or whatever,

501
0:28:16,000 --> 0:28:21,000
 and especially create a specific architecture before.

502
0:28:21,000 --> 0:28:24,000
 So LGPL you can include,

503
0:28:24,000 --> 0:28:30,000
 but it might depend on how your software is.

504
0:28:30,000 --> 0:28:32,000
 If you can't fulfill this requirement,

505
0:28:32,000 --> 0:28:34,000
 then it's again a derivative work,

506
0:28:34,000 --> 0:28:38,000
 meaning the result has to be under LGPL.

507
0:28:38,000 --> 0:28:41,000
 And last, we come to the permissive components.

508
0:28:41,000 --> 0:28:43,000
 Yeah, BSD, MIT, Apache,

509
0:28:43,000 --> 0:28:46,000
 with this, the nice thing is you can do whatever.

510
0:28:46,000 --> 0:28:47,000
 If you mix it up,

511
0:28:47,000 --> 0:28:50,000
 you can put everything under your license in the end.

512
0:28:50,000 --> 0:28:52,000
 If you don't change it or something,

513
0:28:52,000 --> 0:28:54,000
 you normally say it's a combined work.

514
0:28:54,000 --> 0:28:56,000
 This is, say, stay under the license,

515
0:28:56,000 --> 0:28:58,000
 your code's done under your license,

516
0:28:58,000 --> 0:29:00,000
 and you can do whatever.

517
0:29:00,000 --> 0:29:03,000
 So with the right part,

518
0:29:03,000 --> 0:29:07,000
 you can do also proprietary software,

519
0:29:07,000 --> 0:29:11,000
 and you can do kind of whatever you want.

520
0:29:11,000 --> 0:29:12,000
 With GPL,

521
0:29:12,000 --> 0:29:15,000
 it's a little bit more complicated.

522
0:29:15,000 --> 0:29:20,000
 Commercialization is still possible,

523
0:29:20,000 --> 0:29:22,000
 but perhaps not in the way

524
0:29:22,000 --> 0:29:27,000
 like with proprietary software.

525
0:29:27,000 --> 0:29:33,000
 Okay, so I hope you could kind of follow me through this,

526
0:29:33,000 --> 0:29:35,000
 because this is kind of important

527
0:29:35,000 --> 0:29:39,000
 if you want to clean up your code.

528
0:29:39,000 --> 0:29:41,000
 So if you use GPL,

529
0:29:41,000 --> 0:29:43,000
 if you use third-party code,

530
0:29:43,000 --> 0:29:45,000
 to put this a little bit in a nutshell,

531
0:29:45,000 --> 0:29:48,000
 is you have to check the license,

532
0:29:48,000 --> 0:29:52,000
 and you have to check how you integrate it.

533
0:29:52,000 --> 0:29:53,000
 So is it a loose coupling?

534
0:29:53,000 --> 0:29:54,000
 Is this linking?

535
0:29:54,000 --> 0:29:56,000
 Is it source code, your copy?

536
0:29:56,000 --> 0:29:59,000
 And it depends also, again,

537
0:29:59,000 --> 0:30:01,000
 lastly, like how you distribute your code.

538
0:30:01,000 --> 0:30:03,000
 And this all has influence

539
0:30:03,000 --> 0:30:06,000
 on which license you can choose for your software.

540
0:30:06,000 --> 0:30:08,000
 If you use something with copyleft,

541
0:30:08,000 --> 0:30:10,000
 you might have to use exactly this copyleft license.

542
0:30:10,000 --> 0:30:15,000
 If you use something with weak copyleft,

543
0:30:15,000 --> 0:30:17,000
 it has influence on how you create your structure

544
0:30:17,000 --> 0:30:19,000
 from your code.

545
0:30:19,000 --> 0:30:20,000
 And if you have something permissive,

546
0:30:20,000 --> 0:30:23,000
 you normally are totally easily unhappy.

547
0:30:23,000 --> 0:30:26,000
 And the distribution is also kind of important,

548
0:30:26,000 --> 0:30:29,000
 because all these licenses

549
0:30:29,000 --> 0:30:33,000
 always become really active,

550
0:30:33,000 --> 0:30:34,000
 you could say,

551
0:30:34,000 --> 0:30:37,000
 when you distribute.

552
0:30:37,000 --> 0:30:39,000
 Meaning,

553
0:30:39,000 --> 0:30:42,000
 while you get all these permissions

554
0:30:42,000 --> 0:30:43,000
 to do whatever you want,

555
0:30:43,000 --> 0:30:46,000
 you have certain rights to have,

556
0:30:46,000 --> 0:30:48,000
 we have all these rights, sorry,

557
0:30:48,000 --> 0:30:49,000
 and these permissions,

558
0:30:49,000 --> 0:30:52,000
 you also have certain things you have to follow.

559
0:30:52,000 --> 0:30:56,000
 So there's some stuff you have to do.

560
0:30:56,000 --> 0:30:58,000
 The one thing we already heard is

561
0:30:58,000 --> 0:31:00,000
 it can be for copyleft to put it under the same license

562
0:31:00,000 --> 0:31:01,000
 or something.

563
0:31:01,000 --> 0:31:02,000
 This is really, really strict.

564
0:31:02,000 --> 0:31:04,000
 But there's also further small stuff,

565
0:31:04,000 --> 0:31:06,000
 which can be important depending

566
0:31:06,000 --> 0:31:09,000
 if you ship it really as an executor,

567
0:31:09,000 --> 0:31:11,000
 if you ship it as an executable,

568
0:31:11,000 --> 0:31:13,000
 or just put it somewhere and say,

569
0:31:13,000 --> 0:31:16,000
 okay, you can get it on your own.

570
0:31:16,000 --> 0:31:19,000
 And same is for third-party code.

571
0:31:19,000 --> 0:31:22,000
 If you just give instructions,

572
0:31:22,000 --> 0:31:25,000
 get yourself all these list of requirements,

573
0:31:25,000 --> 0:31:28,000
 install it on your computer or something,

574
0:31:28,000 --> 0:31:30,000
 you have to check that the result

575
0:31:30,000 --> 0:31:32,000
 is still on a compatible license,

576
0:31:32,000 --> 0:31:33,000
 and this works out,

577
0:31:33,000 --> 0:31:34,000
 but you don't have to fulfill

578
0:31:34,000 --> 0:31:36,000
 everything this license says.

579
0:31:36,000 --> 0:31:37,000
 Because licenses say stuff like

580
0:31:37,000 --> 0:31:39,000
 you have to provide the license text,

581
0:31:39,000 --> 0:31:42,000
 you have to provide, yeah,

582
0:31:42,000 --> 0:31:44,000
 sometimes for the other nodes,

583
0:31:44,000 --> 0:31:46,000
 like for GPL, if you have a GUI,

584
0:31:46,000 --> 0:31:47,000
 like an interface,

585
0:31:47,000 --> 0:31:49,000
 you have to have a hint somewhere there

586
0:31:49,000 --> 0:31:50,000
 and stuff like that.

587
0:31:50,000 --> 0:31:52,000
 It always depends on the license

588
0:31:52,000 --> 0:31:55,000
 and often on the distribution type

589
0:31:55,000 --> 0:31:57,000
 what you have to fulfill yourself

590
0:31:57,000 --> 0:31:59,000
 or which you can kind of outsource

591
0:31:59,000 --> 0:32:03,000
 to the user who's building the software themselves.

592
0:32:03,000 --> 0:32:05,000
 So this is kind of important.

593
0:32:05,000 --> 0:32:06,000
 Think about these things.

594
0:32:06,000 --> 0:32:09,000
 And I can't list it for all the licenses.

595
0:32:09,000 --> 0:32:10,000
 But most of them require

596
0:32:10,000 --> 0:32:12,000
 that you send the license text

597
0:32:12,000 --> 0:32:13,000
 or give the license text

598
0:32:13,000 --> 0:32:17,000
 and stuff like that.

599
0:32:17,000 --> 0:32:18,000
 Okay.

600
0:32:18,000 --> 0:32:20,000
 Let's get back to our process.

601
0:32:20,000 --> 0:32:22,000
 So now we have a little bit of knowledge

602
0:32:22,000 --> 0:32:23,000
 about analyzing the license term

603
0:32:23,000 --> 0:32:25,000
 of our third-party code.

604
0:32:25,000 --> 0:32:28,000
 So we might have checked what we used.

605
0:32:28,000 --> 0:32:29,000
 If it's just permissive stuff,

606
0:32:29,000 --> 0:32:31,000
 normally you can just go ahead

607
0:32:31,000 --> 0:32:33,000
 and say, okay, this is easy,

608
0:32:33,000 --> 0:32:36,000
 this is not much to do.

609
0:32:36,000 --> 0:32:39,000
 And if you have copies,

610
0:32:39,000 --> 0:32:40,000
 or you have something left or something,

611
0:32:40,000 --> 0:32:41,000
 you should check,

612
0:32:41,000 --> 0:32:43,000
 do you want to perhaps replace it

613
0:32:43,000 --> 0:32:46,000
 depending on what license you want to pick

614
0:32:46,000 --> 0:32:48,000
 and what goal you want to have.

615
0:32:48,000 --> 0:32:49,000
 So do you want it,

616
0:32:49,000 --> 0:32:51,000
 a lot of people use it freely

617
0:32:51,000 --> 0:32:52,000
 even in commercial use

618
0:32:52,000 --> 0:32:53,000
 because you perhaps get

619
0:32:53,000 --> 0:32:57,000
 some pull requests back or something,

620
0:32:57,000 --> 0:32:59,000
 get some code optimations or whatever.

621
0:32:59,000 --> 0:33:02,000
 Or do you say, okay, it should stay open

622
0:33:02,000 --> 0:33:03,000
 and it has to be,

623
0:33:03,000 --> 0:33:06,000
 it's a mentality thing.

624
0:33:06,000 --> 0:33:08,000
 So when you decide this,

625
0:33:08,000 --> 0:33:12,320
 this you are really really good so when you checked all this stuff like export

626
0:33:12,320 --> 0:33:16,000
 control and whatever you're now in a good position to say okay is it versus

627
0:33:16,000 --> 0:33:20,260
 can I publish it or do I perhaps have stuff from different copyleft licenses

628
0:33:20,260 --> 0:33:24,920
 in my thing then I have to change things first and is it worse for me to do this

629
0:33:24,920 --> 0:33:27,980
 if it's a really tiny script and you have screwed up with the copyleft

630
0:33:27,980 --> 0:33:32,540
 licenses perhaps it's too much effort but perhaps you say okay I want to do

631
0:33:32,540 --> 0:33:38,360
 this I want to do it clean so now you have to determine the details of your

632
0:33:38,360 --> 0:33:44,660
 publication and implement everything all the tasks you thought about the first

633
0:33:44,660 --> 0:33:49,540
 thing is define which license term you take and put it all in your code which

634
0:33:49,540 --> 0:33:53,060
 form of publication do you want to create executables with your ship or

635
0:33:53,060 --> 0:33:56,900
 will you just provide your code and perhaps a list of instructions how to

636
0:33:56,900 --> 0:34:02,300
 set it up and which kind of support strategy do you want to go

637
0:34:02,300 --> 0:34:02,520
 so I'm going to show you how to do that so I'm going to show you how to do that

638
0:34:02,520 --> 0:34:06,540
 so when it's just perhaps a small script you throw out there you perhaps

639
0:34:06,540 --> 0:34:10,400
 have the readme in there perhaps you have a email address which people can

640
0:34:10,400 --> 0:34:14,340
 contact or you have a nice issue tracker from github you're using to interact

641
0:34:14,340 --> 0:34:18,360
 with people if it's a big project you should think about something else like

642
0:34:18,360 --> 0:34:23,280
 do you have a forum or FAQs or how-to tutorials and whatever to support people

643
0:34:23,280 --> 0:34:28,080
 using your code and then you have to prepare your software for publication

644
0:34:28,080 --> 0:34:31,920
 and this will be a little bit what we'll talk about a little bit later what this

645
0:34:31,920 --> 0:34:32,160
 means

646
0:34:32,520 --> 0:34:39,000
 because throwing your code out there might seem helpful but often isn't

647
0:34:39,000 --> 0:34:44,760
 because I mean how many people have perhaps found some code but there was no

648
0:34:44,760 --> 0:34:50,580
 documentation no so you had no clue how to run it or how to install it or you

649
0:34:50,580 --> 0:34:55,760
 got in problems so short show of hands who tried to use code from other people

650
0:34:55,760 --> 0:34:59,280
 because it sounded great at the beginning but then stopped doing because

651
0:34:59,280 --> 0:35:02,280
 yeah you couldn't you just couldn't

652
0:35:02,280 --> 0:35:08,520
 okay that's a lot more people so this is important factor and I want to talk

653
0:35:08,520 --> 0:35:13,800
 about this too not just about the license part and last checks the

654
0:35:13,800 --> 0:35:18,540
 requirements for your publication and release the software means have you done

655
0:35:18,540 --> 0:35:23,640
 everything which the license says and stuff like that and last publish the

656
0:35:23,640 --> 0:35:29,280
 software put it somewhere so

657
0:35:29,280 --> 0:35:30,280
 Oh I screwed something up

658
0:35:30,280 --> 0:35:31,780
 I screwed something up

659
0:35:32,280 --> 0:35:37,920
 now we talked about I mentioned you need to prepare your code and I brought

660
0:35:37,920 --> 0:35:42,040
 a list of minimal generic recommendations because in the end it

661
0:35:42,040 --> 0:35:49,500
 always depends on your your project what you need to do but this is like what I

662
0:35:49,500 --> 0:35:53,760
 think is kind of the minimum you should do for your project even if it's just a

663
0:35:53,760 --> 0:35:54,660
 small thing

664
0:35:54,660 --> 0:35:59,720
 this is based on something my colleagues and I wrote which is called a dealer

665
0:35:59,720 --> 0:36:02,280
 software engineering guidelines where you find a checklist

666
0:36:02,280 --> 0:36:09,840
 of things to do but this is like a generic wrap-up so the first thing

667
0:36:09,840 --> 0:36:14,220
 sounds really stupid but put your code under version control system and do this

668
0:36:14,220 --> 0:36:18,540
 from the start so people can understand what you did and put in good commit

669
0:36:18,540 --> 0:36:23,920
 codes use tax use release or stuff like that yeah it gives us talk to

670
0:36:23,920 --> 0:36:28,080
 researchers and they don't do this so this is why this is in there it sounds

671
0:36:28,080 --> 0:36:32,220
 like totally yeah that's the first thing all of us might do as a computer science

672
0:36:32,220 --> 0:36:36,220
 but researchers who write code and they sent her out tar files and stuff like

673
0:36:36,220 --> 0:36:44,700
 that then apply a basic coding style also something a lot of people think

674
0:36:44,700 --> 0:36:48,960
 they do but they don't probably do so use a linter get some help to get your

675
0:36:48,960 --> 0:36:56,220
 code clean up because it helps a lot to for reading and why go with the modular

676
0:36:56,220 --> 0:36:59,980
 design don't do over engineering this is a lot of computer scientists tend to do

677
0:36:59,980 --> 0:37:01,780
 they try to

678
0:37:01,780 --> 0:37:05,180
 create a solution which is extendable extendable extendable for everything you

679
0:37:05,180 --> 0:37:09,120
 could imagine and then nobody can use it

680
0:37:09,660 --> 0:37:14,160
 automation great thing to include especially to get a usable versions is

681
0:37:14,160 --> 0:37:24,180
 really helpful for your user if they can have one sorry and provides a sexual

682
0:37:24,180 --> 0:37:29,420
 documentation this is something which sounds also again like a really really

683
0:37:29,420 --> 0:37:31,560
 boring easy thing and everybody should do this

684
0:37:31,560 --> 0:37:31,760
 but

685
0:37:31,780 --> 0:37:36,600
 we checked on github and a lot of projects don't have a read me or read me

686
0:37:36,600 --> 0:37:40,560
 which is not really helpful and what a helpful read me looks like I'll show you

687
0:37:40,560 --> 0:37:49,560
 in a sec then again test your software assign a proper release number things

688
0:37:49,560 --> 0:37:56,780
 again basics not happening for a lot of projects and if you do public releases

689
0:37:56,780 --> 0:38:00,220
 oh here's something I wanted to take out it's sexy open source guidelines this is

690
0:38:00,220 --> 0:38:01,660
 kind of what I talked about do this

691
0:38:01,660 --> 0:38:06,900
 this whole process what you have to check for if you want to do a public

692
0:38:06,900 --> 0:38:12,220
 release and don't just use it internally but if we give it to others do this if

693
0:38:12,220 --> 0:38:17,260
 your code is probably and so others can use it in a legal way without getting in

694
0:38:17,260 --> 0:38:21,340
 trouble because a lot of code I want to reuse it's not properly licensed or they

695
0:38:21,340 --> 0:38:24,580
 didn't check their third-party licenses probably or they don't make it obvious

696
0:38:24,580 --> 0:38:29,420
 for me that they do it so I have a problem with that

697
0:38:29,420 --> 0:38:31,420
 so

698
0:38:31,420 --> 0:38:47,900
 then you have to go back to the

699
0:38:55,900 --> 0:39:00,420
 and I'll go back to the demo when I gave you the dependence and check all the

700
0:39:00,420 --> 0:39:02,020
 And then you have to pre-code in a way

701
0:39:02,020 --> 0:39:05,000
 that you add the license file to your repository,

702
0:39:05,000 --> 0:39:06,900
 that you add the license and copyright

703
0:39:06,900 --> 0:39:08,920
 hint to all your files.

704
0:39:08,920 --> 0:39:10,920
 A lot of people don't do that.

705
0:39:10,920 --> 0:39:14,040
 And document the third party dependencies.

706
0:39:14,040 --> 0:39:15,940
 So how does this look like?

707
0:39:15,940 --> 0:39:17,020
 You add a license file.

708
0:39:17,020 --> 0:39:20,860
 This is from the MIT license.

709
0:39:20,860 --> 0:39:23,820
 And yeah, again, I give this talk normally to researchers,

710
0:39:23,820 --> 0:39:25,440
 and they have really stupid ideas.

711
0:39:25,440 --> 0:39:27,840
 For example, they change the license text.

712
0:39:30,420 --> 0:39:35,260
 When you use something like MIT, you can't do that.

713
0:39:35,260 --> 0:39:37,420
 Then it's not MIT license anymore.

714
0:39:37,420 --> 0:39:40,060
 And you should keep the license as it is,

715
0:39:40,060 --> 0:39:42,740
 because people know how to deal with it, what it means.

716
0:39:42,740 --> 0:39:45,700
 If you change something, they have to read it.

717
0:39:45,700 --> 0:39:47,980
 So this is also a reason not to use your own license.

718
0:39:47,980 --> 0:39:50,220
 A lot of people love to use their own licenses.

719
0:39:50,220 --> 0:39:51,760
 I hate it, because I read the name.

720
0:39:51,760 --> 0:39:52,880
 I don't know what it is.

721
0:39:52,880 --> 0:39:54,420
 It means I have to read the license.

722
0:39:54,420 --> 0:39:55,900
 I have to understand it.

723
0:39:55,900 --> 0:39:57,900
 And I have to understand it correctly.

724
0:39:57,900 --> 0:39:59,740
 So please use an existence license.

725
0:39:59,740 --> 0:40:00,400
 Everybody knows.

726
0:40:00,400 --> 0:40:01,780
 It's about.

727
0:40:01,780 --> 0:40:03,400
 And the only thing you're allowed to adopt

728
0:40:03,400 --> 0:40:05,060
 is the copyright hint.

729
0:40:05,060 --> 0:40:06,400
 Again, this is a lot of people.

730
0:40:06,400 --> 0:40:08,240
 So they are really happy with, yeah, yeah, I know.

731
0:40:08,240 --> 0:40:09,640
 I'm not allowed to change anything.

732
0:40:09,640 --> 0:40:11,520
 And they don't change the copyright hint.

733
0:40:11,520 --> 0:40:14,520
 So this is something you have to adapt.

734
0:40:14,520 --> 0:40:16,120
 You really find a lot of licenses

735
0:40:16,120 --> 0:40:18,460
 where there's just a hashtag, like copyright holder.

736
0:40:18,460 --> 0:40:23,140
 And then it's like, great, close, nearly.

737
0:40:23,140 --> 0:40:25,500
 Please, this tiny thing do.

738
0:40:25,500 --> 0:40:28,320
 And then you can add the copyright hint license

739
0:40:28,320 --> 0:40:29,320
 into the source file.

740
0:40:29,320 --> 0:40:30,380
 And what do you see?

741
0:40:30,380 --> 0:40:33,520
 And a lot of code is that they copy the whole license

742
0:40:33,520 --> 0:40:37,240
 text, which is legally completely correct.

743
0:40:37,240 --> 0:40:38,620
 But it's really, really annoying,

744
0:40:38,620 --> 0:40:40,820
 because sometimes you have a really short file.

745
0:40:40,820 --> 0:40:44,520
 And three times the file content is the whole license.

746
0:40:44,520 --> 0:40:46,360
 And with MIT, we saw the whole license.

747
0:40:46,360 --> 0:40:47,500
 It's just OK.

748
0:40:47,500 --> 0:40:49,760
 But with GPL, it's pages and pages.

749
0:40:49,760 --> 0:40:50,980
 So this doesn't make sense.

750
0:40:50,980 --> 0:40:57,840
 So there's a new nice way to do this, which is called SPDX.

751
0:40:57,840 --> 0:40:59,920
 It's a copyright hint.

752
0:40:59,920 --> 0:41:03,260
 It's readable automatically, so machine-readable.

753
0:41:03,260 --> 0:41:06,880
 And you just put in your copyright text and a license

754
0:41:06,880 --> 0:41:08,220
 identifier.

755
0:41:08,220 --> 0:41:10,420
 And this is this.

756
0:41:10,420 --> 0:41:15,100
 And the license has to, so you put the whole license

757
0:41:15,100 --> 0:41:16,600
 test still in your project.

758
0:41:16,600 --> 0:41:19,440
 It's just stored in the licenses folder.

759
0:41:19,440 --> 0:41:23,440
 And it has exactly the tag you use here.

760
0:41:23,440 --> 0:41:26,800
 It's an MIT.txt file.

761
0:41:26,800 --> 0:41:29,800
 And so it matches automatically the tag to the file name.

762
0:41:29,920 --> 0:41:32,800
 So this is really nice.

763
0:41:32,800 --> 0:41:35,860
 It's something which was defined by the reuse software

764
0:41:35,860 --> 0:41:37,140
 initiative.

765
0:41:37,140 --> 0:41:39,080
 And they even have a small tool, which

766
0:41:39,080 --> 0:41:41,000
 will put all of this where you can enter, like,

767
0:41:41,000 --> 0:41:44,760
 I want this license, and for all of these file types, and so on.

768
0:41:44,760 --> 0:41:46,500
 And it will put it in all your code.

769
0:41:46,500 --> 0:41:50,700
 And if you have files which are not code files,

770
0:41:50,700 --> 0:41:52,500
 but for example, images or something,

771
0:41:52,500 --> 0:41:55,020
 you can also say, OK, do this.

772
0:41:55,020 --> 0:41:58,700
 And they will put a nice small file next to it, which it has

773
0:41:58,700 --> 0:41:59,720
 exactly the same file name.

774
0:41:59,720 --> 0:42:04,960
 Like the other one, like logo.png and then .license.

775
0:42:04,960 --> 0:42:08,060
 And in this is nothing except this copyright and license

776
0:42:08,060 --> 0:42:08,740
 hint.

777
0:42:08,740 --> 0:42:11,360
 And you can also use it for stuff like Creative Commons

778
0:42:11,360 --> 0:42:14,600
 or whatever to have everything perfectly labeled, which

779
0:42:14,600 --> 0:42:16,400
 is great, because everything which is not code

780
0:42:16,400 --> 0:42:18,020
 shouldn't be under open source licenses,

781
0:42:18,020 --> 0:42:21,800
 but use stuff like the Creative Commons licenses instead.

782
0:42:21,800 --> 0:42:23,700
 Because if you want to reuse stuff,

783
0:42:23,700 --> 0:42:27,440
 this is the only thing which makes really sense.

784
0:42:27,440 --> 0:42:29,020
 And this really helps you do this.

785
0:42:29,020 --> 0:42:31,320
 So they have a great site where they explain everything.

786
0:42:31,320 --> 0:42:34,380
 And there's this tool, which is really helpful.

787
0:42:34,380 --> 0:42:35,520
 And getting improved a lot.

788
0:42:38,140 --> 0:42:40,100
 Also important for your license stuff

789
0:42:40,100 --> 0:42:44,880
 is to document your dependencies.

790
0:42:44,880 --> 0:42:47,440
 You have to do it, you can, on the one hand,

791
0:42:47,440 --> 0:42:49,840
 you have often, like for a Python requirement,

792
0:42:49,840 --> 0:42:52,580
 TXT where you can write your license.

793
0:42:52,580 --> 0:42:55,360
 Important is the dependencies you have.

794
0:42:55,360 --> 0:42:59,000
 Important is that you list also which version you're using, as

795
0:42:59,020 --> 0:43:01,840
 well as under which license they use.

796
0:43:01,840 --> 0:43:05,840
 Here's the license information are in the readme file itself.

797
0:43:05,840 --> 0:43:07,480
 So it's written in brackets.

798
0:43:07,480 --> 0:43:09,760
 It's like BSD3 clause and something.

799
0:43:09,760 --> 0:43:12,560
 And because you don't provide it in this project where

800
0:43:12,560 --> 0:43:15,760
 we have this from, we don't provide the libraries

801
0:43:15,760 --> 0:43:16,420
 ourselves.

802
0:43:16,420 --> 0:43:19,060
 We say you get it via pip or something.

803
0:43:19,060 --> 0:43:21,520
 We don't have to ship their license files.

804
0:43:21,520 --> 0:43:23,520
 If you create an executable and ship it,

805
0:43:23,520 --> 0:43:27,140
 you have to get all these license files from them.

806
0:43:27,140 --> 0:43:29,000
 And my suggestion is, or if you're going to do this,

807
0:43:29,000 --> 0:43:32,140
 it's quite important to really copy it from their project

808
0:43:32,140 --> 0:43:34,600
 and not reuse, even if there's like you have 10 libraries

809
0:43:34,600 --> 0:43:37,340
 who are all on a MIT, copy of all of them

810
0:43:37,340 --> 0:43:39,340
 because they have different copyright hints

811
0:43:39,340 --> 0:43:41,620
 and they might have further information or whatever

812
0:43:41,620 --> 0:43:45,500
 in these files and say you have to take their files.

813
0:43:45,500 --> 0:43:49,380
 Also, it's not enough to make a link or something.

814
0:43:50,880 --> 0:43:55,200
 So yeah, and regarding the version, licenses may change

815
0:43:55,200 --> 0:43:56,880
 from one version to another.

816
0:43:56,880 --> 0:43:58,700
 PySite was such an example.

817
0:43:59,000 --> 0:44:03,400
 And they went to a commercial license from an open source

818
0:44:03,400 --> 0:44:05,580
 license, so it's important that you state which version

819
0:44:05,580 --> 0:44:08,640
 you are using so it's clear you're using the license

820
0:44:08,640 --> 0:44:11,760
 of this version and not of a later version where they perhaps

821
0:44:11,760 --> 0:44:12,260
 changed it.

822
0:44:15,960 --> 0:44:18,480
 Yeah, this is just example.

823
0:44:18,480 --> 0:44:20,820
 Everything is cleaned up, stuff, stuff, stuff, stuff, stuff.

824
0:44:20,820 --> 0:44:23,640
 Sorry, I just have one minute, so I have to go quickly through it.

825
0:44:23,640 --> 0:44:26,320
 But I kind of explained that already,

826
0:44:26,320 --> 0:44:28,720
 that you should clean up your code and stuff.

827
0:44:28,720 --> 0:44:29,900
 This can look like this.

828
0:44:29,900 --> 0:44:33,460
 Use releases, use tags, especially with GitLab,

829
0:44:33,460 --> 0:44:35,820
 it's nice, quite easily.

830
0:44:35,820 --> 0:44:37,000
 Have a good documentation.

831
0:44:37,000 --> 0:44:38,440
 A README is great.

832
0:44:38,440 --> 0:44:42,340
 A README should create or have the following sections.

833
0:44:42,340 --> 0:44:45,100
 A software purpose, again, sounds really basic.

834
0:44:45,100 --> 0:44:48,140
 It's missing off nearly all readments I stumble across,

835
0:44:48,140 --> 0:44:51,060
 like what is it, for whom, and why have you written it?

836
0:44:51,060 --> 0:44:53,380
 For example, this is just a small proof of concept.

837
0:44:53,380 --> 0:44:55,940
 It's important information for somebody who's using it

838
0:44:55,940 --> 0:44:58,320
 or this is a project we're using live in a big production

839
0:44:58,320 --> 0:45:00,780
 facility or whatever.

840
0:45:00,780 --> 0:45:02,160
 Talk about the main features.

841
0:45:02,160 --> 0:45:04,320
 Talk about restraints, like this is just

842
0:45:04,320 --> 0:45:07,820
 tested with Python 3.4 and Windows or something.

843
0:45:07,820 --> 0:45:11,760
 And make sure that you explain how to install it,

844
0:45:11,760 --> 0:45:15,000
 how to use it, and also perhaps give a rough idea

845
0:45:15,000 --> 0:45:18,720
 about future plans and ideas, that people know where you're

846
0:45:18,720 --> 0:45:22,020
 going with this, so if it makes sense for them to get included

847
0:45:22,020 --> 0:45:24,320
 or is this going perhaps in the direction they don't plan

848
0:45:24,320 --> 0:45:25,000
 or didn't expect.

849
0:45:25,000 --> 0:45:26,500
 If you're interested to get more information about this,

850
0:45:26,500 --> 0:45:27,700
 you can click on the link in the chat box.

851
0:45:27,700 --> 0:45:29,440
 And if you're interested to get a little bit more detail

852
0:45:29,440 --> 0:45:32,900
 how this looks like, I will perhaps later provide this slide

853
0:45:32,900 --> 0:45:35,520
 so there's a workshop we give which is just

854
0:45:35,520 --> 0:45:39,000
 about make your code ready for publication.

855
0:45:39,000 --> 0:45:43,140
 So in the end, the list of recommendations I want

856
0:45:43,140 --> 0:45:47,740
 to give you is to know who has exploitation rights.

857
0:45:47,740 --> 0:45:49,460
 Ah, that's a word I was missing in the beginning,

858
0:45:49,460 --> 0:45:50,300
 the exploitation rights.

859
0:45:50,300 --> 0:45:52,420
 Great. On my last slide, I have it.

860
0:45:52,420 --> 0:45:54,460
 So you have the ownership rights.

861
0:45:54,460 --> 0:45:57,700
 You might have the exploitation rights if it's your code,

862
0:45:57,700 --> 0:46:00,700
 if you worked it, created it while you worked for a company,

863
0:46:00,700 --> 0:46:05,020
 they have it, talk to those people.

864
0:46:05,020 --> 0:46:08,840
 If you accept external contributions, either be aware

865
0:46:08,840 --> 0:46:12,300
 that you have then other people who have exploitation rights.

866
0:46:12,300 --> 0:46:15,980
 You can create a contributor license agreement

867
0:46:15,980 --> 0:46:20,360
 where they handed their exploitation rights to you,

868
0:46:20,360 --> 0:46:23,020
 or you ensure you select the right license

869
0:46:23,020 --> 0:46:25,260
 on the very beginning because changing the license is

870
0:46:25,260 --> 0:46:27,460
 really hard if you don't have all the rights

871
0:46:27,460 --> 0:46:30,400
 because you have to ask everybody and they might disappear

872
0:46:30,400 --> 0:46:34,560
 and then you have to check like in and try to find them.

873
0:46:34,560 --> 0:46:37,220
 And we once had to find somebody who went somewhere

874
0:46:37,220 --> 0:46:41,660
 to South America to live in the jungle and we failed.

875
0:46:41,660 --> 0:46:44,360
 So we couldn't relicense.

876
0:46:44,360 --> 0:46:49,780
 When using third party code, check the license early.

877
0:46:49,780 --> 0:46:53,360
 If you want to have the possibility to go commercial

878
0:46:53,360 --> 0:46:57,460
 or use a permissive license, avoid GPL or be careful

879
0:46:57,460 --> 0:47:00,000
 when you introduce it.

880
0:47:00,000 --> 0:47:02,060
 Think about license compatibility.

881
0:47:02,060 --> 0:47:05,980
 Don't get different code which then doesn't work together.

882
0:47:05,980 --> 0:47:09,480
 And for the love of God, use a standard OS license.

883
0:47:09,480 --> 0:47:12,140
 I can understand quickly and I don't want to read your license

884
0:47:12,140 --> 0:47:14,360
 because, yeah, it's not fun.

885
0:47:14,360 --> 0:47:17,240
 And make your code usable for others, make it clean,

886
0:47:17,240 --> 0:47:19,480
 make it understandable, documented,

887
0:47:19,480 --> 0:47:21,760
 given instructions, all of this,

888
0:47:21,760 --> 0:47:25,160
 so others don't get frustrated by using it.

889
0:47:25,160 --> 0:47:27,440
 And while all of this makes,

890
0:47:27,460 --> 0:47:30,520
 sound publishing something as open source software

891
0:47:30,520 --> 0:47:33,100
 perhaps a little bit scary and a lot of effort,

892
0:47:33,100 --> 0:47:35,780
 it doesn't get better when you do it in a proprietary license

893
0:47:35,780 --> 0:47:38,300
 because you have to do all the same things.

894
0:47:38,300 --> 0:47:40,080
 But you have to think about your own license

895
0:47:40,080 --> 0:47:43,720
 and that nobody else is going with your stuff

896
0:47:43,720 --> 0:47:46,240
 and how you give support and stuff like this

897
0:47:46,240 --> 0:47:48,480
 because then people expect a little bit more.

898
0:47:48,480 --> 0:47:51,880
 So it's all of this and more work.

899
0:47:51,880 --> 0:47:53,560
 And with this, I'm on the end.

900
0:47:53,560 --> 0:47:55,120
 Thank you very much.

901
0:47:55,120 --> 0:47:57,260
 And if you have, perhaps you have some time

902
0:47:57,260 --> 0:47:58,760
 for questions, I...

903
0:47:58,760 --> 0:48:00,300
 We got five minutes for questions.

904
0:48:00,300 --> 0:48:01,140
 Yes.

905
0:48:09,660 --> 0:48:10,500
 Dr. Totsit.

906
0:48:11,500 --> 0:48:12,820
 Oh, thank you.

907
0:48:12,820 --> 0:48:16,640
 So I have one question about public domain licensing

908
0:48:16,640 --> 0:48:19,260
 and then one about dual licensing.

909
0:48:19,260 --> 0:48:21,620
 So I read an article at some point a while ago

910
0:48:21,620 --> 0:48:25,160
 that said that public domain sounds

911
0:48:25,160 --> 0:48:26,300
 like the most liberal thing,

912
0:48:26,300 --> 0:48:27,140
 but it's not,

913
0:48:27,260 --> 0:48:29,900
 it's just a part of the world.

914
0:48:29,900 --> 0:48:32,620
 And I was wondering if that's the same in all other places.

915
0:48:32,620 --> 0:48:34,480
 Exactly, public domain,

916
0:48:34,480 --> 0:48:37,260
 so perhaps, because the mic was a bit off,

917
0:48:37,260 --> 0:48:39,320
 I'll repeat really quick, public domain,

918
0:48:40,280 --> 0:48:42,340
 if it's really the most freedom thing

919
0:48:42,340 --> 0:48:44,500
 or it's not really acknowledged everywhere

920
0:48:44,500 --> 0:48:47,340
 and that's exactly the problem in Germany, for example,

921
0:48:47,340 --> 0:48:50,660
 it doesn't work because you have the ,

922
0:48:50,660 --> 0:48:52,440
 which means, so public domains means

923
0:48:52,440 --> 0:48:54,300
 you give away all your rights.

924
0:48:54,300 --> 0:48:56,260
 So you say here, this is the community,

925
0:48:56,260 --> 0:48:57,280
 I don't have anything to do.

926
0:48:57,280 --> 0:49:00,300
 You kind of cut yourself off of it.

927
0:49:00,300 --> 0:49:01,520
 In Germany, that doesn't work

928
0:49:01,520 --> 0:49:02,480
 because you have the Urheberrecht.

929
0:49:02,480 --> 0:49:04,340
 You always have the ownership.

930
0:49:04,340 --> 0:49:05,620
 You can't do this.

931
0:49:05,620 --> 0:49:07,320
 So legally, in the US, this works.

932
0:49:07,320 --> 0:49:08,540
 In Germany, not.

933
0:49:08,540 --> 0:49:10,260
 So you could say it's not valuable.

934
0:49:10,260 --> 0:49:13,480
 So it's kind of no license.

935
0:49:13,480 --> 0:49:17,580
 But before, if you talk with a lawyer

936
0:49:17,580 --> 0:49:20,060
 or a judge or whatever, they would say

937
0:49:20,060 --> 0:49:22,980
 it shows that the intention was given

938
0:49:22,980 --> 0:49:25,940
 that it's public domain, that you can do whatever.

939
0:49:25,940 --> 0:49:27,940
 So if somebody then would say,

940
0:49:27,940 --> 0:49:30,560
 so you use public domain in Germany or whatever.

941
0:49:30,560 --> 0:49:32,420
 And so then the owner comes and says,

942
0:49:32,420 --> 0:49:34,220
 oh, I still have the ownership in Germany,

943
0:49:34,220 --> 0:49:36,700
 so I can sue you because you used it in a way.

944
0:49:37,700 --> 0:49:39,140
 And because public domain is not

945
0:49:39,140 --> 0:49:41,440
 a legal construct in Germany,

946
0:49:41,440 --> 0:49:43,660
 the lawyer, the judge might perhaps say,

947
0:49:43,660 --> 0:49:47,560
 yeah, but you really made clear your intention.

948
0:49:47,560 --> 0:49:50,080
 So it's a bit tricky.

949
0:49:50,080 --> 0:49:51,940
 Also, for example, with public domain,

950
0:49:51,940 --> 0:49:55,060
 you don't have to state that it's public domain

951
0:49:55,060 --> 0:49:55,900
 or something because you don't have

952
0:49:55,900 --> 0:49:57,760
 to give any contribution.

953
0:49:57,760 --> 0:49:59,400
 I always, if I use public domain,

954
0:49:59,400 --> 0:50:01,740
 write in that it's public domain and where I got it,

955
0:50:01,740 --> 0:50:03,500
 so I'm still giving contribution

956
0:50:03,500 --> 0:50:05,020
 because I want to make it visible

957
0:50:05,020 --> 0:50:07,200
 for others that I took care of that.

958
0:50:07,200 --> 0:50:08,860
 So I think you can use it.

959
0:50:11,280 --> 0:50:13,940
 Because, yeah, normally in the end,

960
0:50:13,940 --> 0:50:18,080
 legally it's not really clean, but it should work out.

961
0:50:18,080 --> 0:50:20,080
 And now I forgot your second question.

962
0:50:20,080 --> 0:50:21,420
 Oh, dual licenses.

963
0:50:22,340 --> 0:50:25,020
 So dual licensing is normally something you do,

964
0:50:25,020 --> 0:50:26,820
 like you use one copyleft license

965
0:50:26,820 --> 0:50:30,300
 and you use a commercial, that's the normal combination.

966
0:50:31,320 --> 0:50:35,000
 This means, for example, you put something under GPL

967
0:50:35,000 --> 0:50:39,120
 and somebody can, so everybody can use it

968
0:50:39,120 --> 0:50:40,980
 who's happy with using GPL,

969
0:50:40,980 --> 0:50:43,980
 but if you want to put it in your commercial project,

970
0:50:43,980 --> 0:50:45,620
 you have to go and pay.

971
0:50:45,620 --> 0:50:46,980
 So that's the idea behind it.

972
0:50:48,260 --> 0:50:50,160
 So you pay then for a commercial license

973
0:50:50,160 --> 0:50:53,820
 and this is allowed to do because the owner can decide that,

974
0:50:53,820 --> 0:50:54,860
 like, this version, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know,

975
0:50:54,860 --> 0:50:55,700
 I don't know.

976
0:50:55,700 --> 0:50:56,520
 I don't know.

977
0:50:56,520 --> 0:50:57,600
 So I can take this version I built like this executable

978
0:50:57,600 --> 0:50:58,440
 because I have all the rights.

979
0:50:58,440 --> 0:51:00,820
 If I have all the rights, I can say, this is GPL

980
0:51:00,820 --> 0:51:02,400
 and I can take this other one and say,

981
0:51:02,400 --> 0:51:03,480
 this is a commercial one.

982
0:51:03,480 --> 0:51:04,300
 I can do this.

983
0:51:04,300 --> 0:51:05,760
 They are like two entities.

984
0:51:08,240 --> 0:51:11,180
 Yeah, so as an owner, I can do this.

985
0:51:11,180 --> 0:51:12,940
 I don't recommend it really a lot,

986
0:51:12,940 --> 0:51:15,440
 but it's done by some companies to get,

987
0:51:15,440 --> 0:51:17,800
 yeah, like a big community to use it

988
0:51:17,800 --> 0:51:21,440
 and perhaps even give code back and improve it and stuff

989
0:51:21,440 --> 0:51:24,120
 and on the other hand, still do a commercialization.

990
0:51:24,860 --> 0:51:38,840
 a question or oh okay yeah this exists to like several the audience so for

991
0:51:38,840 --> 0:51:44,120
 example if you have GPL and BSD and MIT simply to just say I don't really know

992
0:51:44,120 --> 0:51:48,100
 what the sum of this is I just want to make it the most easy for everyone to

993
0:51:48,100 --> 0:51:52,700
 adapt on their terms is that an option and is that possibly like what you're

994
0:51:52,700 --> 0:51:56,660
 aiming for with the public domain but more digestible for anyone who cares

995
0:51:56,660 --> 0:52:01,600
 about licenses yes so there's some licenses who do stuff like this so

996
0:52:01,600 --> 0:52:06,260
 there's like GPL 3 and newer or whatever so you have all this family you don't

997
0:52:06,260 --> 0:52:10,400
 have to relicense but there's also some who you can say oh this is MIT and BSD

998
0:52:10,400 --> 0:52:17,480
 or whatever to give people the prob as a possibility to not run into license

999
0:52:17,480 --> 0:52:21,940
 compatibility issues so this exists people do is this then it's really

1000
0:52:21,940 --> 0:52:22,680
 important that you

1001
0:52:22,680 --> 0:52:26,440
 state in your project when you use it under which license you're using it

1002
0:52:26,440 --> 0:52:32,500
 because for the next user and stuff can this can be relevant this is done by

1003
0:52:32,500 --> 0:52:37,160
 some people but it get can get complicated regarding third-party you

1004
0:52:37,160 --> 0:52:42,540
 use and also because of the staff which is sometimes written in the licenses so

1005
0:52:42,540 --> 0:52:47,760
 it depends some you can combine really well some you can't because some say you

1006
0:52:47,760 --> 0:52:52,640
 have to do this and that and yeah so it's a bit

1007
0:52:52,680 --> 0:52:57,980
 it depends because they have what's the licenses say some you can combine and

1008
0:52:57,980 --> 0:53:02,240
 you can do this as it your licensing or parallel licensing with others you can't

1009
0:53:02,240 --> 0:53:06,680
 but it means a lot of effort because for all of those you have to have a special

1010
0:53:06,680 --> 0:53:11,580
 like then CI build or something which provides for example the license tag in

1011
0:53:11,580 --> 0:53:15,900
 each file and normally you should have in git or something a lot of this

1012
0:53:15,900 --> 0:53:19,500
 licenses say you have to have it in the file already not just when you create

1013
0:53:19,500 --> 0:53:22,480
 the executable

1014
0:53:22,680 --> 0:53:28,440
 you would have to have yeah your own license which include all these possibilities or whatever and so

1015
0:53:28,440 --> 0:53:34,200
 it gets complicated really quickly again because yeah you have to have one copy of your code you

1016
0:53:34,200 --> 0:53:38,360
 would say with different license tags for every separate license that's why not a lot of people

1017
0:53:38,360 --> 0:53:47,320
 do it because it's a lot of effort to stay all of this in sync one quick last question yeah do you

1018
0:53:47,320 --> 0:53:54,680
 know any sanity check in either gitlab or github that will verify if you're using gpl when you're

1019
0:53:54,680 --> 0:54:00,760
 trying to do mit so if you track something as mit and you have everything including libraries that

1020
0:54:00,760 --> 0:54:05,480
 is gpl would is there anything in either gitlab or github that will warn you you're doing something

1021
0:54:05,480 --> 0:54:10,680
 that's not compatible or is there an open source project that will check your open source project

1022
0:54:11,800 --> 0:54:17,240
 so um there's tools which check this and

1023
0:54:17,240 --> 0:54:17,320
 i

1024
0:54:17,320 --> 0:54:21,400
 open source the really good ones so there's one open source which is okay it's the really good

1025
0:54:21,400 --> 0:54:26,280
 ones which will do all those legal things they will check and they will create the lists and

1026
0:54:26,280 --> 0:54:32,920
 everything they cost around six figures so the good tools are really expensive because

1027
0:54:32,920 --> 0:54:38,680
 this is a lot of effort and there's a lot of manual effort behind it um so not really

1028
0:54:39,640 --> 0:54:43,800
 there's some tools who will at least check like who are all the licenses you have

1029
0:54:43,800 --> 0:54:47,240
 um other fights which don't have a license header so you have to check for that

1030
0:54:47,240 --> 0:54:54,440
 why can't somebody verify for that and this is the list of licenses you have in there and you

1031
0:54:54,440 --> 0:54:58,600
 can have a first glance over it and they will try to give you some info and warnings and stuff but

1032
0:54:58,600 --> 0:55:05,240
 it's not that they do everything for you um i forgot to be honest which the name was from the

1033
0:55:05,240 --> 0:55:11,240
 one open source tool it looks like really from the 90s or something i can look it up um if you if you

1034
0:55:11,240 --> 0:55:17,080
 find me later what the name was and yeah part of it no in gitlab github there's nothing yet really

1035
0:55:17,080 --> 0:55:17,980
 would be great.

1036
0:55:19,320 --> 0:55:20,360
 Thank you very much.
