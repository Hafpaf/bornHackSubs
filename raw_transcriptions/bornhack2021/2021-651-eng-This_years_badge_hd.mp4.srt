0:00:00,000 --> 0:00:12,600
 I would like to welcome Flummer, who is going to speak about this year's batch.

2
0:00:12,600 --> 0:00:13,600
 You go ahead.

3
0:00:13,600 --> 0:00:16,680
 Thank you very much.

4
0:00:16,680 --> 0:00:21,560
 So yeah, this year we actually managed to have batches ready for check-in.

5
0:00:21,560 --> 0:00:27,560
 So I guess most of you already have the batch.

6
0:00:27,560 --> 0:00:33,960
 In the next little time, we'll go through some of the thoughts behind the decisions

7
0:00:33,960 --> 0:00:41,140
 that we made about batches this year, and then explain a little on what's on the batch,

8
0:00:41,140 --> 0:00:47,420
 and what can be added to the batch, and also how to add stuff to the batch.

9
0:00:47,420 --> 0:00:55,820
 Little ideas, and finish off with ways of integrating with existing batches if you

10
0:00:55,820 --> 0:00:57,540
 have one from a previous year.

11
0:00:57,540 --> 0:01:03,140
 And then the last thing is a little competition, so to get people started and sort of motivate.

12
0:01:03,140 --> 0:01:08,140
 So do a little thing and see if you can manage to hack something.

13
0:01:08,140 --> 0:01:13,140
 We have a little competition.

14
0:01:13,140 --> 0:01:25,780
 So the past year and a half, especially last year, electronics sort of supply chain has

15
0:01:25,780 --> 0:01:27,100
 had some issues.

16
0:01:27,540 --> 0:01:34,780
 Some companies thought that when Corona hit, they wouldn't sell anything, so they canceled

17
0:01:34,780 --> 0:01:37,180
 their pre-orders.

18
0:01:37,180 --> 0:01:41,160
 But people still wanted cars because people didn't want to sit in buses.

19
0:01:41,160 --> 0:01:47,400
 So when the car industry figured out and then found out that people still want to buy cars,

20
0:01:47,400 --> 0:01:49,820
 they kind of want their parts back.

21
0:01:49,820 --> 0:01:55,540
 But the whole supply chain had said, yeah, we already sold that slot to somebody else,

22
0:01:55,540 --> 0:01:56,140
 because the whole graphic card system.

23
0:01:56,140 --> 0:01:56,240
 Yeah.

24
0:01:56,240 --> 0:01:56,540
 Yeah.

25
0:01:56,540 --> 0:01:56,840
 Yeah.

26
0:01:56,840 --> 0:01:57,140
 Yeah.

27
0:01:57,140 --> 0:01:57,340
 Yeah.

28
0:01:57,340 --> 0:01:57,440
 Yeah.

29
0:01:57,440 --> 0:01:57,540
 Yeah.

30
0:01:57,540 --> 0:01:58,040
 Yeah.

31
0:01:58,040 --> 0:02:01,120
 And obviously, the parts business and Bitcoin mining and people working from home need the

32
0:02:01,120 --> 0:02:02,680
 extra graphic card.

33
0:02:02,680 --> 0:02:04,240
 They needed the extra capacity.

34
0:02:04,240 --> 0:02:11,840
 So stuff didn't sort of work out as the auto industry had hoped.

35
0:02:11,840 --> 0:02:13,960
 And that has sort of trickled out.

36
0:02:13,960 --> 0:02:19,320
 And right now, we are in a state where some parts you can easily get, you can just buy

37
0:02:19,320 --> 0:02:25,840
 them as you normally could, but other parts, especially ones are sort of silicon and some

38
0:02:25,840 --> 0:02:26,840
 more advanced stuff.

39
0:02:26,840 --> 0:02:32,840
 some simple like voltage regulators that everybody needs them but but they still

40
0:02:32,840 --> 0:02:36,560
 need to be manufactured a little bit more sort of advanced than the very

41
0:02:36,560 --> 0:02:43,300
 simple parts those parts are sort of just not able to you can't get them

42
0:02:43,300 --> 0:02:48,680
 especially parts that are little sort of have a very specific feature they they

43
0:02:48,680 --> 0:02:54,860
 are like the screenshot here that's I took it like earlier today this is not

44
0:02:54,860 --> 0:02:59,600
 that bad it's only half a year out you can get the parts but normally they had

45
0:02:59,600 --> 0:03:04,340
 like 47 like 47 weekly time that means when you order them that it'll be 47

46
0:03:04,340 --> 0:03:11,420
 weeks until you get them for large-scale production where you plan ahead might be

47
0:03:11,420 --> 0:03:18,800
 okay normally it's in the five maybe 20 weeks but for a little batch project

48
0:03:18,800 --> 0:03:24,140
 that we do we usually sort of rely on the distributors just having stock that

49
0:03:24,140 --> 0:03:24,840
 we can get them like that and then we can get the parts that we need to get

50
0:03:24,840 --> 0:03:34,500
 like day to day almost um so with this little sort of uncertainty uh we decided

51
0:03:34,500 --> 0:03:39,900
 this spring uh that's making a patch that had a bunch of these parts that are somewhat

52
0:03:39,900 --> 0:03:47,580
 difficult to get um would be a challenge where it's not fun to have a badge like two weeks after

53
0:03:47,580 --> 0:03:54,780
 born hack um so so we ended up even though I had more or less a design for a batch and making one

54
0:03:54,840 --> 0:04:00,660
 from parts in the way in my little workshop that I can do that but if we need like several hundred

55
0:04:00,660 --> 0:04:09,000
 of them um this whole production setup is it needs to be sort of used and and if that is somewhat

56
0:04:09,000 --> 0:04:16,680
 flaky the risk of not having a badge is very high the previous years this has been just like the

57
0:04:16,680 --> 0:04:22,980
 first or second day of born hack they are done um if we're pushing that just a few days it breaks down

58
0:04:24,840 --> 0:04:32,940
 um years batch is something very different um it's a batch that focuses much more on the

59
0:04:32,940 --> 0:04:43,020
 electronic side than the previous year's patches um it's simple um but what you want to make of

60
0:04:43,020 --> 0:04:48,900
 it you can sort of choose yourself a little bit um the batch has a bunch of prototyping area

61
0:04:48,900 --> 0:04:54,780
 that's little holes and the little pads that that sits on the on the front of the badge the holes

62
0:04:54,840 --> 0:05:02,220
 are spaced in a distance that is very common for many little sort of through hole parts where you

63
0:05:02,220 --> 0:05:09,060
 put the pins through the holes and then you sort of them on the back side where the the pads without

64
0:05:09,060 --> 0:05:15,360
 the holes little square ones those are for the surface mount components and the spacing are also

65
0:05:16,020 --> 0:05:24,240
 useful for the for for the slightly larger parts um so it though the the shape of the pads and the

66
0:05:24,240 --> 0:05:24,780
 placing will help

67
0:05:24,840 --> 0:05:31,680
 in soldering them um you don't have to solder SMD parts but having a little practice I think it's

68
0:05:31,680 --> 0:05:39,240
 a good thing if you want to fix uh your electronics stuff does break down and often you can fix it and

69
0:05:39,240 --> 0:05:47,400
 every type of electronics you have today will be SMD surface mounted devices um so the badge also

70
0:05:47,400 --> 0:05:53,580
 has the connector um it's a similar collector connector as the um connect the footprint similar

71
0:05:53,580 --> 0:05:54,480
 to the previous years

72
0:05:54,840 --> 0:05:59,940
 uh but for this patch you can actually decide whether you want the batch as

73
0:06:00,600 --> 0:06:06,780
 uh a batch that has maybe power and then you can power other add-ons or you can use this batch as

74
0:06:06,780 --> 0:06:11,580
 an add-on by putting the connector on the back side instead um and then you can have it as add-on

75
0:06:11,580 --> 0:06:17,820
 to previous years batches if you want for instance to to get started coding and that's sort of what

76
0:06:17,820 --> 0:06:22,920
 you want then you can make this into an add-on and then make some LEDs or temp sensor or something on

77
0:06:22,920 --> 0:06:24,720
 this and then you can do the coding on the

78
0:06:24,840 --> 0:06:32,040
 batch from the previous year the little uh that's a little connector called uh quick or stem acuity

79
0:06:32,040 --> 0:06:41,940
 that's a standard that uh spark fun and uh Adafruit has made it uses similar connectivity as the add-on

80
0:06:41,940 --> 0:06:48,120
 connector so that's also there'll be a slide also a little later also the I2C pins are sort

81
0:06:48,120 --> 0:06:54,000
 of broken out so it's easier if you want to add something from functionality both on the throughhole area

82
0:06:54,840 --> 0:06:59,940
 and markings on the back and then on the SMD area if you want to add a little temp sensor or something

83
0:07:01,380 --> 0:07:06,900
 you can also write your name on it if it's uh I guess that's the bare minimum of hacking your

84
0:07:06,900 --> 0:07:14,760
 batch it's just a writing name on with a sharpie the batch is open source so for us like the previous

85
0:07:14,760 --> 0:07:22,140
 years you can download the files their KiCad files there's also a schematic um the URLs on the batch

86
0:07:24,840 --> 0:07:31,200
 is PCB way so we got them to to make them and a nice glossy gold finish

87
0:07:35,340 --> 0:07:41,760
 so since these are very sort of hardware focused uh and people usually don't bring a lot of parts

88
0:07:42,540 --> 0:07:49,620
 uh I made a bunch of boxes with little containers in them with a lot of different parts it's not

89
0:07:49,620 --> 0:07:53,340
 everything because millions of parts exist but they are parts that are

90
0:07:53,340 --> 0:07:54,460
 Meats for higherØ¯

91
0:07:54,840 --> 0:07:56,980
 fairly easy to sort of get going with.

92
0:07:56,980 --> 0:08:00,520
 It's resistors, capacitors, some transistors

93
0:08:00,520 --> 0:08:02,300
 so you can make very simple circuits.

94
0:08:02,300 --> 0:08:03,800
 And there's a bunch of LEDs.

95
0:08:03,800 --> 0:08:06,140
 I have colored LEDs in, I think I have six,

96
0:08:06,140 --> 0:08:08,980
 seven different types, some of them with multiple colors

97
0:08:08,980 --> 0:08:09,980
 in the same one.

98
0:08:09,980 --> 0:08:11,620
 There's even LEDs that blink themselves

99
0:08:11,620 --> 0:08:13,160
 and you just need to power and then they

100
0:08:13,160 --> 0:08:14,940
 will do little flashy things.

101
0:08:14,940 --> 0:08:18,860
 So depending on what sort of type of hacking

102
0:08:18,860 --> 0:08:21,140
 you are interested in, you can start

103
0:08:21,140 --> 0:08:22,560
 get going with very simple things,

104
0:08:22,560 --> 0:08:24,300
 just add some sort of battery holder.

105
0:08:24,300 --> 0:08:26,520
 I have three different types.

106
0:08:26,520 --> 0:08:28,640
 Then maybe a little bit of wire and then an LED

107
0:08:28,640 --> 0:08:31,060
 and then you have something that will blink in the bar.

108
0:08:35,360 --> 0:08:37,040
 We have a hardware hacking area.

109
0:08:37,040 --> 0:08:41,040
 It's the big white tent in the middle of the general camping.

110
0:08:41,040 --> 0:08:42,980
 Up there, there are sawing irons,

111
0:08:42,980 --> 0:08:46,000
 there are extra lights for detail work.

112
0:08:46,000 --> 0:08:48,340
 There are these boxes with parts and you're welcome

113
0:08:48,340 --> 0:08:50,480
 to grab parts and add to your batch.

114
0:08:50,480 --> 0:08:52,500
 It's of course not meant to grab the whole box

115
0:08:52,500 --> 0:08:54,280
 but taking it out.

116
0:08:54,300 --> 0:08:56,120
 But if you're taking individual parts and hanging them on

117
0:08:56,120 --> 0:08:58,060
 and putting it on and making something,

118
0:08:58,060 --> 0:08:59,300
 that's what they're for.

119
0:08:59,300 --> 0:09:00,520
 So feel free.

120
0:09:00,520 --> 0:09:04,920
 There are also some microcontroller stuff.

121
0:09:04,920 --> 0:09:06,740
 It's mostly MSP430s.

122
0:09:06,740 --> 0:09:11,440
 They are very easy to get going, three volts, no problem.

123
0:09:11,440 --> 0:09:14,660
 I also have some programmers for the different types

124
0:09:14,660 --> 0:09:17,400
 of microcontrollers that are there.

125
0:09:17,400 --> 0:09:23,440
 Come get me and we can figure out how to program these chips.

126
0:09:23,440 --> 0:09:25,540
 The whole microcontroller thing is for people

127
0:09:25,540 --> 0:09:27,380
 who maybe have a little experience

128
0:09:27,380 --> 0:09:30,000
 because they are very, it's just the chip

129
0:09:30,000 --> 0:09:32,000
 and some capacitors and then you have

130
0:09:32,000 --> 0:09:33,420
 to do everything yourself.

131
0:09:34,540 --> 0:09:37,200
 But if you want to do that, that's definitely an option.

132
0:09:38,160 --> 0:09:41,160
 There are even some with Wi-Fi on the little breakout board.

133
0:09:43,680 --> 0:09:46,520
 Some ideas like blinking LEDs,

134
0:09:46,520 --> 0:09:48,920
 definitely have some flashy for the bar.

135
0:09:49,980 --> 0:09:53,260
 There are also a little buzzer or some jacks for headphones

136
0:09:53,260 --> 0:09:57,400
 if you want to make some audio thing maybe playing with that.

137
0:09:57,400 --> 0:10:01,580
 With a few transistors, two capacitors, and some resistors,

138
0:10:01,580 --> 0:10:02,920
 you can actually make audio.

139
0:10:02,920 --> 0:10:05,700
 You can make sounds in different frequencies.

140
0:10:05,700 --> 0:10:10,280
 So playing with that could be an interesting idea for.

141
0:10:10,280 --> 0:10:12,160
 Also, we have some vibration sensors,

142
0:10:12,160 --> 0:10:15,000
 maybe like an alarm system where if you touch the badge,

143
0:10:15,000 --> 0:10:16,580
 then it'll trigger a little LED and you

144
0:10:16,580 --> 0:10:17,840
 can see somebody has touched your badge.

145
0:10:17,840 --> 0:10:20,320
 You can put it on top of your laptop, have an alarm there.

146
0:10:20,320 --> 0:10:22,440
 Also, of course, there's a lot of stuff

147
0:10:22,440 --> 0:10:23,160
 that you can do.

148
0:10:23,160 --> 0:10:28,160
 So a vibration motor, maybe some identifier or alert stuff,

149
0:10:28,260 --> 0:10:30,700
 maybe combining with another badge.

150
0:10:30,700 --> 0:10:33,640
 And then, of course, the microcontrollers.

151
0:10:33,640 --> 0:10:35,460
 I also have some temp sensors.

152
0:10:35,460 --> 0:10:38,300
 These are, the temp sensors are surface mounts

153
0:10:38,300 --> 0:10:41,240
 and they require a little practice maybe.

154
0:10:42,500 --> 0:10:45,380
 But we will hang out in the hardware hacking area

155
0:10:45,380 --> 0:10:46,420
 and be able to help.

156
0:10:46,420 --> 0:10:49,520
 So if people want to learn to solder for the first time,

157
0:10:49,520 --> 0:10:50,700
 I'll be happy to help.

158
0:10:50,700 --> 0:10:52,600
 And there are also a bunch of other,

159
0:10:53,160 --> 0:10:55,080
 team members that will hang out there

160
0:10:55,080 --> 0:10:57,580
 and know how to solder and can teach people.

161
0:11:00,220 --> 0:11:03,120
 A little on the little, there's a connector on the edge

162
0:11:03,120 --> 0:11:04,580
 that, well, on the badge it's empty,

163
0:11:04,580 --> 0:11:06,120
 but you can add this little connector.

164
0:11:06,120 --> 0:11:08,000
 I also have these connectors.

165
0:11:08,000 --> 0:11:08,920
 It's for a standard.

166
0:11:08,920 --> 0:11:12,920
 I don't have the modules, but this standard

167
0:11:12,920 --> 0:11:16,960
 seems to be fairly popular.

168
0:11:16,960 --> 0:11:19,400
 Both SparkFun and Adafruit are using them

169
0:11:19,400 --> 0:11:21,800
 for a lot of different ports they have.

170
0:11:21,800 --> 0:11:23,000
 And I've seen people.

171
0:11:23,000 --> 0:11:26,160
 I've used these for getting prototypes very quickly.

172
0:11:27,520 --> 0:11:32,200
 And if you make the badge into an add-on for another badge,

173
0:11:32,200 --> 0:11:35,820
 the I2C signals are passed through out to this connector

174
0:11:35,820 --> 0:11:39,320
 so you can add sensors or buttons or whatever

175
0:11:40,360 --> 0:11:44,940
 in this sort of series of add-ons via this badge

176
0:11:44,940 --> 0:11:46,820
 on to other badges.

177
0:11:49,000 --> 0:11:51,000
 And also, yeah, I have all the connectors.

178
0:11:53,000 --> 0:11:57,480
 This is a little indication of how it will look

179
0:11:57,480 --> 0:12:00,920
 when you add the badge as an add-on.

180
0:12:02,200 --> 0:12:05,380
 Last year's badge didn't have the connector populated,

181
0:12:05,380 --> 0:12:07,220
 but there was a spot for it.

182
0:12:08,260 --> 0:12:11,040
 The connectors you can use for last year's badge,

183
0:12:11,040 --> 0:12:13,660
 those will also be in the hardware hacking area,

184
0:12:13,660 --> 0:12:16,060
 so if you want to add that to your badge.

185
0:12:20,880 --> 0:12:22,360
 And then to get people,

186
0:12:23,000 --> 0:12:26,840
 you can add a lot of different things to the badge.

187
0:12:26,840 --> 0:12:28,900
 So that's how it's going.

188
0:12:28,900 --> 0:12:31,260
 We have a bit of little merge things.

189
0:12:31,260 --> 0:12:34,020
 And I think for the first five people

190
0:12:34,020 --> 0:12:36,620
 who have something blinking on the badge,

191
0:12:36,620 --> 0:12:39,620
 the kids, for the kids it's okay to use the little LEDs

192
0:12:39,620 --> 0:12:41,420
 that blink themselves.

193
0:12:41,420 --> 0:12:43,300
 I think for everybody else,

194
0:12:43,300 --> 0:12:46,340
 something else should be controlling the LEDs.

195
0:12:47,760 --> 0:12:52,760
 How you do it, I'm open to pretty much anything.

196
0:12:53,000 --> 0:12:54,320
 You can use another badge,

197
0:12:54,320 --> 0:12:55,720
 but it should be a self-containing thing

198
0:12:55,720 --> 0:12:58,720
 that can hang around your neck and have batteries on there.

199
0:13:00,460 --> 0:13:02,600
 And if you use another badge,

200
0:13:02,600 --> 0:13:03,840
 you should use the connector.

201
0:13:03,840 --> 0:13:06,440
 You can't just do random wires.

202
0:13:08,880 --> 0:13:13,880
 But I think it's not that difficult.

203
0:13:14,000 --> 0:13:14,960
 It should be possible.

204
0:13:14,960 --> 0:13:19,960
 And for the first five that come and show a badge blinking,

205
0:13:20,080 --> 0:13:21,260
 that'll be a little gift,

206
0:13:21,260 --> 0:13:23,000
 one of the little badges that we got

207
0:13:23,000 --> 0:13:26,360
 from the sponsor, all these little rulers.

208
0:13:26,360 --> 0:13:27,240
 They're very handy.

209
0:13:27,240 --> 0:13:29,320
 They have all the little measurements

210
0:13:29,320 --> 0:13:31,540
 and the hole sizes and component sizes.

211
0:13:31,540 --> 0:13:32,780
 Very, very nifty.

212
0:13:36,240 --> 0:13:39,460
 So I would say, happy hacking.

213
0:13:40,660 --> 0:13:44,960
 And if there are questions, I'd love to answer.

214
0:13:44,960 --> 0:13:46,860
 Yeah, in the back.

215
0:13:49,920 --> 0:13:52,800
 That'll be a microphone, also for the stream.

216
0:13:53,000 --> 0:13:55,800
 We need the microphone.

217
0:14:05,400 --> 0:14:07,580
 In the central connector,

218
0:14:07,580 --> 0:14:09,400
 the six pin connector in the middle,

219
0:14:09,400 --> 0:14:12,580
 there is a pin called ground,

220
0:14:12,580 --> 0:14:14,460
 and ground is clearly connected

221
0:14:14,460 --> 0:14:18,500
 to the row of the breadboard called ground.

222
0:14:18,500 --> 0:14:20,720
 But there are only three wires going to the corner

223
0:14:20,720 --> 0:14:22,340
 that connects to the...

224
0:14:22,340 --> 0:14:28,980
 if I remember correctly, all the area in between the little holes are actually ground.

225
0:14:30,680 --> 0:14:36,600
 So there's like a flood of copper all the way around, and that is connected to ground.

226
0:14:39,080 --> 0:14:44,120
 I have a microscope up in the hardware hacking area, and we can go in and look.

227
0:14:44,360 --> 0:14:49,340
 So usually when you look very close to the little path, the round path,

228
0:14:49,340 --> 0:14:50,980
 there will be a little extra going out.

229
0:14:50,980 --> 0:14:56,360
 So the flood fill on the PCB, we can also open it up in KiCad,

230
0:14:56,500 --> 0:15:00,280
 and I can show you how the copper layers are on the batch.

231
0:15:00,860 --> 0:15:01,240
 All right.

232
0:15:02,880 --> 0:15:03,880
 Other questions?

233
0:15:13,880 --> 0:15:16,660
 Yeah, do you have any proximity sensors?

234
0:15:16,660 --> 0:15:20,420
 I have a few of these, yeah, Echo.

235
0:15:20,980 --> 0:15:24,960
 It's like little modules, but I have a few of those, actually, yeah.

236
0:15:25,200 --> 0:15:25,400
 Okay.

237
0:15:27,060 --> 0:15:27,340
 Other?

238
0:15:38,120 --> 0:15:42,740
 You said you didn't have any Stamak-QT modules, but do you have the wires for the Stamak-QT?

239
0:15:44,120 --> 0:15:47,280
 I think I can find one of two if you want to test stuff out.

240
0:15:47,280 --> 0:15:48,920
 I have a little collection of my own stuff.

241
0:15:50,340 --> 0:15:50,900
 Yeah.

242
0:15:50,980 --> 0:15:53,640
 Any other questions?

243
0:15:56,600 --> 0:15:57,080
 No?

244
0:15:57,420 --> 0:16:01,480
 Then let's give Flummer a hand, both for the talk and the work with the batch.

245
0:16:02,620 --> 0:16:03,260
 Thank you.
