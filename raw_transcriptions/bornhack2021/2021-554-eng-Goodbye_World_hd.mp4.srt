0:00:00,000 --> 0:00:08,240
 Hello, everybody.

2
0:00:08,840 --> 0:00:09,280
 Hello.

3
0:00:09,520 --> 0:00:09,740
 Hello.

4
0:00:12,680 --> 0:00:15,960
 Welcome to the final talk of BornHack 2021.

5
0:00:16,800 --> 0:00:19,980
 We have had quite a week,

6
0:00:20,380 --> 0:00:25,760
 and it's gone much faster than it always does.

7
0:00:26,420 --> 0:00:27,660
 It doesn't feel like a week,

8
0:00:27,660 --> 0:00:31,560
 but it is seven days since we had the opening talk, almost.

9
0:00:32,880 --> 0:00:36,240
 So we are nearing the end of BornHack,

10
0:00:36,280 --> 0:00:38,800
 and we always do this goodbye world talk

11
0:00:38,800 --> 0:00:41,540
 to kind of sum up what's happened during the week

12
0:00:41,540 --> 0:00:44,920
 and give some fun numbers and just to wrap it all up.

13
0:00:45,680 --> 0:00:48,080
 And following that, we usually crowdsource

14
0:00:48,080 --> 0:00:49,900
 taking down this big tent,

15
0:00:50,020 --> 0:00:53,180
 because it takes 20 minutes for 100 people to do it

16
0:00:53,180 --> 0:00:56,320
 and more than 20 minutes for fewer people.

17
0:00:56,320 --> 0:00:59,820
 So, but we'll get back to that.

18
0:00:59,960 --> 0:01:03,760
 But it's not going to be a very long talk,

19
0:01:03,840 --> 0:01:05,600
 and it's not going to be a lot of information,

20
0:01:05,980 --> 0:01:10,360
 but it's a bit of this and that.

21
0:01:11,340 --> 0:01:13,840
 So, first of all, thank you all for being here.

22
0:01:13,920 --> 0:01:15,600
 It has been wonderful organizing for you.

23
0:01:15,680 --> 0:01:17,920
 We hope you've had as great a time as we have.

24
0:01:18,800 --> 0:01:19,640
 It's been fantastic.

25
0:01:21,500 --> 0:01:24,320
 We will, yes, as I said,

26
0:01:24,320 --> 0:01:26,300
 we have really enjoyed organizing it,

27
0:01:26,380 --> 0:01:28,500
 and the volunteers have been great,

28
0:01:28,740 --> 0:01:30,060
 and all you participants have,

29
0:01:30,700 --> 0:01:32,960
 everybody has been fantastic, as always.

30
0:01:34,720 --> 0:01:41,640
 The schedule was about the same size as last year,

31
0:01:41,880 --> 0:01:45,180
 just under 30 talks, a handful of lightning talks.

32
0:01:45,600 --> 0:01:48,520
 We had more workshops this year than we did last year,

33
0:01:48,600 --> 0:01:50,300
 17 of them, which is awesome.

34
0:01:50,460 --> 0:01:53,560
 I think workshops are one of the really great ways

35
0:01:53,560 --> 0:01:55,120
 of learning, because you kind of,

36
0:01:55,120 --> 0:01:56,300
 kind of,

37
0:01:56,380 --> 0:01:58,140
 get involved and do the stuff right there,

38
0:01:58,140 --> 0:01:59,840
 instead of just sitting and listening to a talk.

39
0:02:00,380 --> 0:02:03,900
 We had a panel debate, like we usually try to do

40
0:02:03,900 --> 0:02:07,800
 with some politicians and discuss some of the issues.

41
0:02:08,600 --> 0:02:12,800
 We had a bunch of meetups where groups, user groups

42
0:02:12,800 --> 0:02:16,920
 for various projects meet up and discuss whatever,

43
0:02:16,920 --> 0:02:17,860
 or just have fun.

44
0:02:18,000 --> 0:02:22,080
 A couple of music acts and a bunch of recreational events

45
0:02:22,080 --> 0:02:26,260
 that are everything from massages to,

46
0:02:26,260 --> 0:02:28,760
 to different, it can be whatever, basically.

47
0:02:30,200 --> 0:02:33,880
 We always like it when it's the participants

48
0:02:33,880 --> 0:02:38,460
 that provide the content on BornHack as much as possible,

49
0:02:38,460 --> 0:02:42,660
 and we've had, again this year, a great success with that,

50
0:02:42,660 --> 0:02:45,940
 because we've had quite few speakers from outside,

51
0:02:45,940 --> 0:02:49,040
 which means that BornHack is really made up

52
0:02:49,040 --> 0:02:52,260
 of the people that are here, and it gives people a chance

53
0:02:52,260 --> 0:02:55,000
 to talk to the speakers, ask questions, and say,

54
0:02:55,000 --> 0:02:56,200
 hey, can you elaborate?

55
0:02:56,200 --> 0:02:59,400
 Can you elaborate on that, or I didn't understand this or that.

56
0:02:59,400 --> 0:03:04,580
 So we feel like we always prefer to have people on site give the talks,

57
0:03:04,580 --> 0:03:07,880
 which means that it's up to all of you to remember to submit.

58
0:03:07,880 --> 0:03:11,420
 So for next year, when the call for participation comes out,

59
0:03:11,420 --> 0:03:14,800
 it'll be out by the end of this year, I think.

60
0:03:14,800 --> 0:03:17,800
 So we probably usually have it open for about six months.

61
0:03:18,380 --> 0:03:21,540
 Make sure you submit some stuff, and the sooner the better,

62
0:03:21,540 --> 0:03:24,240
 because, yeah, for many reasons.

63
0:03:24,240 --> 0:03:26,180
 Getting some content is important.

64
0:03:26,180 --> 0:03:28,400
 Getting some content on the website early

65
0:03:28,400 --> 0:03:30,100
 encourages other people to submit,

66
0:03:30,100 --> 0:03:32,100
 and it helps when we talk to sponsors,

67
0:03:32,100 --> 0:03:34,100
 and they try to figure out what kind of event it is,

68
0:03:34,100 --> 0:03:36,100
 and it helps sell tickets and all that.

69
0:03:36,100 --> 0:03:42,100
 So submit your content as early as you can for next year, please.

70
0:03:42,100 --> 0:03:45,100
 But, yeah, great program this year as well.

71
0:03:45,100 --> 0:03:48,100
 Great program, great job by the content team.

72
0:03:48,100 --> 0:03:52,100
 They've been one or two persons down this year

73
0:03:52,100 --> 0:03:56,100
 from what they usually are, and they've kicked ass.

74
0:03:56,180 --> 0:03:58,180
 So, well done, content team.

75
0:04:05,780 --> 0:04:08,900
 And, of course, the content team goes hand in hand with the video team,

76
0:04:08,900 --> 0:04:12,180
 who've been doing all the productions, streaming to YouTube,

77
0:04:12,180 --> 0:04:15,180
 and as a new thing this year, also to CCC.

78
0:04:15,180 --> 0:04:19,180
 We've been, for years, wanting to not only have YouTube

79
0:04:19,180 --> 0:04:22,180
 as our only streaming platform,

80
0:04:22,180 --> 0:04:25,180
 and I think this will probably be the beginning

81
0:04:25,180 --> 0:04:26,180
 of...

82
0:04:26,180 --> 0:04:30,180
 adding more ways of consuming the BornHack content.

83
0:04:30,180 --> 0:04:35,180
 And the video team has, as always, been here

84
0:04:35,180 --> 0:04:37,180
 when they needed to be and done what they needed to do

85
0:04:37,180 --> 0:04:39,180
 with no big issues.

86
0:04:39,180 --> 0:04:41,180
 So a big hand for them as well.

87
0:04:48,180 --> 0:04:52,180
 Okay, so the network can have a hacker camp

88
0:04:52,180 --> 0:04:55,180
 without some nice internet and some nice network.

89
0:04:55,180 --> 0:05:00,180
 And, again, the NOC team has done an amazing job.

90
0:05:00,180 --> 0:05:04,180
 We upped the bandwidth a bit this year from one to three gigs,

91
0:05:04,180 --> 0:05:08,180
 and we have had peaks over one gig,

92
0:05:08,180 --> 0:05:10,180
 so it's a good thing we did.

93
0:05:10,180 --> 0:05:13,180
 It might be a case of, if it's there, it's going to be used,

94
0:05:13,180 --> 0:05:17,180
 but still, we like that it gets used.

95
0:05:17,180 --> 0:05:20,180
 We had over 300 Wi-Fi clients.

96
0:05:20,180 --> 0:05:22,180
 Some of them turned off at night.

97
0:05:22,180 --> 0:05:23,180
 We guess that's people's laptops,

98
0:05:23,180 --> 0:05:26,180
 and the rest are probably phones and sensors

99
0:05:26,180 --> 0:05:29,180
 and servers and other stuff.

100
0:05:29,180 --> 0:05:30,180
 We've used...

101
0:05:30,180 --> 0:05:31,180
 We have more bandwidth.

102
0:05:31,180 --> 0:05:33,180
 We've used more traffic than ever,

103
0:05:33,180 --> 0:05:37,180
 and there's been no big issues with the network,

104
0:05:37,180 --> 0:05:38,180
 a little thing here and there,

105
0:05:38,180 --> 0:05:40,180
 but generally, they run it.

106
0:05:40,180 --> 0:05:43,180
 They are one of the most self-managing teams.

107
0:05:43,180 --> 0:05:46,180
 We in Orga have very little to do about the network.

108
0:05:46,180 --> 0:05:49,180
 We do the deal with the transit provider

109
0:05:49,180 --> 0:05:52,180
 and get a permission from the music...

110
0:05:52,180 --> 0:05:56,180
 the municipality to get the fiber over the road,

111
0:05:56,180 --> 0:05:57,180
 and that is pretty much it.

112
0:05:57,180 --> 0:06:00,180
 Then they handle all the rest themselves,

113
0:06:00,180 --> 0:06:02,180
 which is, as you can imagine,

114
0:06:02,180 --> 0:06:04,180
 as organizers, really, really nice,

115
0:06:04,180 --> 0:06:07,180
 because teams that can manage themselves

116
0:06:07,180 --> 0:06:09,180
 mean that we have time left over

117
0:06:09,180 --> 0:06:11,180
 to manage the teams that can't

118
0:06:11,180 --> 0:06:12,180
 or to do other stuff

119
0:06:12,180 --> 0:06:14,180
 or to just do nothing once in a while.

120
0:06:14,180 --> 0:06:16,180
 So that's very nice.

121
0:06:16,180 --> 0:06:18,180
 So, yeah, NOC team, well done.

122
0:06:22,180 --> 0:06:27,180
 Of course, we can't have NOC without power,

123
0:06:27,180 --> 0:06:30,180
 and we don't have fancy numbers for the power consumption.

124
0:06:30,180 --> 0:06:33,180
 We have it on our to-do, but we haven't gotten it done yet.

125
0:06:33,180 --> 0:06:37,180
 But other than a bit low voltage here and there

126
0:06:37,180 --> 0:06:40,180
 and the odd breaker circuit turning off

127
0:06:40,180 --> 0:06:44,180
 because of overload or some broken damaged equipment,

128
0:06:44,180 --> 0:06:45,180
 we've had power all week.

129
0:06:45,180 --> 0:06:47,180
 It's been cheaper than ever to do it

130
0:06:47,180 --> 0:06:50,180
 because of some clever planning by the power team,

131
0:06:50,180 --> 0:06:51,180
 and it's been stable,

132
0:06:51,180 --> 0:06:54,180
 and they deserve a big hand as well.

133
0:07:08,180 --> 0:07:10,180
 It's crazy. I'm so thirsty.

134
0:07:10,180 --> 0:07:13,180
 After all, I drank last night. It's weird.

135
0:07:13,180 --> 0:07:15,180
 OK.

136
0:07:15,180 --> 0:07:19,180
 So, speaking of the bar numbers,

137
0:07:19,180 --> 0:07:20,180
 as of this afternoon,

138
0:07:20,180 --> 0:07:21,180
 the bar numbers,

139
0:07:21,180 --> 0:07:24,180
 the bar had sold for 121,000 hacks,

140
0:07:24,180 --> 0:07:26,180
 which is pretty crazy.

141
0:07:32,180 --> 0:07:34,180
 It is far exceeding last year,

142
0:07:34,180 --> 0:07:37,180
 and I think we're actually close to exceeding combined

143
0:07:37,180 --> 0:07:38,180
 the last two years.

144
0:07:38,180 --> 0:07:40,180
 So that is fantastic.

145
0:07:40,180 --> 0:07:46,180
 We sold almost 3,200 items in 2,200 transactions,

146
0:07:46,180 --> 0:07:48,180
 666 liters of beer.

147
0:07:48,180 --> 0:07:50,180
 That's a very nice number.

148
0:07:50,180 --> 0:07:52,180
 370 liters of mate,

149
0:07:52,180 --> 0:07:55,180
 165 of the Kogyu-based drinks,

150
0:07:55,180 --> 0:07:57,180
 19 Tsunamis.

151
0:07:57,180 --> 0:08:01,180
 I didn't drink any of them this year.

152
0:08:01,180 --> 0:08:05,180
 And just thank you all for using the bar.

153
0:08:05,180 --> 0:08:08,180
 It is one of three incomes we have.

154
0:08:08,180 --> 0:08:09,180
 We have the ticket sales,

155
0:08:09,180 --> 0:08:10,180
 we have our sponsor money,

156
0:08:10,180 --> 0:08:12,180
 and then we have the income from the bar.

157
0:08:12,180 --> 0:08:15,180
 So it is very appreciated that you use it,

158
0:08:15,180 --> 0:08:17,180
 even though you could just go to the supermarket

159
0:08:17,180 --> 0:08:18,180
 and get beers there,

160
0:08:18,180 --> 0:08:19,180
 but many people choose to use it.

161
0:08:19,180 --> 0:08:23,180
 The bar team every year does a lot of work

162
0:08:23,180 --> 0:08:24,180
 up to the event,

163
0:08:24,180 --> 0:08:27,180
 getting fancy beers from microbreweries

164
0:08:27,180 --> 0:08:29,180
 and organizing all the deals

165
0:08:29,180 --> 0:08:31,180
 and getting a nice selection.

166
0:08:31,180 --> 0:08:34,180
 And of course, tirelessly during the week,

167
0:08:34,180 --> 0:08:38,180
 almost 24 hours a day,

168
0:08:38,180 --> 0:08:41,180
 they are behind the bar serving us all.

169
0:08:41,180 --> 0:08:43,180
 A massive hand for them.

170
0:08:49,180 --> 0:08:54,180
 Remember, the bar is open tonight,

171
0:08:54,180 --> 0:08:55,180
 so when we are done here,

172
0:08:55,180 --> 0:08:57,180
 you can go spend your last hacks

173
0:08:57,180 --> 0:09:01,180
 and up these numbers a bit more.

174
0:09:01,180 --> 0:09:03,180
 Okay, so the secret token game

175
0:09:03,180 --> 0:09:05,180
 was a thing again this year.

176
0:09:05,180 --> 0:09:09,180
 The game team has really, really taken off this year

177
0:09:09,180 --> 0:09:12,180
 and done a lot of the stuff that we used to do in Orga.

178
0:09:12,180 --> 0:09:14,180
 It is very much appreciated,

179
0:09:14,180 --> 0:09:17,180
 and also it means that the game parts of Born Hack

180
0:09:17,180 --> 0:09:19,180
 have been getting more and more popular.

181
0:09:19,180 --> 0:09:21,180
 They have gotten more and better attention,

182
0:09:21,180 --> 0:09:23,180
 which means the token game has been bigger than ever.

183
0:09:23,180 --> 0:09:27,180
 There was 42 tokens around the venue,

184
0:09:27,180 --> 0:09:29,180
 online and physically.

185
0:09:29,180 --> 0:09:32,180
 The 187 is the wrong number.

186
0:09:32,180 --> 0:09:33,180
 I didn't get that updated.

187
0:09:33,180 --> 0:09:36,180
 How much was it, Dennis?

188
0:09:36,180 --> 0:09:39,180
 695 tokens have been found throughout,

189
0:09:39,180 --> 0:09:42,180
 in a total combined.

190
0:09:42,180 --> 0:09:44,180
 44 users have played,

191
0:09:44,180 --> 0:09:47,180
 and they found almost 700 tokens.

192
0:09:47,180 --> 0:09:49,180
 Three players actually found all tokens

193
0:09:49,180 --> 0:09:51,180
 so they, and I don't know how,

194
0:09:51,180 --> 0:09:52,180
 but they win the ticket

195
0:09:52,180 --> 0:09:54,180
 and they get to decide who gets it.

196
0:09:54,180 --> 0:09:58,180
 Maybe some sort of cage fighting can be organized.

197
0:09:58,180 --> 0:10:00,180
 But a very big hand for the game team

198
0:10:00,180 --> 0:10:01,180
 and for the winners.

199
0:10:11,180 --> 0:10:16,180
 Okay, I've said this a couple of times already,

200
0:10:16,180 --> 0:10:17,180
 put it in the slides,

201
0:10:17,180 --> 0:10:19,180
 so I'm sure it would get enough attention.

202
0:10:19,180 --> 0:10:21,180
 We cannot stress enough

203
0:10:21,180 --> 0:10:23,180
 how much we appreciate you all helping out.

204
0:10:23,180 --> 0:10:26,180
 It is impossible to do this alone,

205
0:10:26,180 --> 0:10:28,180
 even though we would if we could,

206
0:10:28,180 --> 0:10:29,180
 so everybody could just relax,

207
0:10:29,180 --> 0:10:31,180
 but it is just not possible.

208
0:10:31,180 --> 0:10:34,180
 And we have new people helping out this year,

209
0:10:34,180 --> 0:10:36,180
 and thanks to them.

210
0:10:36,180 --> 0:10:40,180
 Also, of course, thanks to all the known faces

211
0:10:40,180 --> 0:10:42,180
 that come here year after year and help out.

212
0:10:42,180 --> 0:10:44,180
 You know who you are,

213
0:10:44,180 --> 0:10:46,180
 and it is very, very much appreciated.

214
0:10:46,180 --> 0:10:48,180
 Please stand up, all the volunteers,

215
0:10:48,180 --> 0:10:50,180
 cheers, and receive a round of applause.

216
0:11:14,180 --> 0:11:16,180
 Yes, good.

217
0:11:16,180 --> 0:11:18,180
 Okay.

218
0:11:18,180 --> 0:11:21,180
 So teardown begins tomorrow,

219
0:11:21,180 --> 0:11:24,180
 kind of slowly starting now,

220
0:11:24,180 --> 0:11:26,180
 but from tomorrow for real.

221
0:11:26,180 --> 0:11:29,180
 We need help with all kinds of things,

222
0:11:29,180 --> 0:11:30,180
 little and big things.

223
0:11:30,180 --> 0:11:33,180
 It is from cleaning up a little piece of trash

224
0:11:33,180 --> 0:11:34,180
 or something you see lying around

225
0:11:34,180 --> 0:11:36,180
 that didn't get picked up by somebody else,

226
0:11:36,180 --> 0:11:39,180
 then pick it up and put it somewhere where it makes sense.

227
0:11:39,180 --> 0:11:41,180
 Ask the yellow vests if you have nothing to do.

228
0:11:41,180 --> 0:11:44,180
 We usually have little jobs here and there

229
0:11:44,180 --> 0:11:47,180
 that we need some help with.

230
0:11:48,180 --> 0:11:50,180
 Little things help as well.

231
0:11:50,180 --> 0:11:53,180
 I mean, 10 or 20 or 30 minutes spent doing something

232
0:11:53,180 --> 0:11:56,180
 can save us that time in the other end.

233
0:11:56,180 --> 0:11:58,180
 So please help out if you can.

234
0:11:58,180 --> 0:12:00,180
 Stay one or two more days.

235
0:12:00,180 --> 0:12:02,180
 It is a lot of fun also doing the teardown.

236
0:12:02,180 --> 0:12:04,180
 We have great food,

237
0:12:04,180 --> 0:12:06,180
 and there will be leftovers from the bar and all that.

238
0:12:06,180 --> 0:12:09,180
 So we're going to enjoy ourselves in addition to working.

239
0:12:09,180 --> 0:12:14,180
 And of course, we need to have a nice, safe, efficient teardown,

240
0:12:14,180 --> 0:12:17,180
 and everybody should leave here with feeling like that.

241
0:12:17,180 --> 0:12:19,180
 Feeling like they haven't been overworked,

242
0:12:19,180 --> 0:12:21,180
 because then they will come back next year

243
0:12:21,180 --> 0:12:24,180
 and help out again.

244
0:12:24,180 --> 0:12:26,180
 So if you have a village tent,

245
0:12:26,180 --> 0:12:28,180
 you can help us a lot by taking it down yourself.

246
0:12:28,180 --> 0:12:31,180
 If you don't know how, then come and ask us.

247
0:12:31,180 --> 0:12:34,180
 We know how to do it without getting hurt.

248
0:12:34,180 --> 0:12:36,180
 It is not a lot of work,

249
0:12:36,180 --> 0:12:38,180
 but if we have to do all the tents ourselves,

250
0:12:38,180 --> 0:12:40,180
 it becomes a lot of work.

251
0:12:40,180 --> 0:12:42,180
 So by taking it down and just stacking it,

252
0:12:42,180 --> 0:12:43,180
 you're already helping.

253
0:12:43,180 --> 0:12:45,180
 And if you go to one of the vests

254
0:12:45,180 --> 0:12:46,180
 and ask where to put the stuff

255
0:12:46,180 --> 0:12:48,180
 after it's been taken down, even better.

256
0:12:51,180 --> 0:12:55,180
 We have coordination meetings during teardown,

257
0:12:55,180 --> 0:12:59,180
 three meals a day at 9, at 1, and at 8.

258
0:12:59,180 --> 0:13:02,180
 And in addition to that,

259
0:13:02,180 --> 0:13:04,180
 we have a coordination meeting at the info desk

260
0:13:04,180 --> 0:13:06,180
 at 4 in the afternoon.

261
0:13:06,180 --> 0:13:10,180
 And the first meeting is tomorrow at 4 at the info desk,

262
0:13:10,180 --> 0:13:14,180
 and then we meet again at 8 for food in the cabins,

263
0:13:14,180 --> 0:13:16,180
 which some of you know as the workshop,

264
0:13:16,180 --> 0:13:20,180
 but they are converted to volunteer food place

265
0:13:20,180 --> 0:13:22,180
 and stuff for the teardown.

266
0:13:22,180 --> 0:13:24,180
 If you want to stay for teardown

267
0:13:24,180 --> 0:13:25,180
 and want to take down your tent,

268
0:13:25,180 --> 0:13:28,180
 maybe because you're concerned about it getting wet or something,

269
0:13:28,180 --> 0:13:31,180
 the cabin beds, you are welcome to use them.

270
0:13:31,180 --> 0:13:36,180
 Even if you haven't bought a bed from tomorrow at noon,

271
0:13:36,180 --> 0:13:39,180
 they are free for all.

272
0:13:39,180 --> 0:13:42,180
 So meeting tomorrow at 4,

273
0:13:42,180 --> 0:13:45,180
 and then the standard meals from starting tomorrow,

274
0:13:45,180 --> 0:13:47,180
 starting tomorrow evening,

275
0:13:47,180 --> 0:13:51,180
 where Jonathan is cooking, and yeah.

276
0:13:51,180 --> 0:13:54,180
 Okay, we have the venue until Sunday.

277
0:13:54,180 --> 0:13:56,180
 Some of the stuff isn't getting picked up until Monday,

278
0:13:56,180 --> 0:14:00,180
 but we expect to be far away by then.

279
0:14:00,180 --> 0:14:03,180
 The forklift is coming Sunday to pack all the stuff,

280
0:14:03,180 --> 0:14:05,180
 all the tents and stuff, into the lorry,

281
0:14:05,180 --> 0:14:08,180
 so by then we should have it all ready for him to pack,

282
0:14:08,180 --> 0:14:13,180
 and we think we will have most of the tents down tomorrow,

283
0:14:13,180 --> 0:14:14,180
 and we'll leave the food area, too.

284
0:14:14,180 --> 0:14:20,180
 We'll leave the food area tent for Friday because, yeah.

285
0:14:20,180 --> 0:14:22,180
 Okay.

286
0:14:22,180 --> 0:14:25,180
 So if you have any feedback about the event,

287
0:14:25,180 --> 0:14:28,180
 good or bad, we really want to hear it.

288
0:14:28,180 --> 0:14:30,180
 The good feedback helps us,

289
0:14:30,180 --> 0:14:32,180
 keeps us motivated and helps us feel good,

290
0:14:32,180 --> 0:14:35,180
 and the bad feedback helps us improve the event,

291
0:14:35,180 --> 0:14:37,180
 so we want it all, please.

292
0:14:37,180 --> 0:14:38,180
 You can submit it on the website,

293
0:14:38,180 --> 0:14:41,180
 and on the website in the program on each event,

294
0:14:41,180 --> 0:14:43,180
 there's also a feedback button,

295
0:14:43,180 --> 0:14:46,180
 which is feedback for that specific event.

296
0:14:46,180 --> 0:14:47,180
 Please use that as well,

297
0:14:47,180 --> 0:14:50,180
 so the content team knows what worked and what didn't work,

298
0:14:50,180 --> 0:14:54,180
 and they can use it for preparing next year's schedule.

299
0:14:54,180 --> 0:14:58,180
 It really means a lot that we get this feedback,

300
0:14:58,180 --> 0:15:01,180
 because, of course,

301
0:15:01,180 --> 0:15:06,180
 we want to make the program as good as we can for our audience,

302
0:15:06,180 --> 0:15:11,180
 and we can only do that if we know what you like and dislike.

303
0:15:11,180 --> 0:15:12,180
 Yes?

304
0:15:12,180 --> 0:15:13,180
 Okay.

305
0:15:13,180 --> 0:15:16,180
 If you lost or found anything,

306
0:15:16,180 --> 0:15:19,180
 then maybe drop by the info desk.

307
0:15:19,180 --> 0:15:23,180
 We usually have a box of weird things after this event

308
0:15:23,180 --> 0:15:25,180
 that we don't really know what to do with.

309
0:15:25,180 --> 0:15:29,180
 The more of that can get to the proper owners

310
0:15:29,180 --> 0:15:31,180
 before we leave, the better.

311
0:15:31,180 --> 0:15:33,180
 So go to the info desk if you found something,

312
0:15:33,180 --> 0:15:35,180
 go there if you lost something.

313
0:15:38,180 --> 0:15:41,180
 Our food vendor, we think it's been a great success.

314
0:15:41,180 --> 0:15:42,180
 It was the first time we used them.

315
0:15:42,180 --> 0:15:44,180
 Very delicious food,

316
0:15:44,180 --> 0:15:46,180
 and they will be here tomorrow until 2,

317
0:15:46,180 --> 0:15:48,180
 and then they will leave,

318
0:15:48,180 --> 0:15:53,180
 and we will be eating teardown food in the building.

319
0:15:53,180 --> 0:15:56,180
 Like I said, the food area tent will stay up a bit longer.

320
0:15:56,180 --> 0:16:02,180
 The fridges are getting picked up by a delivery courier thing

321
0:16:02,180 --> 0:16:06,180
 on Friday at 11,

322
0:16:06,180 --> 0:16:09,180
 so all the fridges need to be emptied,

323
0:16:09,180 --> 0:16:11,180
 and they'll be cleaned.

324
0:16:11,180 --> 0:16:14,180
 They'll be cleaned Thursday afternoon.

325
0:16:14,180 --> 0:16:17,180
 Tomorrow afternoon, the fridges will be cleaned.

326
0:16:17,180 --> 0:16:19,180
 So if you have stuff in fridges in the food area,

327
0:16:19,180 --> 0:16:24,180
 it needs to be out by tomorrow early afternoon.

328
0:16:24,180 --> 0:16:26,180
 The stuff that is left in the fridges,

329
0:16:26,180 --> 0:16:27,180
 we will have to throw it out.

330
0:16:27,180 --> 0:16:29,180
 The stuff we can't use,

331
0:16:29,180 --> 0:16:32,180
 we can't really take it because of corona and stuff.

332
0:16:32,180 --> 0:16:35,180
 We can't really just take it and serve it to our volunteers.

333
0:16:35,180 --> 0:16:37,180
 So please use it yourselves if you can,

334
0:16:37,180 --> 0:16:40,180
 and the rest we will have to throw out, unfortunately.

335
0:16:40,180 --> 0:16:42,180
 The fridges are getting cleaned tomorrow afternoon,

336
0:16:42,180 --> 0:16:44,180
 so make sure you empty them, please.

337
0:16:47,180 --> 0:16:50,180
 Unopened stuff, of course, can go to the kitchen,

338
0:16:50,180 --> 0:16:52,180
 to Jonathan, and he can sort it

339
0:16:52,180 --> 0:16:55,180
 and see what we can use and what we can't use.

340
0:16:56,180 --> 0:16:57,180
 Okay.

341
0:16:57,180 --> 0:16:59,180
 This lovely contraption, the speaker's desk,

342
0:16:59,180 --> 0:17:01,180
 we have a tradition.

343
0:17:01,180 --> 0:17:02,180
 It started out the first year

344
0:17:02,180 --> 0:17:04,180
 because the construction team wasn't really happy

345
0:17:04,180 --> 0:17:06,180
 with the speaker's desk, so we burned it.

346
0:17:06,180 --> 0:17:08,180
 And then the next year, it kind of just became a tradition,

347
0:17:08,180 --> 0:17:09,180
 so we burned it again.

348
0:17:09,180 --> 0:17:10,180
 And then since then,

349
0:17:10,180 --> 0:17:12,180
 we've just always been burning the speaker's desk

350
0:17:12,180 --> 0:17:13,180
 when we're done.

351
0:17:13,180 --> 0:17:16,180
 We are, of course, going to do that this year as well.

352
0:17:16,180 --> 0:17:19,180
 And we will do it tomorrow at 23

353
0:17:19,180 --> 0:17:22,180
 in the big fireplace at Main Camping,

354
0:17:22,180 --> 0:17:24,180
 unless it's coming down in droves,

355
0:17:24,180 --> 0:17:26,180
 in which case we'll reschedule.

356
0:17:26,180 --> 0:17:29,180
 But we will find a dry...

357
0:17:29,180 --> 0:17:31,180
 an hour with dry weather at some point

358
0:17:31,180 --> 0:17:33,180
 to burn this bastard.

359
0:17:34,180 --> 0:17:35,180
 Okay.

360
0:17:35,180 --> 0:17:38,180
 And it's usually great fun because it's a big campfire,

361
0:17:38,180 --> 0:17:42,180
 and you get to just sit down and reflect on the week.

362
0:17:42,180 --> 0:17:46,180
 It's one of the very nice things during Teardown.

363
0:17:47,180 --> 0:17:48,180
 Okay.

364
0:17:48,180 --> 0:17:51,180
 You've probably all been at events before,

365
0:17:51,180 --> 0:17:53,180
 and you felt that little sting when you go home.

366
0:17:53,180 --> 0:17:57,180
 That's kind of a sad, bluesy feeling

367
0:17:57,180 --> 0:17:59,180
 because you've been surrounded by awesomeness

368
0:17:59,180 --> 0:18:01,180
 and awesome people for a week,

369
0:18:01,180 --> 0:18:05,180
 and then you go home to just kind of everyday life.

370
0:18:05,180 --> 0:18:07,180
 And it can be a bit rough.

371
0:18:07,180 --> 0:18:10,180
 Suggestions for suggested remedies include

372
0:18:10,180 --> 0:18:13,180
 watching the talks you missed on YouTube.

373
0:18:13,180 --> 0:18:15,180
 You can play with your badge.

374
0:18:15,180 --> 0:18:16,180
 Solder some stuff on it

375
0:18:16,180 --> 0:18:18,180
 or attach it to the badge from last year.

376
0:18:18,180 --> 0:18:20,180
 Remember to tell us if you do something cool with it.

377
0:18:20,180 --> 0:18:22,180
 Floma and the rest of the badge team

378
0:18:22,180 --> 0:18:24,180
 always likes to know when we...

379
0:18:24,180 --> 0:18:27,180
 when people do cool stuff with the badges.

380
0:18:27,180 --> 0:18:29,180
 You can organize your pictures.

381
0:18:29,180 --> 0:18:31,180
 Send us cool pictures.

382
0:18:31,180 --> 0:18:33,180
 We really want to see them.

383
0:18:33,180 --> 0:18:35,180
 I know we care a lot about them,

384
0:18:35,180 --> 0:18:36,180
 and we want to see them.

385
0:18:36,180 --> 0:18:38,180
 I know we care a lot about the photo policy,

386
0:18:38,180 --> 0:18:40,180
 but with that out of the way,

387
0:18:40,180 --> 0:18:43,180
 we absolutely love pictures and want to see them.

388
0:18:43,180 --> 0:18:46,180
 And we are doing a photo thing

389
0:18:46,180 --> 0:18:48,180
 on the BornHack website before next year,

390
0:18:48,180 --> 0:18:50,180
 so we'll use that to organize our own photos,

391
0:18:50,180 --> 0:18:53,180
 and we would love to see your photos there as well.

392
0:18:55,180 --> 0:18:56,180
 Stay in touch.

393
0:18:56,180 --> 0:18:59,180
 The IRC channel is active all year round.

394
0:18:59,180 --> 0:19:01,180
 Feel free to hang out there

395
0:19:01,180 --> 0:19:05,180
 and just stay in touch with friends.

396
0:19:06,180 --> 0:19:09,180
 New and old friends.

397
0:19:09,180 --> 0:19:11,180
 You can buy a ticket for next year.

398
0:19:11,180 --> 0:19:13,180
 They will be up for sale shortly.

399
0:19:13,180 --> 0:19:15,180
 Not today or this week,

400
0:19:15,180 --> 0:19:17,180
 but in a month or so.

401
0:19:17,180 --> 0:19:18,180
 It won't be...

402
0:19:18,180 --> 0:19:21,180
 It will be this year in a month or two or something.

403
0:19:21,180 --> 0:19:24,180
 And just keep hacking the world

404
0:19:24,180 --> 0:19:26,180
 and stay awesome.

405
0:19:29,180 --> 0:19:31,180
 The next BornHack in 22

406
0:19:31,180 --> 0:19:34,180
 will be from the 3rd to the 10th of August.

407
0:19:34,180 --> 0:19:37,180
 This has been coordinated with the MCH org,

408
0:19:37,180 --> 0:19:42,180
 so it should be possible to do MCH as a little warm-up

409
0:19:42,180 --> 0:19:44,180
 and then go straight to BornHack

410
0:19:44,180 --> 0:19:47,180
 and help with the build-up after MCH is done.

411
0:19:47,180 --> 0:19:50,180
 Should be a lovely trip.

412
0:19:59,180 --> 0:20:02,180
 We did it the other way around in 2019

413
0:20:02,180 --> 0:20:04,180
 where we took all of BornHack

414
0:20:04,180 --> 0:20:07,180
 and hacked down and basically packed it in the Avis car

415
0:20:07,180 --> 0:20:09,180
 and then drove to CCC and put it all up again

416
0:20:09,180 --> 0:20:11,180
 and had a big BornHack village, all of us,

417
0:20:11,180 --> 0:20:13,180
 and it was just absolutely lovely.

418
0:20:13,180 --> 0:20:15,180
 This is going to be the other way around,

419
0:20:15,180 --> 0:20:18,180
 so we are going to arrive all hacked out from MCH

420
0:20:18,180 --> 0:20:20,180
 and then we will build up BornHack

421
0:20:20,180 --> 0:20:22,180
 and do another week.

422
0:20:22,180 --> 0:20:26,180
 So remember to mark the dates in your calendar.

423
0:20:26,180 --> 0:20:28,180
 We expect to see everybody and then some,

424
0:20:28,180 --> 0:20:30,180
 and we are already looking forward to it.

425
0:20:30,180 --> 0:20:32,180
 We have a lot of ideas for improvements

426
0:20:32,180 --> 0:20:33,180
 and if you do,

427
0:20:33,180 --> 0:20:36,180
 remember to use the feedback page.

428
0:20:38,180 --> 0:20:41,180
 Another way to combat the post-BornHack blues

429
0:20:41,180 --> 0:20:44,180
 is to buy some bar inventory and take it home

430
0:20:44,180 --> 0:20:46,180
 and just go to town.

431
0:20:46,180 --> 0:20:51,180
 We have organized a pop-up bar next to the info desk

432
0:20:51,180 --> 0:20:53,180
 that will be open tomorrow.

433
0:20:53,180 --> 0:20:56,180
 They will be selling the surplus inventory,

434
0:20:56,180 --> 0:21:00,180
 so if you want a case of mate or vodka or beer

435
0:21:00,180 --> 0:21:02,180
 or aquavit or sabre bar,

436
0:21:02,180 --> 0:21:07,180
 then you can get it at reduced prices.

437
0:21:07,180 --> 0:21:09,180
 We have a bunch of inventory

438
0:21:09,180 --> 0:21:11,180
 and we want to get rid of it.

439
0:21:11,180 --> 0:21:13,180
 So fill up your cars

440
0:21:13,180 --> 0:21:16,180
 so we don't have to keep dragging it around.

441
0:21:20,180 --> 0:21:22,180
 Okay, final thing.

442
0:21:22,180 --> 0:21:25,180
 We want your help to take down the speaker stand.

443
0:21:25,180 --> 0:21:29,180
 This has been a tradition since the first year.

444
0:21:29,180 --> 0:21:33,180
 We usually do it pretty fast

445
0:21:33,180 --> 0:21:35,180
 because we are a lot of people.

446
0:21:35,180 --> 0:21:37,180
 The first couple of years we timed it,

447
0:21:37,180 --> 0:21:39,180
 but nerds being nerds and very competitive,

448
0:21:39,180 --> 0:21:42,180
 we stopped doing that because it was getting a bit dangerous

449
0:21:42,180 --> 0:21:44,180
 because people were, you know,

450
0:21:44,180 --> 0:21:46,180
 and first of all we want people to stay safe.

451
0:21:46,180 --> 0:21:49,180
 So here are the ground rules for this.

452
0:21:49,180 --> 0:21:52,180
 Everybody in Orga has a vest on

453
0:21:52,180 --> 0:21:54,180
 and they call the shots.

454
0:21:54,180 --> 0:21:56,180
 They know how to do this safely,

455
0:21:56,180 --> 0:21:58,180
 so listen to them.

456
0:21:58,180 --> 0:22:00,180
 First thing we do is take all the chairs

457
0:22:00,180 --> 0:22:03,180
 and stick them in the Avis car on the road.

458
0:22:03,180 --> 0:22:06,180
 They just need to be stacked in stacks.

459
0:22:06,180 --> 0:22:09,180
 Stacks of four?

460
0:22:09,180 --> 0:22:11,180
 For easy carrying.

461
0:22:11,180 --> 0:22:13,180
 Stacks of four and there will be somebody in the...

462
0:22:13,180 --> 0:22:15,180
 a couple of people in the car

463
0:22:15,180 --> 0:22:17,180
 and then a bunch of people going back and forth with chairs.

464
0:22:17,180 --> 0:22:19,180
 That should be over.

465
0:22:19,180 --> 0:22:21,180
 With this amount of people, that should be over very quickly.

466
0:22:21,180 --> 0:22:23,180
 The next thing is we stack the tables.

467
0:22:23,180 --> 0:22:25,180
 They go on pallets out here.

468
0:22:25,180 --> 0:22:26,180
 The yellow...

469
0:22:26,180 --> 0:22:27,180
 Oops, sorry.

470
0:22:27,180 --> 0:22:30,180
 Vests know how the stuff should be stacked on the pallets

471
0:22:30,180 --> 0:22:34,180
 and we have many times failed in doing this right,

472
0:22:34,180 --> 0:22:36,180
 so we've had to restack it

473
0:22:36,180 --> 0:22:38,180
 and that is just absolutely no fun.

474
0:22:38,180 --> 0:22:41,180
 So please do not put anything on the pallets

475
0:22:41,180 --> 0:22:43,180
 unless there's a vest next to you

476
0:22:43,180 --> 0:22:45,180
 saying how it should be done

477
0:22:45,180 --> 0:22:48,180
 because we've tried this again and again

478
0:22:48,180 --> 0:22:50,180
 and we always seem to mess it up for some reason.

479
0:22:50,180 --> 0:22:53,180
 So this year we are trying again

480
0:22:53,180 --> 0:22:55,180
 and we want to get it right.

481
0:22:55,180 --> 0:22:56,180
 So...

482
0:22:57,180 --> 0:22:59,180
 Tables go on pallets.

483
0:22:59,180 --> 0:23:02,180
 Ask the yellow vests how they go on.

484
0:23:02,180 --> 0:23:04,180
 Third, when that is done,

485
0:23:04,180 --> 0:23:06,180
 the stage has to come apart

486
0:23:06,180 --> 0:23:12,180
 and the content team will take the technical stuff down

487
0:23:12,180 --> 0:23:14,180
 but then the stage needs to be...

488
0:23:14,180 --> 0:23:15,180
 It's screwed together

489
0:23:15,180 --> 0:23:18,180
 and it needs to be disassembled and taken apart

490
0:23:18,180 --> 0:23:22,180
 and finally the floor can be taken up

491
0:23:22,180 --> 0:23:25,180
 and the floor also gets stacked on two pallets out here

492
0:23:25,180 --> 0:23:26,180
 and the same rules apply.

493
0:23:26,180 --> 0:23:29,180
 Do not stack it because we don't want to restack it.

494
0:23:29,180 --> 0:23:32,180
 Do not stack it without a vest telling you how to do it

495
0:23:32,180 --> 0:23:34,180
 or unless there's already a bunch

496
0:23:34,180 --> 0:23:36,180
 and you can see how they're supposed to be.

497
0:23:38,180 --> 0:23:41,180
 Finally, when the tent is empty,

498
0:23:41,180 --> 0:23:43,180
 we take off the sides

499
0:23:43,180 --> 0:23:46,180
 and they also get stacked on pallets out here.

500
0:23:46,180 --> 0:23:48,180
 Again, the organizers know how to do it.

501
0:23:48,180 --> 0:23:50,180
 Then we pull down the roof.

502
0:23:50,180 --> 0:23:52,180
 They also get stacked on pallets

503
0:23:52,180 --> 0:23:55,180
 and finally, when just the metal skeleton is back,

504
0:23:55,180 --> 0:23:56,180
 we take that down.

505
0:23:56,180 --> 0:23:58,180
 That's the only actual dangerous part

506
0:23:58,180 --> 0:24:00,180
 so we'll be a bit shouty while it happens

507
0:24:00,180 --> 0:24:04,180
 because we want to make sure nobody stands under the heaviest things

508
0:24:04,180 --> 0:24:05,180
 while we take them down.

509
0:24:05,180 --> 0:24:09,180
 But other than that, please don't stand directly under,

510
0:24:09,180 --> 0:24:11,180
 just stand nearby

511
0:24:11,180 --> 0:24:14,180
 and help carry the metal down to the road

512
0:24:14,180 --> 0:24:16,180
 and we put it in the Avis car

513
0:24:16,180 --> 0:24:18,180
 and drive it down to the parking lot

514
0:24:18,180 --> 0:24:20,180
 at the bottom of the road.

515
0:24:20,180 --> 0:24:22,180
 And that's it.

516
0:24:22,180 --> 0:24:24,180
 It usually takes 20 to 30 minutes,

517
0:24:24,180 --> 0:24:27,180
 and maybe 45 until we're completely done

518
0:24:27,180 --> 0:24:29,180
 and there's a ratchet on everything.

519
0:24:29,180 --> 0:24:31,180
 But a good 20, 30 minutes,

520
0:24:31,180 --> 0:24:33,180
 if everybody could spare that,

521
0:24:33,180 --> 0:24:37,180
 we could get this bad boy down in very little time.

522
0:24:38,180 --> 0:24:40,180
 Any questions about the tent stuff?

523
0:24:40,180 --> 0:24:42,180
 Anything I forgot to say?

524
0:24:47,180 --> 0:24:49,180
 Oh, very nice.

525
0:24:49,180 --> 0:24:51,180
 Okay, so those of you who know Anke,

526
0:24:51,180 --> 0:24:53,180
 our Missing in Action organizer

527
0:24:53,180 --> 0:24:55,180
 who has been, even though she knew

528
0:24:55,180 --> 0:24:57,180
 she wasn't going to be able to make it this year,

529
0:24:57,180 --> 0:24:59,180
 has been working tirelessly organizing

530
0:24:59,180 --> 0:25:02,180
 or fixing content, doing info pages,

531
0:25:02,180 --> 0:25:04,180
 responding to info emails and all that crap,

532
0:25:04,180 --> 0:25:06,180
 even though she's not coming,

533
0:25:06,180 --> 0:25:08,180
 which is quite a feat.

534
0:25:08,180 --> 0:25:11,180
 She couldn't come for corona-related stuff.

535
0:25:11,180 --> 0:25:13,180
 So we made this very nice,

536
0:25:13,180 --> 0:25:16,180
 and when I say we, I had absolutely nothing to do with it,

537
0:25:16,180 --> 0:25:18,180
 but Mom made this very nice.

538
0:25:18,180 --> 0:25:19,180
 We love Anke's sign.

539
0:25:19,180 --> 0:25:21,180
 We're putting it in the bar.

540
0:25:21,180 --> 0:25:22,180
 I'm sure she would love it.

541
0:25:22,180 --> 0:25:24,180
 People would come by, take a picture with it,

542
0:25:24,180 --> 0:25:26,180
 and send it to her.

543
0:25:27,180 --> 0:25:29,180
 Yeah, we'll put the sign in the bar,

544
0:25:29,180 --> 0:25:31,180
 and we can do that later.

545
0:25:41,180 --> 0:25:43,180
 Okay, so just to sum up,

546
0:25:43,180 --> 0:25:45,180
 when you stand up, take your chair,

547
0:25:45,180 --> 0:25:47,180
 take the chair next to it,

548
0:25:47,180 --> 0:25:49,180
 go carry it to the Avis car,

549
0:25:49,180 --> 0:25:51,180
 then the tables go on the pallets,

550
0:25:51,180 --> 0:25:53,180
 then the floors, then the sides,

551
0:25:53,180 --> 0:25:55,180
 then the rest of the tent.

552
0:25:55,180 --> 0:25:57,180
 Somebody who knows how to use tools

553
0:25:57,180 --> 0:25:59,180
 can start on the stage.

554
0:25:59,180 --> 0:26:01,180
 And thank you, everybody.

555
0:26:01,180 --> 0:26:03,180
 We'll see you later at the bar.
