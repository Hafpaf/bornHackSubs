0:00:00,000 --> 0:00:08,600
 Welcome to this talk.

2
0:00:08,920 --> 0:00:11,080
 Anders Kjell will talk about manualization.

3
0:00:12,580 --> 0:00:13,760
 Thank you very much.

4
0:00:15,680 --> 0:00:18,880
 First of all, thank you very much for coming here and listening to me.

5
0:00:19,200 --> 0:00:25,180
 I will just do a short wrap-up of what you're going to hear and what I'm going to talk about.

6
0:00:25,180 --> 0:00:32,360
 As you can probably guess, the word manualization is a reverse automization,

7
0:00:33,160 --> 0:00:36,360
 which is part of what I'm going to talk about today.

8
0:00:36,840 --> 0:00:39,340
 A bit about me, for those who don't know me, I'm a journalist.

9
0:00:39,500 --> 0:00:43,880
 I used to have a radio show about surveillance for seven years.

10
0:00:44,700 --> 0:00:51,860
 Currently, I'm a techno-critic and a writer and one of the founders of the Analogization Agency,

11
0:00:51,860 --> 0:00:55,060
 which I have been talking about earlier on another podcast.

12
0:00:55,180 --> 0:01:03,960
 What I'm going to show you is some examples of automation gone wrong.

13
0:01:05,060 --> 0:01:10,160
 You are clever people, so you will be able to say for yourself,

14
0:01:10,720 --> 0:01:14,520
 there should be something else done here than automating.

15
0:01:15,540 --> 0:01:18,180
 Maybe not, but I'll give you some examples of it.

16
0:01:18,180 --> 0:01:23,600
 After I've been showing you these examples, then I will read a very long poem.

17
0:01:25,180 --> 0:01:32,580
 This paper is on two pages, so it's going to take a while and I'm going to try to do it on my not-very-fine English.

18
0:01:32,580 --> 0:01:36,260
 But I'll do it anyway, so you have to bear over with me.

19
0:01:36,760 --> 0:01:39,040
 We'll start with toilets.

20
0:01:40,420 --> 0:01:41,940
 If I can get this thing to work.

21
0:01:45,420 --> 0:01:49,940
 This is an automated toilet in a Danish city.

22
0:01:51,380 --> 0:01:54,340
 Inside this toilet was the...

23
0:01:55,180 --> 0:02:00,480
 The son of an employee from the Danish Data Protection Agency, actually.

24
0:02:00,480 --> 0:02:04,980
 He went in there to pee, the son, and he couldn't get out of there.

25
0:02:04,980 --> 0:02:11,220
 Because the door locked itself from the inside because of some fault.

26
0:02:11,220 --> 0:02:19,560
 The municipality said afterwards it was because the son had made some strange move around the door.

27
0:02:19,560 --> 0:02:22,060
 And then the system just locked down.

28
0:02:22,060 --> 0:02:24,060
 He was actually lucky.

29
0:02:24,060 --> 0:02:25,060
 Because the toilet was locked down.

30
0:02:25,060 --> 0:02:28,820
 And the toilet didn't start to clean itself, which it usually does.

31
0:02:28,820 --> 0:02:32,660
 There's some spray system inside and some sanitizer.

32
0:02:32,660 --> 0:02:37,260
 And it can kind of feel that there's a human inside.

33
0:02:37,260 --> 0:02:42,220
 So it didn't actually clean the kid that was seven years old inside.

34
0:02:42,220 --> 0:02:48,620
 But he had to stay there for 45 minutes, waiting for the municipality to arrive to get him out of there.

35
0:02:48,620 --> 0:02:50,620
 Because he was stuck in there.

36
0:02:50,620 --> 0:02:53,860
 And then you might say this is just one stupid example.

37
0:02:53,860 --> 0:02:54,860
 But it actually keeps him there.

38
0:02:54,860 --> 0:03:01,300
 And it keeps happening all over Denmark, that people are getting stuck in automated toilets.

39
0:03:01,300 --> 0:03:11,580
 One of the situations here is a very old woman here who was over 70 and was stuck inside this toilet for a long while.

40
0:03:11,580 --> 0:03:14,200
 She actually didn't have a mobile phone.

41
0:03:14,200 --> 0:03:15,280
 But she was lucky.

42
0:03:15,280 --> 0:03:16,760
 It was in the night.

43
0:03:16,760 --> 0:03:18,980
 It was freezing outside.

44
0:03:18,980 --> 0:03:23,540
 And she was lucky that she was with someone who noticed that she wasn't getting back and

45
0:03:23,540 --> 0:03:24,660
 who went to look for her.

46
0:03:24,860 --> 0:03:30,580
 And he had a mobile phone and was able to call the municipality, but she also had to stay

47
0:03:30,580 --> 0:03:35,740
 inside the toilet for about an hour before they let her out of there.

48
0:03:35,740 --> 0:03:39,480
 And she found it a very scary experience.

49
0:03:39,480 --> 0:03:43,020
 We also have another problem with toilets in Denmark.

50
0:03:43,020 --> 0:03:47,700
 People are not only automating toilets, but they're also making them pay toilets, which

51
0:03:47,700 --> 0:03:54,660
 is mostly happening at the Danish railroad stations, which is a place where a lot of people need to go to pee.

52
0:03:54,860 --> 0:03:58,480
 After they have been taking a train.

53
0:03:58,480 --> 0:04:01,540
 But the problem is that they are actually just shutting toilets down.

54
0:04:01,540 --> 0:04:03,680
 They're missing toilets now.

55
0:04:03,680 --> 0:04:06,660
 There are not enough toilets at Danish stations.

56
0:04:06,660 --> 0:04:11,540
 And if there are, you need to pay for them.

57
0:04:11,540 --> 0:04:17,160
 This is how a modern toilet could look, the one to the right over there.

58
0:04:17,160 --> 0:04:19,200
 It's getting very complicated.

59
0:04:19,200 --> 0:04:24,820
 The other one is the old model, the manualization model, where you actually leave some money

60
0:04:24,860 --> 0:04:29,280
 for a person who takes care of the toilet.

61
0:04:29,280 --> 0:04:33,920
 She might also be able to get you out if the door locks or something, but that's a possibility.

62
0:04:33,920 --> 0:04:39,640
 But we get more and more of these automated stuff like that over there.

63
0:04:39,640 --> 0:04:45,580
 This is from the Danish main railway station, where we got these pay toilets now.

64
0:04:45,580 --> 0:04:50,540
 And you need to cross through this kind of airport-looking security to be able to go

65
0:04:50,540 --> 0:04:54,480
 to the toilet, which I don't find very optimal in any way.

66
0:04:54,480 --> 0:05:03,400
 In Denmark, we generally are very, very happy about digitalization.

67
0:05:03,400 --> 0:05:08,480
 And if you need to talk to someone within the municipality or the state or something

68
0:05:08,480 --> 0:05:13,400
 like that, then you should go via computer, is the general opinion in many ways.

69
0:05:13,400 --> 0:05:15,180
 You need to go via name ID.

70
0:05:15,180 --> 0:05:17,260
 You can log on.

71
0:05:17,260 --> 0:05:20,600
 You can use a chat bot, or you can use a lot of other stuff.

72
0:05:20,600 --> 0:05:23,900
 And that's the way we kind of made our societies these days.

73
0:05:23,900 --> 0:05:33,020
 This might be good for some, but as I will get back to later, it's not good for everybody.

74
0:05:33,020 --> 0:05:41,020
 One of the problems is that computers are not always doing what we think they're going to do.

75
0:05:41,020 --> 0:05:46,940
 This is a quote by a guy called Philip E. Agra, which I can recommend everybody to read.

76
0:05:46,940 --> 0:05:53,700
 And he says that, in this sense, computing has constituted a kind of imperialism,

77
0:05:53,700 --> 0:06:04,020
 it claims to be, it aims to be, to reinvent virtually every other side of practically

78
0:06:04,020 --> 0:06:07,580
 in its own image, which is what it's doing.

79
0:06:07,580 --> 0:06:12,820
 One of the places we can see these images kind of seeping through currently is the new

80
0:06:12,820 --> 0:06:20,620
 citizen app from the Danish state that all Danes are supposed to use currently.

81
0:06:20,620 --> 0:06:21,700
 It's now called MyID.

82
0:06:21,700 --> 0:06:22,700
 It used to be called MyID.

83
0:06:22,700 --> 0:06:23,700
 It's now called MyID.

84
0:06:23,700 --> 0:06:31,940
 It's now called NimID, which translates like something like EasyID, and now MyID.

85
0:06:31,940 --> 0:06:38,100
 Before that, it used to have an analog component, this ID thing, which is used to log into every

86
0:06:38,100 --> 0:06:47,440
 kind of system that the state and the municipality uses, and to address a lot of functionality

87
0:06:47,440 --> 0:06:50,820
 you need in daily life.

88
0:06:50,820 --> 0:06:52,700
 But it used to have an analog component.

89
0:06:52,700 --> 0:06:56,480
 It used to have an analog component, which was a card, a paper card, I actually have

90
0:06:56,480 --> 0:07:00,520
 one with me too, which was called a key card.

91
0:07:00,520 --> 0:07:06,980
 You need to tap into one of these, I had one of these.

92
0:07:06,980 --> 0:07:09,200
 How many out there has them still?

93
0:07:09,200 --> 0:07:10,820
 Oh, nice.

94
0:07:10,820 --> 0:07:18,120
 I actually have a friend who kind of, he actually got 200 of them, just to be sure, which is

95
0:07:18,120 --> 0:07:19,120
 possible.

96
0:07:19,120 --> 0:07:20,700
 You can still go down to the municipality and say to them, I need 200.

97
0:07:20,700 --> 0:07:21,700
 You can still go down to the municipality and say to them, I need 200.

98
0:07:21,700 --> 0:07:22,700
 You can still go down to the municipality and say to them, I need 200.

99
0:07:22,700 --> 0:07:25,700
 One of my friends actually did a website app tower with this card showing how many

100
0:07:25,700 --> 0:07:29,120
 exactly, how manyoga you got.

101
0:07:29,120 --> 0:07:31,160
 This is really a pretty cool application.

102
0:07:31,160 --> 0:07:36,200
 You can see

103
0:07:36,200 --> 0:07:41,940
 how many of the objects, all about thousands, all about 4000 tree parties, all about 3000

104
0:07:41,940 --> 0:07:43,520
 trees in Windows.

105
0:07:43,520 --> 0:07:47,600
 Do you, like John and Tanya, you have a lot of advancements.

106
0:07:47,600 --> 0:07:48,640
 зах緊

107
0:07:48,640 --> 0:07:51,260
 Do you have any tips?

108
0:07:51,260 --> 0:07:52,260
 Let me know.

109
0:07:52,260 --> 0:07:57,180
 validate it your own ID via your passport which is kind of new so you

110
0:07:57,180 --> 0:08:01,500
 need to be absolutely sure who everybody is in this sense it's always been like

111
0:08:01,500 --> 0:08:06,180
 this but this count is coming automated you need the NFC reader to actually

112
0:08:06,180 --> 0:08:11,580
 activate this thing so you NFC read your passport to kind of say that you are who

113
0:08:11,580 --> 0:08:19,140
 you are so then you pull digital circle on this stuff there is an alternative

114
0:08:19,140 --> 0:08:24,600
 which is coming now there's only one this is this pretty ugly little thing

115
0:08:24,600 --> 0:08:29,380
 which I'm gonna order I think which is supposed to give some sort of numbers

116
0:08:29,380 --> 0:08:35,320
 out when you push it it's supposed to last for 10 years and it's probably just

117
0:08:35,320 --> 0:08:38,940
 as easy as having an app on your phone but that's the only thing you can use

118
0:08:38,940 --> 0:08:44,640
 instead of that and that is what is now the current key to all your services at

119
0:08:44,640 --> 0:08:49,140
 the day States or the municipality this little thing

120
0:08:49,140 --> 0:08:55,240
 then we have the problem because there are citizens in Denmark and there's

121
0:08:55,240 --> 0:08:59,900
 actually a lot of them who are non-digital there was a new report

122
0:08:59,900 --> 0:09:06,820
 currently from the digitalization agency which estimates that between 17 and 22

123
0:09:06,820 --> 0:09:14,480
 percent of the grown-up population are not what I call digitally threatened

124
0:09:14,480 --> 0:09:18,900
 because they don't master the digital lives

125
0:09:18,900 --> 0:09:19,120
 you

126
0:09:19,120 --> 0:09:24,700
 The really shocking thing about this report is that it is not only up to 22%.

127
0:09:24,700 --> 0:09:30,560
 They say that there might be even more because a lot of people are just getting by

128
0:09:30,560 --> 0:09:37,200
 because they're getting help from relatives or at the libraries or somewhere else.

129
0:09:37,920 --> 0:09:44,600
 So we can't actually be sure that it's only 22% who has got problems with living the digital life

130
0:09:44,600 --> 0:09:49,660
 and actually getting the services out of the country that they live in.

131
0:09:53,460 --> 0:09:55,980
 This is from this report.

132
0:09:56,880 --> 0:10:02,760
 The digitalization agency called it digital inclusion in the digital society,

133
0:10:02,940 --> 0:10:04,940
 so it can't get any more digital than that.

134
0:10:05,640 --> 0:10:11,600
 And they've hidden these examples of very bad things happening

135
0:10:11,600 --> 0:10:14,580
 if you are not able to cope with the digital.

136
0:10:14,600 --> 0:10:18,280
 There's a woman here who's old.

137
0:10:18,500 --> 0:10:24,720
 She's got a handicap, and she can't get her money out of the bank.

138
0:10:25,020 --> 0:10:26,780
 And I'll get back to that later.

139
0:10:27,000 --> 0:10:31,140
 That's partly because of money laundering laws and stuff like that

140
0:10:31,140 --> 0:10:33,960
 that kind of collide with the digital stuff.

141
0:10:34,600 --> 0:10:38,260
 But she can't get her own money out.

142
0:10:38,260 --> 0:10:44,340
 She needs to go to the bank, but she only has to use the...

143
0:10:44,340 --> 0:10:44,960
 The automates.

144
0:10:45,000 --> 0:10:49,520
 She can't go inside the bank because the bank has closed the cash registers.

145
0:10:49,680 --> 0:10:53,440
 You can't now go to the bank with your bank card and say,

146
0:10:53,580 --> 0:10:55,720
 I want all my money in cash.

147
0:10:56,000 --> 0:10:57,060
 It's not possible.

148
0:10:57,380 --> 0:10:58,160
 They've closed it.

149
0:10:58,680 --> 0:11:05,540
 And if you are a weak person who usually take out all their money on the first of the months,

150
0:11:06,040 --> 0:11:07,460
 then that's not possible anymore.

151
0:11:07,460 --> 0:11:10,540
 You can only get 2,000 kroners at a time.

152
0:11:11,560 --> 0:11:14,000
 And that will give some other problems that I will get back to.

153
0:11:14,340 --> 0:11:19,780
 And this situation is absolutely crazy because she needs help to go to the bank.

154
0:11:20,120 --> 0:11:25,180
 And she needs to take a taxi every time because she can't use the public transportation.

155
0:11:25,980 --> 0:11:30,760
 And that costs her 500 and 600 kroners per time she needs to get money.

156
0:11:31,500 --> 0:11:33,780
 So that's not a very ideal situation.

157
0:11:34,820 --> 0:11:37,740
 Then we've got people who say that, well, they do have smartphones.

158
0:11:37,740 --> 0:11:41,220
 They actually work around this stuff in general.

159
0:11:41,460 --> 0:11:43,740
 But there's a lot of people who...

160
0:11:44,340 --> 0:11:50,980
 I don't know, we just heard a talk before about people who are getting tracked on their mobile phones

161
0:11:50,980 --> 0:11:55,740
 because they, you know, go or have newsletters or things like that.

162
0:11:56,120 --> 0:12:00,560
 But it's also a lot of people just push buttons on their phones

163
0:12:00,560 --> 0:12:02,980
 and they don't understand what is happening out there.

164
0:12:03,360 --> 0:12:08,040
 And then all of a sudden, especially they also typically have cheap phones

165
0:12:08,040 --> 0:12:13,360
 and they get cloaked with viruses and ads and stuff like that.

166
0:12:13,420 --> 0:12:14,320
 And they simply stop.

167
0:12:14,340 --> 0:12:19,820
 And if you combine this stuff with having to handle your own money

168
0:12:19,820 --> 0:12:27,200
 and generally going around your daily life in modern society on a digital basis

169
0:12:27,200 --> 0:12:32,600
 with a phone that is totally cloaked up with viruses and ads and not really working,

170
0:12:32,720 --> 0:12:35,240
 we have a pretty difficult situation.

171
0:12:37,380 --> 0:12:43,320
 As this thing says, people have 400 unread mails in their mail folder.

172
0:12:43,320 --> 0:12:44,220
 So they can't really...

173
0:12:44,340 --> 0:12:46,920
 If there's something new pops up, they don't really notice.

174
0:12:47,820 --> 0:12:51,900
 Which can get very disastrous if it's something important.

175
0:12:52,840 --> 0:12:56,320
 Then we got a very problem because we got people who are living on the streets

176
0:12:56,320 --> 0:12:57,640
 who don't have a home.

177
0:12:58,060 --> 0:13:04,160
 Homeless people, because the banks won't give them the possibility of going to the bank,

178
0:13:04,360 --> 0:13:07,580
 showing some sort of identification and taking their money out,

179
0:13:08,040 --> 0:13:10,140
 but they need to have a credit card.

180
0:13:10,140 --> 0:13:13,900
 Then they can't get their money, some of them.

181
0:13:14,340 --> 0:13:19,160
 The possibility of going inside the bank was closed down in November last year.

182
0:13:19,660 --> 0:13:23,160
 The politician had been warned a long time by the homeless organization

183
0:13:23,160 --> 0:13:26,220
 that this is going to be a problem, but nobody reacted.

184
0:13:27,060 --> 0:13:27,880
 Nothing happened.

185
0:13:28,440 --> 0:13:33,820
 It ended up being the homeless organizations who needed to take some sort of steps to do it themselves.

186
0:13:34,320 --> 0:13:40,720
 So they kind of made a call-in service where you could meet up at a homeless station

187
0:13:40,720 --> 0:13:44,000
 and then you could say, I need so and so much money.

188
0:13:44,340 --> 0:13:49,520
 Then they made a special deal with one bank who on this special occasion said,

189
0:13:49,760 --> 0:13:54,140
 then we can take out a lot of money to these people, then you have to distribute them.

190
0:13:54,200 --> 0:13:57,340
 And we don't want them inside the banks, these people.

191
0:13:58,380 --> 0:13:59,600
 So they don't come there.

192
0:13:59,840 --> 0:14:02,420
 And there are a lot of people currently who don't get their money

193
0:14:02,420 --> 0:14:06,100
 that they're actually entitled to because they can't get them out.

194
0:14:06,660 --> 0:14:10,240
 There are also people, then you could say, why don't they have a credit card?

195
0:14:10,660 --> 0:14:12,200
 Mainly because they don't have an address.

196
0:14:13,060 --> 0:14:14,260
 You can't get a credit card.

197
0:14:14,340 --> 0:14:16,700
 Without an address in some ways.

198
0:14:16,800 --> 0:14:20,800
 Then if they have a credit card, if you're homeless and you drink

199
0:14:20,800 --> 0:14:27,300
 and you generally have a loose life, then it's a lot of problems trying to hang on to a credit card.

200
0:14:27,300 --> 0:14:31,640
 Even more to remember a four-digit code or even worse,

201
0:14:31,760 --> 0:14:37,640
 trying to log in and out with MID-ID or NEM-ID, which also requires different kinds of codes.

202
0:14:37,780 --> 0:14:41,100
 It actually, it's almost impossible for these people to do anything.

203
0:14:41,660 --> 0:14:43,660
 So the homeless organizations are actually,

204
0:14:43,660 --> 0:14:49,760
 we're talking about now that a lot of these people are turning to criminality or prostitution to get money

205
0:14:49,760 --> 0:14:54,060
 because they've simply given up of getting them out of the system

206
0:14:54,060 --> 0:14:56,580
 who's actually promised to give them money every month.

207
0:14:56,880 --> 0:14:57,780
 They can't get them.

208
0:14:58,080 --> 0:15:03,200
 But it's a good deal for the state because they don't have to pay out so much money that they used to do.

209
0:15:05,600 --> 0:15:08,860
 They actually made, the homeless organization actually made a suggestion.

210
0:15:09,700 --> 0:15:11,680
 In Denmark, it's called BOA, foreslay.

211
0:15:12,340 --> 0:15:13,280
 There's a possibility.

212
0:15:13,660 --> 0:15:19,300
 It's where you can kind of come with a suggestion to the parliament

213
0:15:19,300 --> 0:15:21,480
 and say you should make this to law.

214
0:15:22,200 --> 0:15:27,400
 But it has been running for some while and they said everybody has the right to their own money

215
0:15:27,400 --> 0:15:31,380
 and they want a kind of guarantee for that.

216
0:15:32,300 --> 0:15:36,660
 But they don't have many signatures and I don't think it will get through.

217
0:15:36,860 --> 0:15:40,480
 And should it even have the amount of signatures to make the parliament take it seriously,

218
0:15:40,980 --> 0:15:42,580
 then I don't think anything will happen.

219
0:15:42,580 --> 0:15:43,580
 They're not going to do anything.

220
0:15:43,660 --> 0:15:44,280
 They're not going to do anything about it.

221
0:15:45,900 --> 0:15:47,200
 We have our prime minister.

222
0:15:47,360 --> 0:15:52,480
 She said recently there was 25 years of, what do you call it,

223
0:15:52,540 --> 0:15:57,160
 25 years of anniversary for some of the homeless organizations

224
0:15:57,160 --> 0:16:01,960
 and then all the politicians kind of gave interviews and also the prime minister

225
0:16:01,960 --> 0:16:04,700
 about what they are going to do about the homeless problem.

226
0:16:05,600 --> 0:16:11,860
 And our prime minister said her main attack mode for the homeless problem was saying

227
0:16:11,860 --> 0:16:13,640
 we can't help them.

228
0:16:13,660 --> 0:16:17,080
 We can't help them because we have all these homeless people from other countries

229
0:16:17,080 --> 0:16:21,720
 who are coming into Denmark and we don't want to lift that burden for the other countries

230
0:16:21,720 --> 0:16:22,580
 within the EU.

231
0:16:23,180 --> 0:16:24,340
 So we're not going to do much.

232
0:16:24,580 --> 0:16:30,820
 But one thing she wanted to do something about was the problem with violence against homeless people

233
0:16:30,820 --> 0:16:33,800
 that they are getting mocked on the streets.

234
0:16:34,580 --> 0:16:38,980
 And she said that really harms me that people could mock a homeless person.

235
0:16:39,120 --> 0:16:41,100
 So that makes me very furious.

236
0:16:41,700 --> 0:16:43,060
 And what was her solution?

237
0:16:43,060 --> 0:16:43,560
 So this problem.

238
0:16:43,560 --> 0:16:49,360
 She says we need more surveillance on the streets so we can see these people,

239
0:16:49,520 --> 0:16:56,260
 what is going on, so maybe these violent people will think again before they kind of attack

240
0:16:56,260 --> 0:17:00,440
 a homeless person and then it will be easier for the police to catch them afterwards.

241
0:17:01,280 --> 0:17:05,780
 That was the only thing she offered for these people, more surveillance.

242
0:17:05,980 --> 0:17:10,120
 And that's the general tone of the Danish system currently.

243
0:17:10,120 --> 0:17:19,620
 This is a quote from a guy called Philip Alston who is a special rapporteur for UN who talked

244
0:17:19,620 --> 0:17:26,840
 about the digital welfare state and he mentions that the main thing about the digital welfare

245
0:17:26,840 --> 0:17:32,580
 state, could you be quiet down there, sorry, I'm getting a bit, sorry, it's distracting.

246
0:17:33,080 --> 0:17:39,920
 But Philip Alston talked about that the digital welfare state has needs

247
0:17:39,920 --> 0:17:46,080
 to have goals to make lives better for people.

248
0:17:46,720 --> 0:17:48,400
 That should be the main thing.

249
0:17:49,120 --> 0:17:54,420
 But he sees in general all over the place that it's being used to control people

250
0:17:54,820 --> 0:17:58,040
 and to make a registration and to surveil people.

251
0:17:59,000 --> 0:18:05,280
 And we can actually, we can risk making what he calls a digital welfare dystopia.

252
0:18:06,140 --> 0:18:09,280
 And I think we are pretty close to that in Denmark currently.

253
0:18:09,280 --> 0:18:09,920
 That's something that we need to do.

254
0:18:09,920 --> 0:18:14,120
 And that's partly because of automation, which I will get back to again in a little while.

255
0:18:17,840 --> 0:18:23,480
 This is, for example, the possibility, we all have this smartphone, which is getting more and more.

256
0:18:23,740 --> 0:18:24,800
 We need it more and more.

257
0:18:24,800 --> 0:18:27,360
 We need to log in all the time.

258
0:18:27,360 --> 0:18:29,600
 We need to have corona passports.

259
0:18:30,060 --> 0:18:36,820
 We need to use it to go on the bank and we need it for our train tickets and stuff like that.

260
0:18:37,480 --> 0:18:39,280
 It needs to be all over the place.

261
0:18:39,280 --> 0:18:45,260
 And the main problem with that is that the states in Denmark loves data retention.

262
0:18:45,780 --> 0:18:53,200
 We have currently had a data retention law, meaning that everything, everybody you are calling

263
0:18:53,200 --> 0:18:58,960
 and who is calling you and who you are SMSing and who is SMSing you, that is being stored

264
0:18:58,960 --> 0:19:02,920
 for a year and also your location.

265
0:19:04,000 --> 0:19:07,160
 That is against the rules of the EU.

266
0:19:07,160 --> 0:19:09,160
 And there has been several laws.

267
0:19:09,280 --> 0:19:15,500
 There are large cases there saying that Denmark should stop this immediately, which we have ignored.

268
0:19:15,500 --> 0:19:18,040
 Our politician has ignored that for seven years.

269
0:19:18,460 --> 0:19:28,700
 Recently, there was an organization tried to sue the Danish state, but didn't really win.

270
0:19:28,700 --> 0:19:30,220
 It has now been appealed.

271
0:19:30,840 --> 0:19:37,060
 But what is clear is that the current method of data retention is illegal, and we can't continue that.

272
0:19:37,460 --> 0:19:38,900
 But our prime minister.

273
0:19:39,280 --> 0:19:47,160
 Who is a very ingenious man, has already a new law on the way, which then afterwards the EU can say that it's illegal.

274
0:19:47,160 --> 0:19:51,200
 That will take some years and while they're waiting for that, this will continue.

275
0:19:51,200 --> 0:19:58,040
 He now wants our phones to be registered every five minutes.

276
0:19:58,780 --> 0:20:01,040
 Also phones that are not being used.

277
0:20:01,040 --> 0:20:07,200
 Just the time they ping the network, it will be registered and that should be stored for a year.

278
0:20:07,200 --> 0:20:09,120
 That's what in the new proposal for the EU.

279
0:20:09,120 --> 0:20:18,420
 The new data retention law here in Denmark, and we say something about how they are generally how the state sees the citizens as data subjects.

280
0:20:19,800 --> 0:20:22,260
 You also you can also get just get used to it.

281
0:20:22,260 --> 0:20:27,880
 If you want to get through the train, you will be you're already being filmed by CCTV at the train.

282
0:20:28,740 --> 0:20:38,960
 But if you are getting it, if a controller or a conductor comes to check your your tickets, then he will have a body cam on.

283
0:20:38,960 --> 0:20:47,200
 So you will also be if you will be double films, it's only an experiment currently, but if you don't really, but it will probably become permanent.

284
0:20:48,460 --> 0:20:53,420
 And then we got our minister of justice, which is this guy.

285
0:20:55,920 --> 0:20:59,920
 He will be saying something, but I think we'll just skip the video because you're not on really on.

286
0:20:59,920 --> 0:21:06,880
 And some of you out there know, but all of us, I will just kind of sum up what he says on this video clip, which will be in Danish.

287
0:21:07,380 --> 0:21:08,280
 He says that surveillance.

288
0:21:08,960 --> 0:21:19,040
 Is freedom because the citizens needs to be safe to be free, and we can only be free if we have surveillance.

289
0:21:19,840 --> 0:21:21,440
 So surveillance is freedom.

290
0:21:22,580 --> 0:21:24,980
 Does that sound a bit like 1984 to you?

291
0:21:24,980 --> 0:21:27,740
 It does to me, but he doesn't seem bothered.

292
0:21:28,460 --> 0:21:35,240
 It's he he's he's actually been repeating it all over the place of he's been mocked by privacy people, but he keeps repeating it.

293
0:21:38,960 --> 0:21:42,180
 So we are free.

294
0:21:42,180 --> 0:21:46,260
 Indeed, in Denmark, we are free to be more read even in more registers.

295
0:21:46,260 --> 0:21:51,660
 We have a national genome center, which is also working kind of automatic.

296
0:21:52,160 --> 0:22:02,880
 If you've been tested positive for COVID-19, your DNA data is now in the Danish database, the National Genome Center, and you can't delete it.

297
0:22:02,880 --> 0:22:05,540
 It will be there until ten years after your death.

298
0:22:07,080 --> 0:22:07,580
 Yes.

299
0:22:08,960 --> 0:22:15,140
 Not only did you get tested positive, and so I think you've undergone the test to see if you have been tested positive or not.

300
0:22:15,140 --> 0:22:15,640
 Okay.

301
0:22:15,640 --> 0:22:24,140
 And you can write to see if you've been tested positive or not.

302
0:22:24,140 --> 0:22:27,380
 Yes, I'll just repeat so everybody can hear.

303
0:22:27,380 --> 0:22:29,640
 He says it's not just when you've been tested positive.

304
0:22:29,640 --> 0:22:38,940
 You actually need to go into the Danish, I think it's called biobank, and to write them and say explicitly that you want some of your data is deleted.

305
0:22:38,960 --> 0:22:41,200
 And they're not allowed to keep them.

306
0:22:41,200 --> 0:22:43,520
 Then it should be possible to get rid of them.

307
0:22:43,520 --> 0:22:44,740
 Otherwise, they'll just store them.

308
0:22:44,740 --> 0:22:51,980
 It is pretty, it's not easy to find the right formula, but it is somewhere inside the system.

309
0:22:51,980 --> 0:22:55,060
 But if you get tested positive, it doesn't matter what you've written.

310
0:22:55,060 --> 0:22:55,780
 Then it is there.

311
0:22:55,780 --> 0:22:57,980
 You can't get rid of that stuff.

312
0:22:57,980 --> 0:23:03,040
 And now we also, we have this National Genome Center, which is supposed to be used to science.

313
0:23:03,040 --> 0:23:08,140
 The idea here is to store as many Danish DNA data as possible.

314
0:23:08,140 --> 0:23:08,440
 Yes.

315
0:23:08,440 --> 0:23:11,940
 And DNA sequences as possible.

316
0:23:11,940 --> 0:23:23,920
 And now they're also using what they call the Danish church books, which is an old analog system for registering births and people who are being born and married and stuff like that.

317
0:23:23,920 --> 0:23:36,120
 They want to digitize these three generations back so you can actually combine the DNA information on that time, which is unprecedented in many ways.

318
0:23:36,120 --> 0:23:37,740
 And it kind of borders on.

319
0:23:37,740 --> 0:23:38,220
 Yes.

320
0:23:38,220 --> 0:23:56,580
 And it kind of borders on menial acts as science, in my opinion, because you will actually be able to look back in families and say, and the meaning of this system is that you can go back into these two families and say, where does this disease start or how does this social derude start?

321
0:23:57,420 --> 0:24:00,880
 And then you can kind of look, oh, this family is really bad.

322
0:24:01,640 --> 0:24:03,640
 And what they're going to use these days, I don't know.

323
0:24:03,640 --> 0:24:07,980
 It's currently science, but there's a lot of possibilities and not all of them.

324
0:24:08,220 --> 0:24:12,000
 So it's kind of nice to take it, to put it very shortly.

325
0:24:13,380 --> 0:24:14,920
 Then we got another problem.

326
0:24:15,500 --> 0:24:24,940
 One of the things they're going to use for this genome sequences and for to digitize these old church book is artificial intelligence.

327
0:24:25,100 --> 0:24:32,580
 They want to train artificial intelligence to actually look into these data and to read what was written on this stuff.

328
0:24:32,580 --> 0:24:37,320
 But the main problem with artificial intelligence is it needs a hell of a lot of energy.

329
0:24:37,320 --> 0:24:42,760
 Every time you have to do this, and we are in a climate crisis, and we should actually think about what we're using it for.

330
0:24:43,420 --> 0:24:46,800
 And we also have a general problem with the chip industry.

331
0:24:48,300 --> 0:24:59,540
 One thing is that all of you may know there's a chip shortage currently, but we also have very, very rising energy cost of both producing them and running them.

332
0:24:59,540 --> 0:25:06,540
 In 2030, they expect that computing technology will be using 20%.

333
0:25:07,320 --> 0:25:15,960
 And that's going to be a very, very high cost of the global energy demand, which is more than the car industry, and the main the main consumption partner is producing chips.

334
0:25:16,740 --> 0:25:27,360
 And then we don't even talk about the enormous amounts of clear, clean water you need to produce this stuff, which is not going into this accountants here.

335
0:25:28,200 --> 0:25:29,280
 So we've got a problem there.

336
0:25:30,240 --> 0:25:34,020
 And as you see, we all know we have a chip problem currently.

337
0:25:35,280 --> 0:25:37,100
 Toyota can't.

338
0:25:37,320 --> 0:25:39,300
 Put up all the cars that may be a good thing.

339
0:25:39,300 --> 0:25:43,020
 Then we have fewer cars on the road, but they might also be electric.

340
0:25:43,020 --> 0:25:45,180
 So that's not a problem.

341
0:25:45,480 --> 0:25:50,600
 They caught output for 40% because they can't get chips currently.

342
0:25:52,380 --> 0:26:06,720
 I've got one more example here, which is a guy called Sadina, or as it's called, Maury Morandit, who has been staying at an island called Buduli for 32 years.

343
0:26:07,320 --> 0:26:12,420
 And he's been guarding it as he was known as the Robinson Crusoe of Europe.

344
0:26:12,420 --> 0:26:24,560
 He lived alone on a very lonely island, guarding it for the tourists that came around and been looking after it for a long time and had it as a fine job.

345
0:26:24,680 --> 0:26:32,940
 Then the state initially cut away his job and said he couldn't do it anymore and sent him back to the mainland.

346
0:26:33,680 --> 0:26:37,300
 And now they substituted him with CCTV cameras.

347
0:26:37,800 --> 0:26:40,280
 Which is supposed to look after the island.

348
0:26:40,560 --> 0:26:42,440
 And he says it's a disaster.

349
0:26:42,880 --> 0:26:44,660
 The beast is getting trampled on.

350
0:26:44,880 --> 0:26:46,100
 I knew this would happen.

351
0:26:46,100 --> 0:26:51,360
 There's nobody anymore to educate the tourists, which is part of this.

352
0:26:54,460 --> 0:27:00,260
 This is something we can actually run without having any sound on it because it's nice.

353
0:27:00,380 --> 0:27:06,640
 And then I can actually maybe run it before I read this very long poem that will end this.

354
0:27:07,320 --> 0:27:08,620
 Strange session.

355
0:27:10,340 --> 0:27:16,700
 This is people who have actually manualized stuff in a very simple way.

356
0:27:17,940 --> 0:27:29,640
 This is a guy who, or not a guy, several guys who are going to reconstruct a car radiator in India.

357
0:27:30,120 --> 0:27:30,820
 It's broken.

358
0:27:31,000 --> 0:27:31,920
 It's leaking water.

359
0:27:32,440 --> 0:27:36,220
 And you can watch it maybe while I'm reading this very long poem.

360
0:27:37,320 --> 0:27:44,200
 It's about being an analogist, which I have been practicing to say because it's hard in English.

361
0:27:46,040 --> 0:27:53,580
 I'm an analogist because the world is analog and the world is analog because everyday life is not digital.

362
0:27:53,900 --> 0:28:05,040
 Even though they say so at the digitalization agency and in the prime minister's office and at IBM and Google and Facebook and in the parliament and television all the time.

363
0:28:05,040 --> 0:28:07,040
 Or maybe just because they say it.

364
0:28:07,320 --> 0:28:22,200
 Without knowing what it really means and every time they say the world gets a little bit more boring leaves fall off the trees, children crash on bikes and therefore I am an analogist for course, it is not boring.

365
0:28:23,500 --> 0:28:33,000
 I'm an analogist because I once fell off a motorcycle and broke my collarbone and experienced the pain of breaking a little and never really growing back together again.

366
0:28:33,000 --> 0:28:36,940
 And that was a very little digital and very analog experience.

367
0:28:36,940 --> 0:28:38,940
 Because my body is analog.

368
0:28:38,940 --> 0:28:44,940
 Analog with yours and at the same time my own and therefore I am an analogist.

369
0:28:44,940 --> 0:28:50,940
 I'm an analogist because I have disassembled more machines than I have reassembled.

370
0:28:50,940 --> 0:28:58,940
 With screwdrivers I've reduced a meaningful working Remington typewriter to hundreds of meaningless parts.

371
0:28:58,940 --> 0:29:00,940
 Parts that could not be reassembled.

372
0:29:00,940 --> 0:29:04,940
 I turned something working into a dataistic amount of springs and screws and metal.

373
0:29:04,940 --> 0:29:06,940
 I turned something working into a dataistic amount of springs and screws and metal.

374
0:29:06,940 --> 0:29:08,940
 I turned something working into a dataistic amount of springs and screws and metal.

375
0:29:08,940 --> 0:29:12,880
 I turned something working into a dataistic amount of springs and more metal rods and keys whose inner meaning I had succeeded in extinguishing.

376
0:29:13,880 --> 0:29:21,740
 As one blows out a candle all movement frozen in the theater of the detest springs quivering.

377
0:29:22,660 --> 0:29:22,740
 As one blows out a candle all movement frozen in the theater of the detest springs quivering.

378
0:29:22,740 --> 0:29:28,620
 I'm an analogist because I have changed my own RAM blocks and harddrives in computers

379
0:29:28,620 --> 0:29:36,620
 and because I know that even the computer is concrete and understandable and actually analog in its very own way.

380
0:29:36,620 --> 0:29:36,740
 And because I know that even the computer is concrete and understandable and actually analog in its very own way.

381
0:29:36,940 --> 0:29:39,820
 and at least not digital in itself,

382
0:29:39,820 --> 0:29:44,000
 and not at all digital in weekdays that are digital,

383
0:29:44,000 --> 0:29:49,000
 not at all as a bearer of a special magical digital force,

384
0:29:49,240 --> 0:29:52,120
 not at all as anything but a tool,

385
0:29:52,120 --> 0:29:56,100
 a screwdriver that can disassemble everything digital

386
0:29:56,100 --> 0:29:59,880
 into completely meaningless ones and zeros,

387
0:29:59,880 --> 0:30:02,840
 and therefore I am analogist.

388
0:30:02,840 --> 0:30:07,320
 I'm an analogist because I'm afraid of the internet,

389
0:30:07,320 --> 0:30:10,920
 now that it's clearly ruled by money and politics

390
0:30:10,920 --> 0:30:14,520
 and manipulators and military and mastodons,

391
0:30:14,520 --> 0:30:17,780
 and because the internet has gone from exciting

392
0:30:17,780 --> 0:30:21,320
 to a straitjacket, a place we need to be

393
0:30:21,320 --> 0:30:23,980
 in order to could be at all,

394
0:30:23,980 --> 0:30:26,120
 and that is not how it should be,

395
0:30:26,120 --> 0:30:29,180
 and that is why I am an analogist.

396
0:30:29,180 --> 0:30:32,820
 I'm an analogist because digital is binary,

397
0:30:32,820 --> 0:30:35,680
 and I'm not, and neither are you,

398
0:30:35,680 --> 0:30:39,660
 and that's why you are also analogists.

399
0:30:39,660 --> 0:30:43,900
 I'm an analogist because analogy is sustainable,

400
0:30:43,900 --> 0:30:47,900
 because the analog is, because it already exists,

401
0:30:47,900 --> 0:30:51,300
 and because it does not need power or silicon chips

402
0:30:51,300 --> 0:30:54,680
 or burning server parks, feeding off rotating,

403
0:30:54,680 --> 0:30:57,920
 well-meaning wind turbines that can no longer

404
0:30:57,920 --> 0:31:01,580
 even be fought against, and that has now lost all meaning,

405
0:31:01,580 --> 0:31:02,300
 and therefore I am an analogist.

406
0:31:02,300 --> 0:31:07,300
 I am an analogist because digital is a trap

407
0:31:08,120 --> 0:31:12,060
 we made for ourselves, a nice lake with a bottom

408
0:31:12,060 --> 0:31:15,980
 of quicksand, and I see most of us already standing

409
0:31:15,980 --> 0:31:20,140
 in water to our throats, and we keep our phone screens

410
0:31:20,140 --> 0:31:24,540
 above us as if it was a life jacket, but it is not,

411
0:31:24,540 --> 0:31:27,320
 and therefore I am an analogist.

412
0:31:27,320 --> 0:31:30,000
 I'm an analogist because there's a spider

413
0:31:30,000 --> 0:31:32,220
 in the corner of this greenhouse,

414
0:31:32,220 --> 0:31:35,220
 that has made a web shape like a pyramid,

415
0:31:35,220 --> 0:31:38,740
 and it makes it more and more solid with each passing day,

416
0:31:38,740 --> 0:31:43,000
 and flies fall into it and sit stuck and get eaten,

417
0:31:43,000 --> 0:31:46,860
 mostly because the spider gets upset that the flies

418
0:31:46,860 --> 0:31:49,980
 are destroying the web and wants them to stop it.

419
0:31:49,980 --> 0:31:54,460
 Stop it now, and that is where nothing digital about this,

420
0:31:54,460 --> 0:31:57,640
 and that is why I am an analogist.

421
0:31:57,640 --> 0:32:00,340
 I'm an analogist because I like to stretch my eyes,

422
0:32:00,340 --> 0:32:02,060
 to look far beyond, and that is the reason I am an analogist,

423
0:32:02,060 --> 0:32:06,020
 or in the landscape or over the sea and the boat that is out there,

424
0:32:06,360 --> 0:32:07,860
 the boat that we all sit in.

425
0:32:08,140 --> 0:32:10,540
 And because we all sit there and are together,

426
0:32:10,820 --> 0:32:15,620
 and because I can still, with a bursting gaze, see it and see you,

427
0:32:15,940 --> 0:32:17,080
 I'm an analogist.

428
0:32:18,020 --> 0:32:22,240
 I'm an analogist because I once thought everything would be better

429
0:32:22,240 --> 0:32:24,840
 if we got computers and internet everywhere,

430
0:32:25,300 --> 0:32:27,340
 but we did, and it did not.

431
0:32:28,480 --> 0:32:30,480
 And that's why I'm an analogist.

432
0:32:30,480 --> 0:32:35,260
 I'm an analogist because I love good technology and good machines

433
0:32:35,260 --> 0:32:37,680
 that help us become better people,

434
0:32:38,020 --> 0:32:42,700
 but digitalization makes us better machines that have to operate other machines,

435
0:32:43,200 --> 0:32:45,720
 and thus we lose meaning as humans

436
0:32:45,720 --> 0:32:50,000
 and are left behind as sifting, indifferent ectoplasm

437
0:32:50,000 --> 0:32:55,320
 that swings around on sofas and has to go to gyms with our Apple Watches

438
0:32:55,320 --> 0:32:59,720
 and apps to get a solid physical shape for just one moment,

439
0:32:59,720 --> 0:33:00,460
 just one moment.

440
0:33:00,460 --> 0:33:00,480
 Just one moment.

441
0:33:00,480 --> 0:33:03,940
 Just once in a while, and that's probably not the point of it all,

442
0:33:04,100 --> 0:33:06,000
 and that's why I'm an analogist.

443
0:33:06,920 --> 0:33:10,560
 I'm an analogist because I think blueberries and blackberries

444
0:33:10,560 --> 0:33:14,040
 and raspberries and strawberries and butterflies and insects

445
0:33:14,040 --> 0:33:19,460
 and fish and cows and cats are more important than Aula and Nemity

446
0:33:19,460 --> 0:33:21,440
 and U.I.s and Google.

447
0:33:22,460 --> 0:33:26,640
 Because we already have a universe around us that calls for reflection

448
0:33:26,640 --> 0:33:30,460
 and humility that there's no room for on either internet

449
0:33:30,460 --> 0:33:33,780
 or Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, or Clubhouse.

450
0:33:33,780 --> 0:33:37,620
 We do not need an artificial universe in the screens,

451
0:33:37,620 --> 0:33:39,780
 and not at all as the favorite universe,

452
0:33:39,780 --> 0:33:42,860
 because when it does become our favorite universe,

453
0:33:42,860 --> 0:33:47,860
 reality collapses around our ears in a long, squeaky bang,

454
0:33:48,540 --> 0:33:51,460
 and therefore I'm an analogist.

455
0:33:51,460 --> 0:33:54,920
 I'm an analogist because there's a concrete reality

456
0:33:54,920 --> 0:33:59,220
 that we can all participate in and have a responsibility for,

457
0:33:59,220 --> 0:34:00,440
 and because the screens are not the same,

458
0:34:00,440 --> 0:34:03,440
 the screens are mosquito lights that lure us into flames

459
0:34:03,440 --> 0:34:07,420
 that take our wings away from us, and we have to fly.

460
0:34:07,820 --> 0:34:10,880
 We have to, and therefore I'm an analogist.

461
0:34:11,560 --> 0:34:15,060
 I'm an analogist because the computer is a prison

462
0:34:15,060 --> 0:34:19,940
 where the bars are retina screens and our eyelids are the prison itself,

463
0:34:20,320 --> 0:34:23,840
 and because the computer saves everything about us,

464
0:34:24,060 --> 0:34:27,000
 and because there are people and governments and companies

465
0:34:27,000 --> 0:34:30,000
 that will use us, and all our now written-down mistakes

466
0:34:30,440 --> 0:34:33,440
 against us, and that had not been written down

467
0:34:33,440 --> 0:34:37,160
 and stored on servers forever, they were not faulty at all.

468
0:34:37,160 --> 0:34:39,560
 They were forgotten now, but...

469
0:34:39,560 --> 0:34:42,020
 Now, but everything is remembered,

470
0:34:42,020 --> 0:34:44,520
 and therefore I'm an analogist.

471
0:34:44,520 --> 0:34:46,700
 I'm an analogist because artificial intelligence

472
0:34:46,700 --> 0:34:49,760
 is artificial and never gets wise,

473
0:34:50,760 --> 0:34:52,200
 and because artificial intelligence

474
0:34:52,200 --> 0:34:55,460
 makes us all average citizens who are made from

475
0:34:55,460 --> 0:35:00,440
 and made to fit into algorithms, and because artificial

476
0:35:00,440 --> 0:35:05,440
 intelligence is stupid enough to want to end up wanting to rule over us,

477
0:35:05,440 --> 0:35:10,780
 to decide because it pays homage to the mediocre, the predictable,

478
0:35:11,340 --> 0:35:15,100
 and because we humans will have to adapt accordingly,

479
0:35:15,620 --> 0:35:19,120
 and we are not average, and we are not predictable by nature,

480
0:35:19,400 --> 0:35:21,440
 and that's why I'm an analogist.

481
0:35:22,080 --> 0:35:26,240
 I am an analogist because I believe in the analog rights,

482
0:35:26,240 --> 0:35:31,380
 that we must be able to be here on this planet as human beings

483
0:35:31,380 --> 0:35:36,700
 without being wrapped up in a cloud of data, without internet, without telephones,

484
0:35:37,120 --> 0:35:42,660
 and that is important that we can do that because otherwise we are no longer real people,

485
0:35:43,260 --> 0:35:48,920
 but just a pendant to a very large machine that we have no control over,

486
0:35:49,140 --> 0:35:54,900
 and therefore I'm an analogist also on your behalf because you are also analog,

487
0:35:54,900 --> 0:35:56,160
 and I want you.

488
0:35:56,240 --> 0:36:00,020
 I want you the very best because I also love you as I love myself,

489
0:36:00,420 --> 0:36:03,320
 and that's a lot, and therefore I'm an analogist.

490
0:36:04,040 --> 0:36:10,560
 I'm an analogist because you exist, because every line and every scar on your body is real,

491
0:36:10,920 --> 0:36:15,800
 and because your face is reflected in everything but the screen in my eyes,

492
0:36:15,840 --> 0:36:18,900
 you are here, and you are human, and you are beautiful,

493
0:36:19,280 --> 0:36:21,440
 and therefore I'm an analogist.

494
0:36:21,440 --> 0:36:24,160
 Because humans are beautiful.

495
0:36:24,820 --> 0:36:26,220
 Because you are.

496
0:36:26,240 --> 0:36:37,400
 Thank you.

497
0:36:37,400 --> 0:36:54,100
 Yes, it's with regard of this church register you were talking about.

498
0:36:54,840 --> 0:36:56,200
 So, it's not...

499
0:36:56,320 --> 0:37:00,000
 It's not only people who are religious in Denmark who are in this register,

500
0:37:00,000 --> 0:37:03,800
 it's everybody who lives in Denmark because I wanted to change my name,

501
0:37:03,800 --> 0:37:07,000
 and even though I'm not part of the Danish church whatsoever,

502
0:37:07,000 --> 0:37:11,680
 I had to ask those people to change my name, which is something that's a bit what?

503
0:37:11,680 --> 0:37:15,000
 Why should the church have to do anything with my name to do right?

504
0:37:15,000 --> 0:37:19,280
 So, it's important to mention that it's every single Danish citizen that lives in Denmark

505
0:37:19,280 --> 0:37:25,460
 that is part of that register, and if they combine those two registers, we are in a big problem, right?

506
0:37:25,460 --> 0:37:25,560
 Yeah.

507
0:37:25,560 --> 0:37:25,600
 Yeah.

508
0:37:25,600 --> 0:37:25,640
 Yeah.

509
0:37:25,640 --> 0:37:25,680
 Yeah.

510
0:37:25,680 --> 0:37:25,700
 Yeah.

511
0:37:25,700 --> 0:37:25,740
 Yeah.

512
0:37:25,740 --> 0:37:25,800
 Yeah.

513
0:37:25,800 --> 0:37:25,820
 Yeah.

514
0:37:25,820 --> 0:37:25,840
 Yeah.

515
0:37:25,840 --> 0:37:25,860
 Yeah.

516
0:37:25,860 --> 0:37:25,880
 Yeah.

517
0:37:25,880 --> 0:37:25,940
 Yeah.

518
0:37:25,940 --> 0:37:25,960
 Yeah.

519
0:37:25,960 --> 0:37:25,980
 Yeah.

520
0:37:25,980 --> 0:37:26,020
 Yeah.

521
0:37:26,240 --> 0:37:26,540
 Yeah.

522
0:37:26,540 --> 0:37:26,560
 Yeah.

523
0:37:26,560 --> 0:37:26,580
 Yeah.

524
0:37:26,580 --> 0:37:26,740
 Yeah.

525
0:37:26,740 --> 0:37:26,780
 Yeah.

526
0:37:26,780 --> 0:37:26,800
 Yeah.

527
0:37:26,800 --> 0:37:26,840
 Yeah.

528
0:37:26,840 --> 0:37:27,640
 That's absolutely correct.

529
0:37:27,880 --> 0:37:33,380
 The church in Denmark used to be part of the administration, and they used to be center

530
0:37:33,380 --> 0:37:34,220
 in the administration.

531
0:37:34,420 --> 0:37:40,480
 The priests were administrators in Danish, and these church books also contain a lot

532
0:37:40,480 --> 0:37:46,440
 of very interesting information, which comes about people who got divorced, or if the priest

533
0:37:46,440 --> 0:37:49,200
 didn't like a person, he actually wrote stuff down.

534
0:37:49,300 --> 0:37:55,060
 I've been sifting through the church book at Eerø, a small Danish island, a while ago,

535
0:37:55,060 --> 0:37:55,100
 and he wrote a lot of stuff down.

536
0:37:55,100 --> 0:37:55,120
 I've been sifting through the church book at Eerø, a small Danish island, a while ago,

537
0:37:55,120 --> 0:37:59,960
 And he actually made, one of the priests some hundred years ago,

538
0:38:00,020 --> 0:38:02,360
 he made notes about people's character.

539
0:38:03,060 --> 0:38:05,320
 This guy is not good, or things like that.

540
0:38:05,340 --> 0:38:06,300
 It was inside there.

541
0:38:06,960 --> 0:38:08,440
 What they're going to use for that, I don't know.

542
0:38:08,540 --> 0:38:13,740
 But what they're going to do is they're going to build a tree of how people are connected

543
0:38:13,740 --> 0:38:21,680
 and who was with, and there will probably be some disclosures of who's actually the father of this child.

544
0:38:22,040 --> 0:38:24,820
 And that might cause some tragedies around.

545
0:38:25,120 --> 0:38:28,140
 Thanks for your talk.

546
0:38:28,720 --> 0:38:32,720
 I've got a note there because I think many of the problems you described

547
0:38:32,720 --> 0:38:36,220
 are not primarily problems of optimization or technology,

548
0:38:36,460 --> 0:38:43,380
 but mostly about companies or government not giving a shit about certain types of people.

549
0:38:43,380 --> 0:38:47,580
 And technology kind of amplifies that.

550
0:38:48,000 --> 0:38:52,700
 But it's not technology itself that is evil here.

551
0:38:54,140 --> 0:38:54,640
 Yeah, so.

552
0:38:55,120 --> 0:38:59,640
 Yeah, it just amplifies existing power structures and economic structures,

553
0:38:59,840 --> 0:39:04,200
 and that's why we've got so much technology that's designed in a terrible way today.

554
0:39:05,200 --> 0:39:06,360
 I totally agree.

555
0:39:07,580 --> 0:39:15,200
 But the main problem is that our politicians and the guys who built the systems don't know technology.

556
0:39:15,920 --> 0:39:22,540
 I wish we could take this camp with all these extremely bright and fantastic people here

557
0:39:22,540 --> 0:39:24,660
 and give them the chance to do that.

558
0:39:24,660 --> 0:39:24,720
 And give them the chance to do that.

559
0:39:24,720 --> 0:39:24,780
 And give them the chance to do that.

560
0:39:24,780 --> 0:39:25,100
 And give them the chance to do that.

561
0:39:25,100 --> 0:39:26,380
 And give them the chance to rebuild everything.

562
0:39:26,600 --> 0:39:29,620
 Because all the guys here know what we should do.

563
0:39:30,280 --> 0:39:32,380
 We should not make too much data.

564
0:39:32,520 --> 0:39:34,880
 We should give people the possibility to opt out.

565
0:39:35,320 --> 0:39:39,880
 We should also maybe even keep up an analog system behind

566
0:39:39,880 --> 0:39:43,140
 so people who can't figure out how to use a smartphone would have a chance.

567
0:39:43,920 --> 0:39:49,280
 It's very simple, but currently we have this, what I call digitalism.

568
0:39:49,500 --> 0:39:53,540
 There's an idea that we need to fit everything inside a mobile phone.

569
0:39:54,120 --> 0:39:54,980
 It's also true.

570
0:39:54,980 --> 0:39:55,020
 It's true.

571
0:39:55,020 --> 0:39:55,080
 It's true.

572
0:39:55,080 --> 0:39:55,100
 It's true.

573
0:39:55,100 --> 0:39:55,160
 It's true.

574
0:39:55,160 --> 0:39:55,320
 It's true.

575
0:39:55,320 --> 0:40:02,640
 When we look at the current solutions like the new MyID, for example, which is being built,

576
0:40:03,600 --> 0:40:08,060
 I think they're just looking at what kind of gear do I have myself.

577
0:40:08,400 --> 0:40:11,940
 I'm sitting here with this very nice iPhone 12.

578
0:40:12,580 --> 0:40:14,680
 And then we should build something for that.

579
0:40:15,400 --> 0:40:20,060
 And for me, for the guys inside the digitalization agency, it might be very smart for them

580
0:40:20,060 --> 0:40:24,160
 to have another app that can solve some problems for them.

581
0:40:24,160 --> 0:40:24,760
 But it's not.

582
0:40:25,100 --> 0:40:28,480
 a one-way solution for people in general.

583
0:40:28,480 --> 0:40:31,980
 And Denmark, we are crazy about digitizing.

584
0:40:31,980 --> 0:40:34,760
 If you look all science about what they're doing

585
0:40:34,760 --> 0:40:39,560
 in other countries, they keep up the analog systems behind.

586
0:40:39,560 --> 0:40:41,460
 In all the other countries in Europe,

587
0:40:41,460 --> 0:40:43,840
 it's an option to go digital.

588
0:40:44,860 --> 0:40:46,600
 It's not something we get forced into.

589
0:40:46,600 --> 0:40:50,020
 In Denmark, we get forced into using digital posts

590
0:40:50,020 --> 0:40:52,780
 and we need to do stuff and we're getting more

591
0:40:52,780 --> 0:40:54,260
 and if we're not getting forced,

592
0:40:54,260 --> 0:40:56,260
 we're getting notched into doing it

593
0:40:56,260 --> 0:40:58,880
 by kind of degrading all the stuff

594
0:40:58,880 --> 0:41:01,580
 that's currently going on on the analog side

595
0:41:01,580 --> 0:41:03,980
 and saying this is bad and you shouldn't use it.

596
0:41:05,840 --> 0:41:07,980
 But it would be very nice if one day

597
0:41:07,980 --> 0:41:12,880
 we could just lift this whole camp into a ball

598
0:41:12,880 --> 0:41:15,640
 at the Danish and say, now we'll tell you what to do,

599
0:41:15,640 --> 0:41:17,600
 but probably not gonna happen.

600
0:41:20,380 --> 0:41:21,420
 Any more questions?

601
0:41:23,580 --> 0:41:24,260
 Give a rig.

602
0:41:24,260 --> 0:41:26,500
 And a big hand of applause for Anas Keoul.

603
0:41:26,500 --> 0:41:27,840
 Thank you very much.
