# BornHack subtitles

Goal: Create subtitles for talks at BornHack

Inspiration: Some chaos events use [c3subtitles](https://c3subtitles.de/) to creating subtitles for talks. 
This serves multiple purposes: enabling folks who have hearing difficulties to access talk information and providing an option to follow talks silently in the background.

There are two main tasks for this project:

1. Transcribe talks
2. Proof reading and fine-tuning
